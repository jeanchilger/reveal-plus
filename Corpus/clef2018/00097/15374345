On the efficacy of piracetam in geriatric patients with acute cerebral ischemia: a clinically controlled double-blind study. Using a randomized, double blind group comparison, the efficacy and tolerance of piracetam as an additional therapy of hydroxyethyl starch, venous infusion and low dose heparin treatment, which are the basis of therapy in our hospital, has been studied in patients displaying acute cerebral ischemia. A total of 56 patients were enrolled, of whom 27 were given piracetam and 29 served as a control during a 28-day period. Using single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) analysis, we observed that in 23 piracetam-treated patients (85.2%) a reduction in the area of brain regions displaying an impaired flow rate occurred (P < 0.001 Fisher's exact two-sided test). Only six of placebo-treated patients (20.7%) showed an improved flow rate. Analysis of the recorded computer tomography map gave an improvement coefficient >2 (flow rate marginally or better improved) for 23 piracetam patients as compared with 5 placebo patients (P < 0.001, Uleman test).
