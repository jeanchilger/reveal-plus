Assessment of dual-time-point 18F-FDG-PET imaging for pulmonary lesions. The objective of this study was to assess suitability of dual-time-point 18F-FDG [(18F)-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose]-PET imaging for differentiating between malignant and benign pulmonary lesions, whose size and maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) are greater than 10 mm and 2.5, respectively.A total of 38 patients, 27 with malignant lesions (n = 30), and 11 with benign lesions (n = 22), were investigated by performing two static acquisitions started at mean times t = 79 and t = 158 min after the tracer injection. A model analysis involving tissue 18F-FDG uptake and release has been developed and applied.Malignant lesions showed a SUV increase between the two acquisitions for 27 of 30 lesions, and a SUV decrease or constancy for the other three. Benign lesions showed a SUV increase in 19 of 22 lesions, and a SUV decrease in three (both increase and decrease were observed for multiple benign lesions in two patients).It is recommended that dual-time-point 18F-FDG-PET imaging is not indicated to differentiate between malignant and benign pulmonary lesions, whose size and maximal SUV are greater than 10 mm and 2.5, respectively. Furthermore, a model analysis suggests that the variation in SUV observed between early and delayed scans may be explained by different values of the 18F-FDG release/uptake ratio.
