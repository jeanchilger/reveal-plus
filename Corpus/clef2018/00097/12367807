New methods for early diagnosis of lung cancer. The recent promising results with low-dose CT have stimulated the revival of the scientific discussion on screening for early lung cancer and mark the end of a significant period with lack of progress. At the same time positron emission tomography has quickly shown its value as a staging tool. Also new endobronchial techniques such as autofluorescence bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasonography have shown remarkably increased sensitivity when used by experienced hands. Cytopathological risk markers in sputum are being developed and it is expected that combinations of these new diagnostic methods will help to increase the identification of asymptomatic lung cancer patients and turn into better survival figures.
