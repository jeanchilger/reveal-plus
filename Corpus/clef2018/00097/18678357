Autoradiographic and small-animal PET comparisons between (18)F-FMISO, (18)F-FDG, (18)F-FLT and the hypoxic selective (64)Cu-ATSM in a rodent model of cancer. Copper(II)-diacetyl-bis(N(4)-methylthiosemicarbazone), or Cu-ATSM, a hypoxia imaging agent, has been shown to be predictive of response to traditional cancer therapies in patients with a wide range of tumors. It is known that the environment of the tumor results in a myriad of physiological consequences, including hypoxia, alterations in metabolism and proliferation. In an effort to better characterize the relationships between Cu-ATSM and other prominent radiopharmaceuticals, this current study was undertaken to compare the regional distribution of (64)Cu-ATSM with [(18)F]fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO), [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ((18)F-FDG) and [(18)F]fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) in 9L tumors.Taking advantage of the different half-life of (18)F (t(1/2)=110 min) in comparison to (64)Cu (t(1/2)=12.7 h), we undertook a dual-tracer autoradiography study in 9L tumors. Four groups were examined: (a) (18)F-FMISO, 2 h postinjection (p.i.) and (64)Cu-ATSM, 10 min p.i. (b) (18)F-FMISO, 2 h p.i. and (64)Cu-ATSM, 24 h p.i.It was shown that the regional distribution of (18)F-FMISO and (64)Cu-ATSM showed an excellent correlation when the (64)Cu-ATSM had been allowed to distribute for either 10 min (R(2)=.84) or 24 h (R(2)=.86). The regional comparisons between (64)Cu-ATSM (10 min) and (18)F-FDG (1 h) resulted in a very poor correlation (R(2)=.08) between the regional uptake of the two agents. The comparison between (18)F-FLT and (64)Cu-ATSM showed a strong relationship (R(2)=.83) between the two tracers. The small-animal PET images for the distribution comparisons between (64)Cu-ATSM and (18)F-FMISO and (18)F-FLT were in agreement with the data generated from the autoradiography studies.The data show that it is important to remember that a number of different metabolic situations can exist when considering the relationship between regions of high glucose uptake, proliferation and hypoxia.
