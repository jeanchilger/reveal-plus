99Tcm-labelled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody for tumour immunoscintigraphy: first clinical results. Twenty patients with malignant carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-producing tumour recurrences (colorectal n = 14 breast, lung, medullary thyroid carcinoma n = 2, each) were studied by immunoscintigraphy using an intact monoclonal anti-CEA antibody (BW 431/26) labelled with 99Tcm by a new labelling technique (Schwarz Method). This novel approach allows an almost quantitative labelling of the antibody, which is first reduced using a thiol, lyophilized in purified form, and then reacted with a stannous salt component before 99Tcm-pertechnetate binding. The labelling efficiency (as controlled by TLC) was greater than 95%, the in vitro stability at least 6 h. The imaging results (planar and SPECT) yielded a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 87% and a diagnostic accuracy of 90%. These first promising clinical results trigger the hope that the successful labelling of monoclonal antibodies with 99Tcm is a decisive step towards the more practically orientated use of tumour immunoscintigraphy.
