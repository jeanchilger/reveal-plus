Study of an unusual paratyphoid epornitic in canaries (Serinus canaria). High mortalities in 17 canary flocks from different regions of Tehran, Iran, were reported. Necropsy and histopathologic examination revealed necrotic hepatitis and overall congestive septicaemia in carcasses. Salmonella enterica was isolated from 34 examined samples, two samples from each flock, including visceral organs of carcasses and droppings of live diseased birds. All isolates were typed as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by conventional serotyping. Antibiotic resistance profiling using 33 antibiotics and random amplification of polymorphic DNA differentiation by three primers were performed and showed an identical clonal relationship between these isolates and S. Typhimurium isolated from a sample of feedstuffs. Changing the feed ingredients along with antibiotic therapy via the drinking water by enrofloxacin solution controlled the outbreaks, and mortalities ceased. The zoonotic nature of S. Typhimurium and close contact of bird owners with pet birds in the home environment made the case significant in relation to public health.
