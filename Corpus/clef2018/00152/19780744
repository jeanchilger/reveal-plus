The obstructed hemivagina, ipsilateral renal anomaly, uterus didelphys triad. The triad of obstructed hemivagina, renal anomaly and uterus didelphys is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain and menstrual discomfort in adolescent girls. Accurate diagnosis and surgical treatment can be delayed for several months or even years. Adolescent girls presenting with these symptoms should have a baseline pelvic ultrasound scan to establish uterine anatomy. In those with ultrasound findings of Müllerian anomalies appropriate follow up would include a magnetic resonance imaging, preferably at a tertiary centre with expertise in interpretation of Müllerian anatomy, as well as early consultation and referral to a centre with experience in the management of these rare conditions. Appropriate surgery would be a single stage procedure to either excise or completely divide the obstructing septum. There is currently no consensus on concurrent laparoscopy. We present a case series of four patients with the triad of uterus didelphys, obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis managed between 2005-2009 at a tertiary centre for paediatric and adolescent gynaecology.
