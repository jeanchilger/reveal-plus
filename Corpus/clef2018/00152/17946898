Hysteroscopic simulator for training and educational purposes. Hysteroscopy is an extensively popular option in evaluating and treating women with infertility. The procedure utilizes an endoscope, inserted through the vagina and cervix to examine the intra-uterine cavity via a monitor. The difficulty of hysteroscopy from the surgeon's perspective is the visual spatial perception of interpreting 3D images on a 2D monitor, and the associated psychomotor skills in overcoming the fulcrum-effect. Despite the widespread use of this procedure, current qualified hysteroscopy surgeons have not been trained the fundamentals through an organized curriculum. The emergence of virtual reality as an educational tool for this procedure, and for other endoscopic procedures, has undoubtedly raised interests. The ultimate objective is for the inclusion of virtual reality training as a mandatory component for gynecological endoscopic training. Part of this process involves the design of a simulator, encompassing the technical difficulties and complications associated with the procedure. The proposed research examines fundamental hysteroscopic factors as well as current training and accreditation norms, and proposes a hysteroscopic simulator design that is suitable for educating and training.
