Comparison of the measurement line cervical and endometrial ultrasound techniques using two. Cervical and endometrial measurement in the gynecological and obstetric patients is of vital importance. There is no consensus for the correct way in which should be made the measurement, more than anything is for an opinion of some experts.To determine whether there are differences in measurement of endometrial or sagittal cross section of the uterus and cervix in the measurement of fractional linear fashion or along the cervical canal.Using a transvaginal ultrasound, was measured in a transverse and longitudinal endometrial lining. And by fractional measuring along the cervical canal and a linear manner from the internal to the external.We studied a total of 63 patients. The mean endometrial transversal measurement in a cross was 7.1. mm (SD +/- 3.3) The mean endometrial longitudinally measured were: 7.9 mm (SD +/- 3.4). The mean cervical measurement was fractionally 3.3 cm (SD +/- 0.4) Mean cervical linear measurement was 3.9 cm (SD +/- 0.4). Using student's t test where the value of p in the endometrial measurement was 0.0871 and p value in cervical measurement was 0.009, the latter being statistically significant.With respect to the measurement of the endometrial lining, there is no significant difference do any of the two different techniques. However, measurement of the cervix, another significant difference (p = 0.009), so it should be further investigated which of these two techniques is the right way to establish more accurate diagnoses.
