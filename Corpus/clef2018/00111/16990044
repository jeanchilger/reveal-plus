The incidence of pneumonia in rural Thailand. Pneumonia continues to be a leading infectious disease killer, yet accurately measuring incidence remains a challenge. In 2002, Thailand began active, population-based surveillance for radiographically confirmed pneumonia in Sa Kaeo Province.Full-time surveillance officers conducted active case ascertainment at every hospital, and routine audits and a community cluster survey promoted complete and accurate reporting. A case of pneumonia was defined as acute infection with signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and evidence of new infiltrates. An independent panel of radiologists reviewed digital images of all radiographs.Between September 2002 and August 2003, 777 patients met the case definition. The measured minimum incidence was 177/100,000 but the estimated incidence was as high as 580/100,000 with full adjustment for incomplete chest radiography and access to health care. Seventy-two (9%) patients died and 28% were known to be HIV positive. Fifteen (2%) patients had pneumonia twice during the year. The average cost of hospitalization for an episode of pneumonia ranged from US$490.80 to $628.60.Pneumonia is a significant and costly public health problem in Thailand. This surveillance system allows precise assessment and monitoring of radiologically confirmed pneumonia and lays the groundwork for the introduction of new vaccines against pneumonia pathogens.
