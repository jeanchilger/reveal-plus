Advances in the management of Chlamydia pneumoniae infections. One of the major characteristics of Chlamydia spp. is its ability to cause prolonged, often subclinical infections. Chronic, persistent infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases initially not thought to be infectious, including asthma, arthritis and atherosclerosis. C. pneumoniae is susceptible in vitro to a wide range of antimicrobial agents that target either protein or DNA synthesis, including macrolides, ketolides, tetracyclines, quinolones and rifamycins. Practically all treatment studies evaluating presented or published to date have used serology alone for diagnosis of C. pneumoniae infection, which only provides a clinical end point. The results of several treatment studies that did perform culture found that erythromycin, azithromycin (Zithromax, clarithromycin (Biaxin, levofloxacin (Levaquin and moxifloxacin (Avelox had a 70 to 90% efficacy in eradicating C. pneumoniae from the respiratory tract of children and adults with pneumonia. Persistence of the organism does not appear to be due to the development of antibiotic resistance. However, one cannot extrapolate from this experience to the treatment of chronic C. pneumoniae infection, especially cardiovascular disease. As there are no reliable serologic markers for chronic or persistent C. pneumoniae infection, it cannot be determined who is infected and who is not, which means that it cannot be assumed that any effect seen is due to successful treatment or eradication of C. pneumoniae.
