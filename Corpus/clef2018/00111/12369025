The use of pulse oximetry to exclude pneumonia in children. The objective of this study was to determine whether pulse oximetry alone or in conjunction with the clinical examination is predictive of pneumonia in children who present to the emergency department with respiratory complaints. A retrospective comparison of children with radiographic pneumonia with children with respiratory complaints and negative chest radiography was used. The study took place in an emergency department of a large academic, tertiary care hospital. All children less than 24 months of age who presented with a respiratory complaint and underwent chest radiography during a 1-year period were included. Charts of children with radiographic pneumonia were compared with charts of children without pneumonia, retrospectively. Data abstracted onto data collection forms included: pulse oximetry measurement, vital signs, general appearance, lung examination, and final radiology interpretation of chest radiographs. Pneumonia was defined as a chest radiograph showing any opacity consistent with pneumonia as read by a board-prepared or -certified radiologist. A total of 803 children qualified for the study. Radiograph interpretations were available for 762, and 10.5% were found to have radiographic pneumonia. The median pulse oximetry reading of children with radiographic pneumonia was 97% (interquartile range 95th-98th percentile) compared with 98% (interquartile range 96th-99th percentile) in the control group. Forty-five percent (35 of 78) of the children with radiographic pneumonia showed oxygen saturations of 98% or higher with greater than 10% (8 of 78) displaying oxygen saturations of 100%. By using logistic regression, pulse oximetry was not found to be a statistically significant predictive variable for radiographic pneumonia. Pulse oximetry could not be used to rule out the presence of radiographic pneumonia in children less than 2 years of age who presented with respiratory complaints.
