The influence of heartbeat acceptance window settings on left ventricular function and perfusion parameters. To evaluate the influence of heartbeat acceptance window settings on left ventricular function and perfusion parameters of the arrhythmia patients during gated myocardial perfusion imaging.Twenty eight fibrillation patients were consecutively recruited to undergo myocardial perfusion SPECT. The Concurrent Imaging software was used to create 3 separate SPECT studies with heartbeat acceptance window of 20%, 60% and 100% respectively. The software created the 3 studies separately rather than a rearrangement of an original list-mode acquisition. After reconstruction by Astonish, end-diastole volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), sum stress score (SSS), and sum rest score (SRS) were calculated with Quantitative Gated SPECT (QGS). Analyses of variance were performed using SPSS to compare the differences in EDV, ESV, EF, SSS, and SRS among the three studies.85.7% of the 28 patients had abnormal perfusing. No statistical differences were found in EDV, ESV, EF, SSS, and SRS among the 3 studies. But the collection time was 40.5 min, 25.6 min and 15.0 min for heartbeat acceptance window of 20%, 60% and 100% respectively.Heartbeat acceptance window setting does not have a significant effect on EDV, ESV, EF, SSS, and SRS values. The wider the window is set, the shorter the collection time is.
