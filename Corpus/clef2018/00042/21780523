Restaging the mediastinum in non-small cell lung cancer after induction therapy: non-invasive versus invasive procedures. Nodal status after induction therapy in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an independent prognostic factor for survival. Prognosis is poor in patients with persisting mediastinal lymph node involvement.From February 2000 to September 2007, restaging for NSCLC was performed in 25 patients (23 men, 2 women) by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) as well as repeat mediastinoscopy. Initial proof of N2 or N3 disease was obtained by mediastinoscopy.The non-invasive restaging modalities CT and PET had a rather low accuracy of 64% and 72%, respectively. Repeat mediastinoscopy performed better with an accuracy of 84%.Histological proof of mediastinal involvement after induction therapy in NSCLC is necessary to select those patients who will benefit from surgical resection. When a first mediastinoscopy has been performed to obtain pathological proof of N2 or N3 disease, repeat mediastinoscopy proves to be more accurate than CT or PET scanning for mediastinal restaging.
