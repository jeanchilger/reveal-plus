In vivo monitoring of drugs using radiotracer techniques. There is an increasing realization of the role of non-invasive monitoring of drug pharmacology. In this review, we discuss the role of positron emission tomography in such monitoring of tumour and normal tissue drug pharmacokinetics as well as assessment of tumour response, drug-receptor interactions and mechanisms of drug action and resistance. These studies represent a multidisciplinary research effort involving radiochemists, imaging scientists, clinicians, pharmacologists and mathematical modellers. This review evaluates achievements in the field from assessment of commonly used therapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil to target specific molecules such as markers for gene expression. It is envisaged that application of this technology will facilitate rational drug design and rapid translation of new ideas to the bedside.
