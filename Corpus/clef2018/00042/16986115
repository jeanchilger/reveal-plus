Evaluation of treatment effects in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases by MRI and MRS. Neurodegeneration refers to a large clinically and pathologically heterogeneous disease entity associated with slowly progressive neuronal loss in different anatomical and functional systems of the brain. Neurodegenerative diseases often affect cognition, e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies and vascular dementia, or different aspects of the motor system, e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and ataxic disorders. Owing to increasing knowledge about the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration, the development of treatments able to modify the neurodegenerative process becomes possible for the first time. Currently, clinical outcome measures are used to assess the efficacy of such treatments. However, most clinical outcome measures have a low test-retest reliability and thus considerable measurement variance. Therefore, large patient populations and long observation times are needed to detect treatment effects. Furthermore, clinical outcome measures cannot distinguish between symptomatic and disease-modifying treatment effects. Therefore, alternative biomarkers including neuroimaging may take on a more important role in this process. Because MR scanners are widely available and allow for non-invasive detection and quantification of changes in brain structure and metabolism, there is increasing interest in the use of MRI/MRS to monitor objectively treatment effects in clinical trials of neurodegenerative diseases. Particularly volumetric MRI has been used to measure atrophy rates in treatment trials of AD because the relationship between atrophic changes and neuron loss is well established and correlates well with clinical measures. More research is needed to determine the value of other MR modalities, i.e. diffusion, perfusion and functional MRI and MR spectroscopy, for clinical trials with neuroprotective drugs.
