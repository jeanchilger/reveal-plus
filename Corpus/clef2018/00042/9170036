Evaluation of peri-infarcted hypoperfusion with T2*-weighted dynamic MRI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate cerebral perfusion with T2*-weighted dynamic MRI in the area around the infarcted core. We examined seven patients with subacute cerebral infarction. After bolus injection a gadopentetate dimeglumine, a series of gradient-echo images were recorded in a selected slice. From these images, concentration-time curves were created on a region-of-interest (ROI) basis around infarction for calculating relative regional cerebral blood volume (rrCBV). Brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study also was performed with intravenous injection of 123I-labeled N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP). All patients showed prolonged signal decrease in the area around the infarcted core. ROI analysis showed significantly increased rrCBV compared to the normal side (P < .01, paired t test). The 123I-IMP SPECT study showed that these areas had decreased cerebral blood flow. Theses findings suggest compensatory vascular dilatation due to decreased perfusion pressure. T2*-weighted dynamic MRI is a useful method for detecting compensatory vasodilatation of ischemic insult in the peri-infarcted area.
