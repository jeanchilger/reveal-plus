New developments in perfusion imaging by bolus tracking. The author describes the theoretical basis of quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT) by the bolus tracking method: i.e.dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI using very rapid imaging to capture the first pass of intravenously injected paramagnetic contrast agent.
