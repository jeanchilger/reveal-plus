3D-MR mammography-guided breast conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: clinical results and future perspectives with reference to FDG-PET. Three dimensional MR Mammography (3D-MRM) can detect tumor extension more accurately than mammography or ultrasound. There are two shrinkage patterns observed by 3D-MRM after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Concentric shrinkage is a good indication for breast conserving surgery. On the other hand, a dendritic pattern was represent ductal spread. Therefore, we developed MRM guided mapping to aid BCS for tumors showing a dendritic pattern.Fifteen patients consisting of 8 stage II (T > 3.5 cm) cases and 7 stage IIIa cases aged 39 to 61 years (mean 47-8 years) were treated with AT neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the aim of performing breast conserving surgery. All patients were examined by 3D-MRM before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Breast conserving surgery indications were determined by tumor volume reduction and shrinkage patterns on 3D-MRM. Supine position mapping using MRM was performed for dendritic type tumors. FDG-PET was simultaneously performed for one case with bilateral breast cancer.Breast conserving surgery was performed for 13 of the 15 cases. One case underwent re-operating and mastectomy because of a positive margin. One case had microscopically positive margin and received boost radiation. Therefore, 11 of 15 cases (73.3%) underwent BCS and achieved negative margins under MRM guidance. PET scanning can detect residual tumor and occult metastasis but it is not suitable for mapping because of its spatial resolution.3D-MRM is a useful modality to select appropriate cases for breast conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. FDG-PET can also detect residual tumor or occult metastasis but it may not be suitable for mapping. Because both examinations have potential, further evaluation of their clinical efficacy is necessary.
