Successful laparoscopic repair of refractory type Ia endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Type I endoleaks associated with sac enlargement after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair mandate urgent intervention. Endoluminal treatments are generally considered first, but when these fail, open surgery has been advocated as a last resort. Open surgery is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, and thus, approaches that reduce this risk would be of interest. We report a successful case of laparoscopic treatment of a refractory type Ia endoleak after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in an 83-year-old man.
