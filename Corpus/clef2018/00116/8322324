Marfan syndrome. Cardiovascular manifestations diagnosed by echocardiography. Echocardiographic and clinical evaluation was undertaken in 33 adult patients with Marfan syndrome. Cardiovascular manifestations were found in 32 (97%), mitral valve prolapse in 23 (70%) and dilated aortic root (> or = 21 mm/m2) in 26 patients (79%). The aortic root diameter was 58-85 mm in six patients with proximal aortic dissection, 57-76 mm in four patients undergoing elective surgery and 35-49 mm in conservatively treated patients. Average age at surgery was 28 years. Echocardiography with Doppler is the method of choice for diagnosis and control of patients with Marfan syndrome.
