Aortic valve replacement with stentless porcine aortic bioprosthesis. Twenty-nine patients were entered in a clinical trial on aortic valve replacement with a stentless glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine aortic valve. This bioprosthesis is secured to the aortic root by the same technique used for aortic valve replacement with aortic valve homografts. The functional results obtained from this operation have been most satisfactory. To assess the hemodynamic benefit of eliminating the stent of a porcine aortic valve, we matched 22 patients with a stentless porcine bioprosthesis for age, sex, body surface area, valve lesion, and bioprosthesis size to 22 patients who had aortic valve replacement with a Hancock II bioprosthesis. Mean and peak systolic gradients across the aortic bioprosthesis and effective aortic valve areas were obtained by Doppler studies. Gradients across the stentless bioprosthesis were significantly lower than gradients across the Hancock II valve for every bioprosthesis size. Effective aortic valve areas of the stentless bioprosthesis were significantly larger than the valve areas of the Hancock II valve. Our data demonstrate that the hemodynamic characteristics of a glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine aortic bioprosthesis are greatly improved when the aortic root is used as a stent for the valve. This technique of implantation is expected to enhance the durability of the bioprosthesis, because the aortic root may dampen the mechanical stress to which the leaflets are subjected during the cardiac cycle.
