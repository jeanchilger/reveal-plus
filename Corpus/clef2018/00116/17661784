Carotid and coronary artery occlusion in a patient with Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the aorta and its principal branches, leading to narrowing and occlusion of the vessels. Since the clinical manifestations depend on the location and severity of the lesions, stroke may be the initial presentation of the disease. Here we report the case of a young man with TA and complete thrombotic occlusion of the right common carotid artery who underwent surgical intervention at our institution. His postoperative computed tomography angiogram performed after 3 months revealed also total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery from its proximal portion.
