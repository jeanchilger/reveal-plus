Aortic valve replacement and graft replacement of the ascending aorta using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome. A 73-year-old woman with a 10-year history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) had severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) with a maximum diameter of 55 mm. By retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) in the patient under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), we replaced the ascending aorta graft and aortic valve. After surgery, we periodically administered granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) with platelet aggregation. On postoperative day 20, the patient had a duodenal ulcer. On postoperative day 22, she had a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was treated, nonoperatively, with a hemostatic agent. On postoperative day 126, she was discharged without sequelae, and 1.5 years after the surgery, she has had neither heart failure nor deterioration of MDS.
