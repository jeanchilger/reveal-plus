Diagnosis of extensive dissections of the thoracic aorta by 2-D echography. Dissecting aortic aneurysms require immediate diagnosis and accurate knowledge of extension. In two patients with dissecting aortic aneurysms the extension of the dissection could be evaluated by the noninvasive method of 2-D-echography. All aortic regions could be visualized in both cases, The diagnosis of dissection was established by visualization of intimal flaps in short and long exis views.
