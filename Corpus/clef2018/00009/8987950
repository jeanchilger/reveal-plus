Increased monocyte chemotactic protein-1 level and activity in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis. Le Groupe d'Investigation en Gynécologie. Our purpose was to evaluate monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in the peripheral blood of women with and without endometriosis.Fifty-seven patients with endometriosis at laparoscopy done for infertility and pelvic pain were compared with 44 fertile women with no evidence of endometriosis at tubal ligation by laparoscopy. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 concentration in the plasma was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and its biologic activity was evaluated by measuring monocyte chemotaxis with use of a human histiocytic cell line (U937).Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 concentrations (median and range of values) found in the plasma were higher in patients with endometriosis (163, 0 to 788 pg/ml) than in normal controls (0, 0 to 355 pg/ml). This elevation was significant only in the minimal stage of endometriosis (revised American Fertility Society stage I). However, increased chemotactic activity (mean number of migrating cells/mm2 +/- SEM) was found in the stages I (1240 +/- 141), II (519 +/- 30), and III-IV (523 +/- 23) of the disease compared with normal controls (205 +/- 20). A total of 35% to 44% of this activity was inhibited in the presence of an antibody specific to monocyte chemotactic protein-1.Endometriosis is associated with increased level and activity of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in the peripheral blood. The elevation and activation of this cytokine could play a relevant role in the immunoinflammatory process associated with the disease.
