Predictors of success after embryo transfer: experience from a single provider. Our goal was to examine the variables present at the time of embryo transfer and to determine their effects on the clinical pregnancy rate.All fresh and frozen embryo transfers during a 3-year period in a university-based in vitro fertilization program were examined. Female age, previous in vitro fertilization attempt, diagnosis, embryo number and quality, transfer technique, and presence of a clinical pregnancy were recorded for each couple. Logistic regression analyses were performed both univariately and multivariately to determine the association between a clinical pregnancy and the independent variables.All transfers during the study period were included in the analysis. The four primary diagnoses were pelvic or tubal disease, male factor infertility, unexplained infertility, and endometriosis. The 46 frozen embryo transfers had a clinical pregnancy rate similar to that among the 159 fresh embryo transfers and were therefore included in the analysis. One variable was found to significantly affect the outcome, the number of high-grade embryos placed. The presence of a previous failed embryo transfer tended to lower the success rate for future attempts however, this result did not reach statistical significance. The catheter type and the transfer difficulty did not affect outcome.The two most important variables for predicting a clinical pregnancy are a first-time transfer and the number of high-grade embryos placed. Neither the type of embryo transfer catheter used nor the diagnosis affected outcome. In this small sample difficult embryo transfers did not diminish the chance for a successful outcome.
