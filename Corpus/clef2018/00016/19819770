Systemic thrombolysis of portal vein thrombosis in cirrhotic patients: a pilot study. Portal vein thrombosis is a frequent complication in liver cirrhosis. Encouraging reports of systemic thrombolysis in non-cirrhotic patients suffering from acute portal vein thrombosis led us to start a pilot study on the efficacy and safety of systemic low dose recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (Actilyse, Boheringer Ingelheim, Florence, Italy).Nine cirrhotic patients (6 males and 3 females) with recent portal vein thrombosis were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were portal cavernomatosis, recent (30 days) surgery, active bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma and cancer in other sites.All cases were treated for a maximum of 7 days by continuous i.v. infusion of 0.25mg/kg/die of r-tPA plus subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin. Efficacy was evaluated by colour doppler sonography monitoring and confirmed by contrast enhanced computerized tomography.The combined r-tPA/LMWH treatment was well tolerated without clinically significant side effects. Complete resolution of thrombosis occurred in 4 cases, partial regression in 4 and none in 1. Retreatment of a complete recurrence in 1 patient was successful. Variceal pressure dropped from 30.7+/-4.5 mmHg to 21.2+/-6.6 mmHg (p=0.012).Our preliminary data demonstrate that thrombolytic treatment of recent portal vein thrombosis with i.v. r-tPA and LMWH in patients with cirrhosis appears to be safe and effective and can significantly reduce pressure in oesophageal varices.
