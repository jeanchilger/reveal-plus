Eroded valves, recurrent pleural effusions, and ultimately heart-liver transplant. A patient with eroded tricuspid and pulmonic valves, who eventually developed elevated right atrial and systemic venous pressure that led to hepatic cirrhosis and recurrent pleural effusion, is presented. The complex issues involved over a long period in this patient, who ultimately required combined heart and liver transplant, are discussed.
