Contrast-enhanced ultrasound techniques for guiding and assessing response to locoregional treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma. Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) are diagnosed in patients with cirrhosis and/or when tumor burden is too advanced for surgical treatment. In many of these cases the only suitable therapy is locoregional, percutaneous and/or intraarterial treatment. Moreover, the best way to guide and assess response to locoregional HCC treatment are two issues under discussion today. First-generation and subsequent second-generation microbubble contrast agents, together with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) imaging, have expanded the role of US techniques in HCC treatments. In this review our purpose is to illustrate the advantages, limits and potential of contrast-enhanced US application for locoregional HCC treatment.
