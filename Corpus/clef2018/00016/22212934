Hospital- and community-based screenings for hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan. In Taiwan, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been the leading cause of cancer incidence and mortality in recent decades. The majority of patients have hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The HBV carrier rate and incidence of HCC in children have declined with the implementation of a hepatitis B vaccination program for newborns since 1984. A combination of α-fetoprotein and ultrasonography (US) has been used for surveillance in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection in intervals of 3-6 and 6-12 months for cirrhosis and chronic liver disease, respectively. A secular survival improvement in HCC patients has been demonstrated. A reasonable screening protocol should include two stages. The first stage is identification of high-risk subjects and the second stage is US screening of high-risk subjects. Community-based HCC screening programs have been conducted for more than two decades in Taiwan. The commonly used first-stage markers are HBsAg and anti-HCV, while the platelet count should be a useful marker in HCV-endemic communities. The benefit of HCC screening was shown by a prolonged overall survival. However, this was limited to the early curable stage in elderly subjects. Prevention and control of HCC have multiple modalities. Identification of a high-risk group for active surveillance, effective antiviral treatment for chronic HBV and HCV infection, and early detection and prompt treatment of HCC should decrease the sequelae of HCC in Taiwan.
