Factor VII deficiency and a copper metabolism disorder in a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. We report on a patient with Klippel-Trenaunay (KT) syndrome, a factor VII deficiency and a copper metabolism disorder. The KT syndrome involved the left leg and, histologically, the liver. Dermatological examination, duplex ultrasonography and a skin and liver biopsy verified the KT syndrome. A long prothrombin time prompted clotting studies revealing a factor VII deficiency while the other factors were in the normal range. Further laboratory examinations showed a copper metabolism disorder similar to Wilson's disease with a low serum ceruloplasmin level, elevated copper concentration in the urine and increased copper deposition in the liver. Neither liver cirrhosis nor a Kayser-Fleischer corneal ring was present. Sequencing analysis of the Wilson's disease gene ATB7B showed no mutations. The occurrence of these three uncommon pathologies in a single patient has not been described to date, which may suggest a mutation in a hypothetical common regulatory gene leading to this unusual phenotype.
