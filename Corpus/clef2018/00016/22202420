Usefulness of intraoperative fluorescent imaging using indocyanine green for repeated resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. For recurrent hepatic tumors with treatment history or cirrhosis, small region including extrahepatic tumors that cannot be identified on routine ultrasonography, we used a fluorescent imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) for repeated resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patients were consisted of 4 men and 2 women with a mean age of 61.5 (37-66) years. Five cases of intra or extra hepatic tumors could be identified with fluorescent imaging system. Two cases were a local recurrence after TACE, 1 case was a small tumor exited in liver surface, 1 case could be identified the area of vascular invasion of subcutaneous recurrence, and 1 case was a mediastinal small lymph node metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Fluorescent imaging using ICG was considered to be useful for identification of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma that cannot be identified by a routine ultrasonography.
