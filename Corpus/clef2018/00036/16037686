Clinical applications of endoscopic ultrasound to oncology. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a useful imaging modality in patients with certain gastrointestinal malignancies as well as lung cancer. In many cases, EUS has been shown to have superior staging accuracy compared with other imaging techniques such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. This article will review the role of EUS in diagnosing and staging esophageal, rectal, pancreatic and lung cancers as well as subepithelial lesions. Newer therapeutic applications of EUS, namely endoscopic mucosal resection for removal of localized lesions as well as celiac plexus neurolysis for pain control, will also be discussed.
