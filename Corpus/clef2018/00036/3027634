131I and 111In-labelled monoclonal antibody imaging of primary lung carcinoma. Preliminary clinical studies have been carried out to determine whether the monoclonal antibody 791T/36 would localize in primary lung cancer to an extent sufficient for external detection by gamma scintigraphy. Radiolabelling of the antibody with 131I permitted visualization of three out of eight (38%) tumours using planar imaging with 99Tcm-labelled blood pool subtraction. Radiolabelling of the same antibody with 111In permitted visualization of tumour uptake in nine out of 13 (69%) tumours, without the need for image subtraction. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies of seven patients demonstrated concentration of 111In-labelled antibody at the tumour site in each case, four of which were visualized on the planar images. The present study demonstrates localization of the 791T/36 antibody in primary lung carcinoma and confirms the superiority of 111In over 131I as a radiolabel for antibody imaging, especially when emission tomography is performed. These data indicate that further work will be required to determine whether this antibody will be a suitable carrier for cytotoxic agents in the therapy of lung cancer.
