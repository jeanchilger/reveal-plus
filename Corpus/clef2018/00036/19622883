T2*-weighted MRI versus oxygen extraction fraction PET in acute stroke. Mapping high oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in acute stroke is of considerable interest to depict the at-risk tissue. Being sensitive to deoxyhemoglobin, T2*-weighted MRI has been suggested as a potential marker of high OEF.We compared T2*-weighted images from pre-contrast arrival perfusion scans against quantitative positron emission tomography in 5 patients studied 7-21 h after onset of carotid territory stroke. OEF and T2* signal were obtained in the voxels with significantly high OEF.All patients showed increased OEF. No significant relationship between OEF and T2*-weighted signal was found either within or between subjects.We found no indication that T2*-weighted MRI in the way implemented in this investigation was sensitive to high OEF in acute stroke.
