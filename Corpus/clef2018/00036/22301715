Review of radiation reduction strategies in clinical cardiovascular imaging. The use of ionizing radiation for medical diagnostic tests and interventional procedures has grown substantially over the past 2 decades, and there is now considerable concern expressed in both the medical literature and the lay press of the harmful effects of radiation exposure. Although there is some controversy regarding whether this medical radiation is actually harmful, minimizing the dose to the patient is logical and a basic part of proper care. To do this, clinicians must have an understanding of the amount of radiation that is involved with each test. Physicians have a responsibility to keep the level of radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable. A number of simple and common sense measures can help achieve this goal. Encouragingly, there are also numerous new technologies which can substantially lower radiation dose, especially in cardiovascular studies. This review will highlight various ways to reduce radiation in cardiovascular imaging.
