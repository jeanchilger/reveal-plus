The biology of photodynamic therapy. The subcellular, cellular and tissue/tumour interactions with non-toxic photosensitizing chemicals plus non-thermal visible light (photodynamic therapy (PDT) are reviewed. The extent to which endothelium/vasculature is the primary target is discussed, and the biochemical opportunities for manipulating outcome highlighted. The nature of tumour destruction by PDT lends itself to imaging outcome by MRI and PET.
