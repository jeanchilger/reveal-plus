Solitary pulmonary nodule in the liver transplant candidate: importance of diagnosis and treatment. Our objectives were to define the incidence and etiology of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) in patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), describe a diagnostic approach to the management of SPNs in LDLT, and define the impact of SPNs on the overall survival of adult LDLT recipients. Nine patients (9/152, 5.9%) were diagnosed with an SPN on the basis of chest radiography findings during the pretransplant survey. All were male. The mean age was 52 years. All the patients had hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. All were asymptomatic for the lung lesion. All underwent contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) to verify the presence and possible etiology of the SPNs. In 3 cases, CT was used to definitely determine that there was no pulmonary nodule in 2, CT led to a definite diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. In 4, CT led to a definite identification of an SPN but not to an etiological diagnosis. Two patients underwent outright thoracoscopy and biopsy of their SPNs. Biopsy showed cryptococcosis in both patients. One received a therapeutic trial of an antituberculosis treatment, and repeat CT after 1 month showed a regression in the size of the SPN. A diagnosis of tuberculosis was made. One patient had an inconclusive whole body positron emission tomography scan and subsequently underwent thoracoscopy where biopsy showed tuberculosis. A concomitant malignancy, either primary lung cancer or metastasis from the liver tumor, was not identified. All patients were surviving with their original grafts and were lung infection-free. The overall mean posttransplant follow-up was 54 months (range = 33-96 months).
