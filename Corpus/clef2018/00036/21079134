European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recommendations for planning and delivery of high-dose, high-precision radiotherapy for lung cancer. To derive recommendations for routine practice and clinical trials for techniques used in high-dose, high-precision thoracic radiotherapy for lung cancer.A literature search was performed to identify published articles considered both clinically relevant and practical to use. Recommendations were categorized under the following headings: patient selection, patient positioning and immobilization, tumor motion, computed tomography and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission technology scanning, generating target volumes, radiotherapy treatment planning, treatment delivery, and scoring of response and toxicity. The American College of Chest Physicians grading of recommendations was used.Recommendations were identified for each of the recommendation categories. Although most of the recommended techniques have not been evaluated in multicenter clinical trials, their use in high-precision thoracic radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) appears to be justified on the basis of available evidence.Recommendations to facilitate the clinical implementation of high-precision conformal radiotherapy and SBRT for lung tumors were identified from the literature. Some techniques that are considered investigational at present were also highlighted.
