Blunt carotid artery trauma: report of two cases and review of the literature. Blunt carotid artery trauma is uncommon but has been associated with severe, permanent neurologic deficits in 42% and mortality in 30% of 96 patients previously reported in the English literature. Since neurologic symptoms characteristically develop only after a latent interval and since physical evidence of significant cervical trauma often is absent, diagnosis of nonpenetrating carotid injuries with the use of arteriography usually is delayed until the appearance of obvious, frequently irreversible neurologic complications. Carotid injuries should be suspected in patients who develop monoplegia or hemiplegia following blunt craniocervical trauma, particularly if computerized tomography excludes the presence of intracranial hemorrhage. The cumulative results of a collected series of 96 patients suggest that early surgical correction of blunt carotid injuries is appropriate for patients with transient episodes of cerebral ischemia, strokes in evolution, or mild completed neurologic deficits.
