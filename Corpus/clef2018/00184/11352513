CT angiography of the carotid arteries in trauma to the neck. serious vascular injuries to the neck may be asymptomatic or masked by other life-threatening conditions. Angiography, the "gold standard" vascular imaging modality, is an invasive procedure. Moreover, it is time-consuming and thus may delay a needed vascular intervention. The results of screening angiography are negative in more than 80% of cases. Therefore other less invasive and faster screening tests, such as the Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography, have been tested. This retrospective study was done to evaluate the use of CT angiography (CTA) in suspected vascular injuries of the neck.from 1995 to 1998, 16 patients with suspected traumatic carotid artery injury underwent CTA. Twelve of these patients had penetrating injuries and four had blunt injuries to the neck. CTAs were obtained by Elscint Twin Flash Spiral Scanner, while MIP reconstructions were carried out on an Omnipro, Elscint (Indy, Silicon Graphics) work station and interpreted by a radiologist.all the CTAs were diagnostic. Positive findings included one complete tear of the right common carotid artery (confirmed by surgery) due to a penetrating injury and one bilateral internal carotid artery thrombosis after blunt injury to the neck. In addition, three patients with multiple trauma were operated on, due to either proximity only or questionable neurological findings. Surgical exploration confirmed the negative findings seen on CTA.CT angiography of the carotid arteries in cervical trauma may be used as an accurate decisive tool for a needed surgical intervention. More studies with larger number of patients and comparison with angiography are needed.
