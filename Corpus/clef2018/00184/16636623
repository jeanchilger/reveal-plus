Complete L1-L2 lateral dislocation without fracture and neurologic deficit in a child. Spinal injuries in the infantile age group are relatively rare, mainly due to anatomical and biomechanical features of the pediatric spine. With its hypermobile character, pediatric spine can withstand trauma without fracture, and the elastic nature of the young spine allows easy slippage between segments, especially under the age of 8. Clinically, a few of the cases present with subluxation only, which seldom involve the lumbar level. We report an extremely rare case of traumatic complete upper lumbar lateral lystesis in a 3-year-old boy. The patient was treated conservatively and followed up for 2 years with some degree of correction.
