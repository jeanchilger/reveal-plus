Prognostic value of volumetric parameters measured by F-18 FDG PET/CT in surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the tumor burden as characterized by the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) measured by F-18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) PET-computed tomography (CT) in predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in surgically resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.We retrospectively reviewed 91 patients with pathologically documented stages I-IIIA NSCLC. MTV and TLG were obtained according to various thresholds of the standard uptake value (SUV) of primary tumor using preoperative F-18 FDG PET-CT. We used comparison receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis to test the statistical significance of the differences among the multiple volumetric parameters calculated by various SUV cutoff values. RFS and OS were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis.On comparison receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, no significant difference was found among the volumetric parameters calculated using various thresholds of SUV. Regardless of the thresholds, patients with smaller MTV and lower TLG showed longer RFS and OS. MTV and TLG measured by F-18 FDG PET-CT were found to have better predictive performance than SUVmax for recurrence and death. According to multivariate analyses, MTV2.5 was revealed as a significant prognostic factor for RFS. Tumor size over 3 cm was selected as a significant prognostic indicator of OS.Volume-based parameters of F-18 FDG PET-CT may have a role in providing prognostic information in NSCLC patients who have received surgical treatment.
