Advances in imaging. In recent years there have been major advances in chest imaging. These include significant refinements in previously available techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and the introduction of new techniques into the clinical armamentarium, particularly positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. These advances have led to changes in the diagnostic approach to a number of conditions, particularly pulmonary embolism, lung cancer, diseases of the large and small airways, and diffuse lung disease. They have also brought new insights into the pathophysiology of lung disease. State of the art CT and MR imaging now allow objective quantification of lung disease and assessment of regional changes in ventilation and perfusion caused by airway and parenchymal abnormalities. The aim of this article is to summarize the most important clinical applications of the recent advances in imaging and to emphasize the topics of imaging research likely to attract particular attention from radiologists and clinicians in the near future.
