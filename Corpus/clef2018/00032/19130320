Correlation of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography maximal standardized uptake value and EGFR mutations in advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in lung adenocarcinoma are involved in the tumorigenesis and regulation of cell metabolism via Akt signaling. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG PET), a functional imaging modality, can be used to measure tumor cell metabolism. Thus, in this study, we hypothesize that there exist correlations between EGFR mutation status and [(18)F]FDG uptake of advanced lung adenocarcinoma.From May 2004 to April 2008, patients with stage IIIB or IV lung adenocarcinoma who underwent [(18)F]FDG PET and EGFR mutation analysis before receiving any treatment were eligible to participate in this study. The association of EGFR mutation status with patient characteristics and the SUV(MAX) from the [(18)F]FDG PET was evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze predictors of EGFR mutations.Seventy-seven lung adenocarcinoma patients were included in this study. EGFR mutations were identified in 49 (64%) of the patients. The [(18)F]FDG uptake was significantly higher in EGFR-mutant (mean SUV(MAX) = 10.5 +/- 4.7) than wild-type (8.0 +/- 3.3) lung adenocarcinoma patients (P = 0.008). The median SUV(MAX) was 9.5, and patients with an SUV(MAX) >or= 9.5 were more likely to harbor EGFR mutations (P = 0.009). In the multivariate analysis, an SUV(MAX) >or= 9.5 remained a statistically significant predictor of EGFR mutations (P = 0.005).Among Asian patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, those with higher SUV(MAX) on the [(18)F]FDG PET are more likely to carry EGFR mutations.
