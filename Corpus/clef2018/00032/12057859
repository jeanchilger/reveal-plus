Whole body FDG-PET for the evaluation and staging of small cell lung cancer: a preliminary study. [F18]-2-deoxy-2fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is increasingly used in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. Despite its positive performance characteristics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the role of FDG-PET in the staging of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains to be determined. We designed a prospective study to address this question. Eighteen patients with SCLC were enrolled prospectively to undergo total body FDG-PET in addition to conventional staging procedures (chest computed tomography (CT), abdominal CT, cranial CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scan/bone marrow biopsy). The agreement between FDG-PET and conventional staging modalities in identifying the presence or absence of metastatic disease was compared using the Veterans Administration (VA) cooperative staging system for staging. Overall staging by FDG-PET agreed with conventional staging exams in 15/18 (83%) patients (kappa=0.67), which included eight extensive and seven limited cases. FDG-PET showed more extensive disease in two of the three patients for which FDG-PET and conventional staging disagreed. These data suggest that total body FDG-PET may be useful in the staging, treatment planning, and prognostication of SCLC. Whether FDG-PET will replace other more established staging modalities remains to be determined by larger prospective randomized controlled studies.
