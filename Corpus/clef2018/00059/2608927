Cerebral blood flow imaging in patients with moyamoya disease. The usefulness of IMP-SPECT and rCBF image by 133Xe inhalation method on rCBF in patients with moyamoya disease was studied. Six patients with moyamoya disease were diagnosed by cerebral angiogram, and STA-MCA anastomosis technique and EMS were done to reconstruct the rCBF. Low perfusion areas were detected around the cerebral infarction and hemorrhage and that of anterior and middle cerebral arteries by IMP-SPECT and 133Xe-rCBF image met by X-ray CT. After surgery, 4 out of 6 cases showed the improvement of rCBF by IMP-SPECT and 133Xe-rCBF image, as for clinical symptoms, there were reduction of TIA in 3 cases, and no rehemorrhage in 3 cases. In summary IMP-SPECT and 133Xe-rCBF image may be useful method to evaluate the rCBF in moyamoya disease and the change of rCBF post STA-MCA anastomosis technique and EMS.
