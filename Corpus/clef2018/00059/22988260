Radiologist views of positron emission mammography. Early detection and diagnosis of malignant breast lesions are vital to survival. Although current imaging modalities such as mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging focus on an anatomic approach, they do not provide sufficient data about the pathophysiology of malignant breast lesions. Positron emission mammography (PEM) is an innovative technology specifically designed to visualize the physiologic and metabolic processes in malignant breast lesions, but it remains underused as a diagnostic tool.The purpose of this research is to provide quantitative and qualitative evidence from radiologists' perspective about the efficacy of physiologic imaging and the future implementation of PEM as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice.Radiologists were asked to complete a survey designed to elicit their perspective on the role of physiologic imaging in detecting and diagnosing breast cancer and on PEM as an adjunct modality.Based on the survey data, 66% of participants considered physiologic imaging to be beneficial because it provides additional diagnostic data, and 67% supported the future use of PEM as an adjunct to mammography.Although preliminary indications favor the use of adjunct PEM, further research is needed before it becomes a common clinical tool.
