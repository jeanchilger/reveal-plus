Small solid tumors (< or = 2 cm) of the pancreas: relative accuracy and differentiation of CT and MR imaging. To determine the relative accuracy of CT and MRI in characterization of solid pancreatic masses (< or = 2cm) and useful imaging appearance for differentiating small pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from other small solid pancreatic neoplasms.CT and MRI scans of 46 patients with evidence of small pancreatic solid tumor were retrospectively evaluated, who underwent CT (n=30), MRI (n=4), or both (n=12). Two gastrointestinal radiologists independently recorded specific morphological features of tumors and the most likely diagnosis.With respect to specific histopathological characterization, CT and MRI were equally accurate. The mean number of correct diagnoses made by the two reviewers was 37.5 (88.4%) of 42 cases for CT compared to 12 (75%) of 16 cases for MRI (p=0.388). Location in the pancreatic head (p=0.000), presence of dilatation of MPD (p=0.000), presence of dilatation of CBD (p=0.001) and enhancement pattern (p=0.000) were statistically significant for differentiating PDAC from the other small solid pancreatic tumors, while pancreatic atrophy (p=0.069) was statistically inadequate for differentiation, although it gave a 96.4% specificity for the diagnosis of PDAC.CT and MRI are similarly accurate in the characterization of small solid pancreatic tumors. Small PDAC has characteristic CT and MRI findings that differentiate it from other small solid tumors.
