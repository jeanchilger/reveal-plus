MRI of primary amyloidosis. In a patient with primary amyloidosis, we compared T2 values and relative signal intensity ratios of involved organs to those of normal patients. T2 was significantly decreased in the spleen and adrenals, while significantly increased in the pancreas. T2 values were insignificantly changed in the liver, subcutaneous fat, bone marrow, or kidney. Ratios may facilitate detection of relative changes in T2 values.
