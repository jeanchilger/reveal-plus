Acute pancreatitis associated with neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. Endocrine tumors are a less commonly known cause of acute pancreatitis. This report presents the case of a patient who have had acute pancreatitis secondary to a pancreatic endocrine neoplasm. The majority of the cases previously reported were non-functioning tumors and the pancreatitis tended to be mild. Moreover, the majority of the tumors were diagnosed in advanced stages, hindering curative treatment.A 31-year-old female patient presented with epigastric pain and a history of recurrent acute pancreatitis. Preoperative imaging investigation showed a dilation of the distal portion of the main pancreatic duct and intra-operative ultrasound demonstrated a mild stricture of the main pancreatic duct at the body of the pancreas. Frozen-section examination revealed a malignant neoplasm, subsequently identified as a neuroendocrine carcinoma, and a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. Acute pancreatitis was an early symptom in this patient who underwent a hopefully curative resection.The authors conclude that, in patients with acute pancreatitis of unknown origin, the possibility of a non-functioning neuroendocrine tumor should be investigated.
