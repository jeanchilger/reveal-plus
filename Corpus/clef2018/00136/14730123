Magnetic resonance imaging of acute pancreatitis: the pancreatogram. Acute pancreatitis has been reported in many cases after therapeutic ERCP.We report the case of a 65 year man old who, after ERCP, manifested biologically acute pancreatitis. The patient was observed using dynamic MR pancreatography with secretin administration before and after the ERCP. The dynamic MR pancreatography prominently displays a radiological sign of early chronic pancreatitis: the pancreatogram.Our case demonstrates a new sign of biologically acute pancreatitis in dynamic MR pancreatography: the pancreatogram.
