Isolated fat-containing pancreatic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a case of a 50-year-old male with isolated pancreatic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging detected the presence of fat, and which mimicked fatty replacement. A solitary metastatic pancreatic tumor originating from HCC is very rare. Furthermore, we believe that this is the first report of fat-containing pancreatic metastasis from HCC.
