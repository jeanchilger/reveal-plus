Uterine tissue development in healthy women during the normal menstrual cycle and investigations with magnetic resonance imaging. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to monitor both uterine endometrial and junctional zone morphometry during the normal menstrual cycle.Twenty-four healthy, ovulating women were studied during a single menstrual cycle. Three scans were performed to prospectively coincide with the follicular, periovulatory, and luteal phases of the cycle.MRI data showed a significant increase in endometrial and junctional zone volume, between the follicular and periovulatory phases, with a significant decrease in endometrial volume observed from the periovulatory to luteal phases. The regularity index, which is a novel subjective assessment of junctional zone structure, varied significantly and demonstrated a less regular junctional zone in the luteal phase.This study has quantified the normal developmental changes of uterine tissue during the menstrual cycle with MRI. Junctional zone data from MRI may play a major role in future studies that investigate menstrual disorders, subfertility, and pathologic changes.
