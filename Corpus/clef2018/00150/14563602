Endometrial cancer: what's new?. New and much debated data of the endometrial cancer concerning the preoperative assessment of myometrial invasion, the surgical staging, and the adjuvant treatment.Medline (1998-2002): searching for "endometrial carcinoma".The pap smears are useful when it is difficult to have a transvaginal ultrasonography or an MRI. We can perform the pap smears and the endometrial biopsy in the clinic. If a patient has pap smears with malignant cells or elevated preoperative CA 125, it probably is a cancer with poor prognostic factors. Surgical staging with abdominal and node evaluation is necessary. The MRI seems to be the best preoperative imaging because we have information about adnexal and abdominal metastases, pelvic or aortic nodes and the invasion of the myometrium. So it gives us information on the surgical route, and provides indication for a lymphadenectomy. The surgical staging is a part of the treatment of the endometrial cancer: an exploration of the peritoneal cavity, a pelvic lymphadenectomy, a para-aortic lymphadenectomy if the pelvic nodes are positive or if there are factors of bad prognosis (deep stage IC, grade 3, adnexal or abdominal involvement, serous carcinoma of the endometrium). It can be performed if technical conditions are correct. The adjuvant teletherapy in the documented stage IpN0 (surgical staging with pelvic lymphadenectomy) does not seem to be necessary. But we can perform an adjuvant brachytherapy (high-dose rate if it is possible) in patients with a high local recurrence (stage IC, stage I with grade 3, stage IB grade 2).The preoperative MRI is useful choosing the surgical approach, and the depth of the myometrial invasion, which can be an indication for a pelvic lymphadenectomy. The surgical staging must be a part of the treatment of the endometrial cancer. So the adjuvant teletherapy in patients with stage IpN0 documented should not be used.
