Evaluation of magnetic resonance colonography at 3.0 Tesla regarding diagnostic accuracy and image quality. To assess magnetic resonance (MR)-colonography (MRC) for detection of colorectal lesions using two different T1w three-dimensional (3D)-gradient-recalled echo (GRE)-sequences and integrated parallel data acquisition (iPAT) at a 3.0 Tesla MR-unit.In this prospective study, 34 symptomatic patients underwent dark lumen MRC at a 3.0 Tesla unit before conventional colonoscopy (CC). After colon distension with tap water, 2 high-resolution T1w 3D-GRE [3-dimensional fast low angle shot (3D-FLASH), iPAT factor 2 and 3D-volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE), iPAT 3] sequences were acquired without and after bolus injection of gadolinium. Prospective evaluation of MRC was performed. Image quality of the different sequences was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. The findings of the same day CC served as standard of reference.MRC identified all polyps >5 mm (16 of 16) in size and all carcinomas (4 of 4) correctly. Fifty percent of the small polyps </=5 mm (4 of 8) were visualized by MRC. Diagnostic quality was excellent in 94% (384 of 408 colonic segments) using the 3D-FLASH and in 92% (376 of 408) for the VIBE. The 3D-FLASH sequence showed a 3-fold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (8 +/- 3.3 standard deviation (SD) in lesions without contrast enhancement (CE) 24.3 +/- 7.8 SD after CE). For the 3D-VIBE sequence, signal-to-noise ratio doubled in the detected lesions (147 +/- 54 SD without and 292 +/- 168 SD after CE). Although image quality was ranked lower in the VIBE, the image quality score of both sequences showed no statistical significant difference (chi > 0.6).MRC using 3D-GRE-sequences and iPAT is feasible at 3.0 T-systems. The high-resolution 3D-FLASH was slightly preferred over the 3D-VIBE because of better image quality, although both used sequences showed no statistical significant difference.
