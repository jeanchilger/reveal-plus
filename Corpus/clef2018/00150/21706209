Uterus didelphys, hemihydrocolpos and empty ipsilateral lumbar fossa in a newborn girl: involuted dysplastic kidney rather than renal agenesis. We report a case of Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome diagnosed in the neonatal period. US revealed the classic association of a uterus didelphys with blind hemivagina and no ipsilateral kidney. The diagnosis was established by postnatal US and confirmed by MRI. Differential diagnoses are discussed. A trans-hymeneal resection of the vaginal septum was performed at 1 month of age. Intra operative endoscopy revealed no left hemitrigone but showed an atretic orifice in the ipsilateral blind hemivagina, probably corresponding to the insertion of an ectopic ureter. Follow-up was unremarkable.
