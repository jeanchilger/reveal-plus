The preoperative assessment of deep myometrial invasion by three-dimensional ultrasound versus MRI in endometrial carcinoma. To evaluate the usefulness of three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three-dimensional power Doppler angiography (3D-PDA) in the preoperative assessment of myometrial invasion in endometrial carcinoma.A prospective observational study.University hospital.Twenty consecutive patients diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma.Preoperative 3 T MRI and 3D US examinations were performed, and the depth of myometrial invasion was assessed. The vascularity indices, vascularization index, flow index and vascularization flow index, were calculated by 3D-PDA.The results were compared with the final histopathology report after a surgical staging.In detecting deep myometrial invasion, the sensitivity of 3D US, MRI and their combination was 50, 91.7 and 100%, respectively. The specificity was 87.5, 50 and 50%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the 3D-PDA vascularity indices between the two groups.MRI appears to be more sensitive than 3D US in detecting deep invasion, while 3D US has a better specificity.
