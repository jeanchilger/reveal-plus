The PRIDEH project: taking up privacy protection services in e-health. PRIDEH (Privacy Enhancement in Data Management in e-Health) is a project that runs for two years and is partly funded by the European Commission. The focus of PRIDEH is on the stimulation of the take-up of privacy enhancing technologies within the health domain. Privacy enhancing technologies build upon available cryptographic and communication technologies. The concept of privacy enhancing services delivery through the use of intermediary trusted third parties has already been described in literature but rarely turned into practice. A number of limited PET (Privacy Enhancing Technologies) applications exist in closed domains. The very few existing solutions are not based on an independent TTP (Trusted Third Party) concept which renders their trustworthiness questionable. PRIDEH wants to enhance the take-up of PET delivery based on sound TTP principles in the domain of healthcare.
