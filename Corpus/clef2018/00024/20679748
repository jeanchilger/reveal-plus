Comparative diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas. To compare the value of intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (US), intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas.The study enrolled 48 patients, aged between 20 and 79 years (35 [72.9%] women, 13 [27.1%] men mean age, 53.5+/-12.855 years), who were examined and treated in the Departments of Gastroenterology, Surgery, and Oncology, Hospital of Kaunas University of Medicine, in the year 2007. All patients underwent intravenous contrast-enhanced US, intravenous contrast-enhanced CT, and MRI and were diagnosed with hepatic hemangioma according to the findings of these examinations.The size of hemangiomas was < or =2.0 cm in 20 cases (41.7%) and >2.0 cm in 28 (58.3%). No association between hepatic hemangioma and patient's age was found (chi(2)=0.547, df=2, P=0.761). Nearly one-third of hemangiomas were located in the segment IV of the left hepatic lobe. There were a few complicated hemangiomas in the study sample: 2 with calcification and 1 with necrosis. The sensitivity of CT in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma was 76.92% specificity, 33.3%Intravenous contrast-enhanced US is more specific than intravenous contrast-enhanced CT in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma (P=0.0005) and has a higher positive prognostic value (P=0.001).
