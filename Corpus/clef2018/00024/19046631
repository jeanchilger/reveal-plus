Follow-up with 18FDG-PET-CT after radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy allows the detection of potentially curable progressive disease in non-small cell lung cancer patients: a prospective study. Follow-up of patients treated with curative intent for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with X-ray or CT-scans is of unproven value. Furthermore, most patients with progressive disease present with symptoms outside of follow-up visits. Because the accuracy of (18)FDG-PET-CT is superior to CT, we hypothesised that FDG-PET-CT scans 3 months post-treatment could lead to early detection of progressive disease (PD) amenable for radical treatment.Hundred patients with NSCLC, treated with curative intent with (chemo) radiation, were prospectively evaluated. All patients underwent a planned FDG-PET-CT scan 3 months after the start of radiotherapy.Twenty four patients had PD 3 months post-treatment. 16/24 patients were symptomatic. No curative treatment could be offered to any of these patients. In 3/8 asymptomatic patients progression, potentially amenable for radical therapy was found, which were all detected with PET, not with CT only.PET-scanning after curative treatment for NSCLC led to the detection of progression potentially amenable for radical treatment in a small proportion (3%) of patients. Selectively offering a PET-CT scan to the patient group without symptoms could possibly lead to an effective follow-up method.
