Receptor-binding ability of fragments 260-600 and 397-796 of SARS-associated coronavirus spike protein. To investigate the interaction between the host cell and the truncated S fragments to identify the receptor-binding domain of the spike (S) protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).Two different fragments S260-600 and S397-796 of the SARS-CoV S protein were expressed in Escherichia coli (E.coli) using a pET expression vector, respectively. The two recombinant proteins were separately verified by Western blot, purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, and incubated with Vero cells, a susceptible cell line of SARS-CoV infection, for cell binding assay. After the sequential probing with sera from convalescent SARS-patients and FITC-labeled anti-human IgG, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The NIH 3T3 cell, a non-permissive cell line of SARS-CoV infection, was used as controls.The recombinant proteins S260-600 and S397-796 were efficiently expressed in an insoluble form in E.coli. The appropriate expression of the proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using both SARS patients' sera and anti-6 x histidine antibody. The flow cytometry results showed that the both proteins were able to bind Vero cells, but the binding ability of S260-600 was somewhat stronger than that of S397-796. In contrast, the S260-600 protein did not bind NIH3T3 cells.Both S260-600 and S397-796 exhibited different receptor binding activity. The S260-600 fragment probably contains the important receptor binding domain and could be a potential candidate for the development of SARS vaccine and anti-SARS therapeutics.
