Clinical assessment of therapeutic effects on cancer using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and positron emission tomography: preliminary study of lung cancer. Using positron emission tomography, we studied the tumor uptake of 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) in five lung cancer patients before and after anti-cancer therapy (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). The tumor uptake of 18FDG was classified as positive and negative the former, by increasing the uptake of 18FDG with time, and the latter, by decreasing or the constant uptake of 18FDG. Before therapy, all cases tested positive. After therapy, three cases were negative and two cases remained positive. All negative cases corresponded to complete second 18FDG study. Our findings in the 18FDG study correlate with the clinical results. 18FDG is a promising method for assessing therapeutic effects on cancer clinically.
