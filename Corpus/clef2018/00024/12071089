Barrett esophagus--esophageal carcinoma: diagnosis. The Barrett esophagus as the premalignent lesion for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction is of widespread interest. Endoscopy and histology are the diagnostic basis. Methylen blue staining and high-resolution endoscopes facilitate the diagnosis of Barrett esophagus. Use of a high resolution endoluminal ultrasound probe and optical coherence tomography are new methods for evaluating the local depth invasion of the Barrett mucosa. Accurate pretherapy staging for esophageal carcinoma is important for a stage--directed therapy. After endoscopy and histology the endoscopic ultrasound is the method of choice for local regional staging of esophageal carcinoma. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography were shown to be especially useful in detection of distant metastases.
