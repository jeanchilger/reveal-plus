Current state of imaging for lung cancer staging. Proper selection and interpretation of imaging studies is essential to provide optimal treatment to patients who have lung cancer. The following combines the recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians [74] and the authors' current clinical practice guidelines: --All patients who have known or suspected lung cancer should undergo a CT of the chest and upper abdomen. --An FDG-PET study should be performed, if available. --Mediastinoscopy should be performed in all patients except those who have peripheral small (<2 cm) tumors and no evidence of N2 disease on CT or PET imaging. --MRI should be performed for tumors of the superior sulcus to define the relationship of the tumor to adjacent neurovascular structures. --Patients who have neurologic signs or symptoms should undergo a brain imaging study (CT or MRI). --Screening for extrathoracic disease is not necessary in asymptomatic patients who have clinical stage I or II disease.
