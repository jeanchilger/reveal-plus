Progress in bronchoscopy: ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). In case of lung cancer, evaluation of the extension disease is mandatory. Mediastinal nodes must also be evaluated: if a controlateral to the tumor node is metastatic (N3), surgery is no more indicated. As specificity of PET-CT scan is not satisfaying (78%), cytology or histology of a suspect node is necessary. Even if PT-CT scan is negative, node micrometastasis are not excluded. To investigate a mediastinal adenopathy, mediastinoscopy or mediastinotomy are gold standard. Cytoponction guided by ultrasonography (EBUS-TBNA) is a new method which has been proved to be efficient and safe, but necessating some expertise and regular practice. It could be a valuable alternative to mediastinoscopy.
