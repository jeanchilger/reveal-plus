Uptake of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-[U-14C]-glucose during chemotherapy in murine Lewis lung tumor. Mice bearing intramuscular Lewis lung tumor were treated with BCNU and doxorubicin (ADM) to study chemotherapy-induced changes in the uptake of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-[U-14C]glucose (FDG). A decreased FDG uptake, tumor regression and a diminished proportion of aneuploid versus diploid cells as evaluated by DNA flow cytometry were seen after treatment with BCNU but not with ADM HPLC indicated that most of the 14C activity in tumors was from FDG6-phosphate. The results suggest that changes in FDG uptake reflect the effectiveness of antitumor therapy. FDG may be valuable in follow-up studies of cancer treatment.
