Usefulness of 99mTc-Technegas and 133Xe dynamic SPECT in ventilatory impairment. To assess the usefulness of SPECT images using (99m)Tc-Technegas (Technegas) and (133)Xe dynamic single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (Xe gas) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), as compared with pathological assessment in the detection of small-airway disease including pulmonary emphysema.Seventeen patients with lung cancer were studied. All patients who had undergone both Technegas and Xe gas and CT prior to surgery were examined. SPECT and HRCT results were compared with the results of pathological findings. Histopathological analysis was performed in an area distant from cancer in lobectomy specimens obtained at surgery. Pathological analysis was performed in relation to bronchitis, bronchiolitis, fibrosis of the alveoli and disruption in walls of the alveoli.Pathological abnormality (mild-to-moderate abnormal change) was seen in all 17 cases. Three patients showed low attenuation areas on CT, and abnormal patterns in SPECT images. In 11 of 14 patients who showed normal findings on CT, SPECT imaging depicted abnormal findings. The remaining three patients had no abnormal findings on CT and both SPECT imaging.Technegas and (133)Xe SPECT imaging is useful for evaluating small-airway disease including pulmonary emphysema. Furthermore, SPECT imaging is more useful than morphological HRCT imaging in the evaluation of small-airway disease including pulmonary emphysema.
