Metabolic imaging in the diagnosis of brain tumors. Positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy provide distinct, uncorrelated and sensitive indicators of brain tumors which can be used to improve differential diagnosis, biopsy guidance or therapy monitoring. New findings, including conflicting ethyl-cysteinate-dimer/hexamethyl-propyleneamineoxide uptake in single photon emission computed tomography and increased lipids and macromolecules in magnetic resonance spectroscopy, may provide new tools for the investigation of clinical tumors.
