Dynamic pulmonary SPECT of xenon-133 gas washout. A triple-detector SPECT data acquisition mode of "continuous repetitive rotation acquisition" was applied to dynamic pulmonary SPECT with 133Xe gas.Subjects included 7 healthy volunteers, 22 patients with a space-occupying mass lesion, 22 with obstructive lung disease and 10 with restrictive lung disease. Following rebreathing of 133Xe, equilibrium and washout SPECT images during spontaneous breathing were acquired every 30 sec for 5-7 min. Regional 133Xe washout was assessed by the real half-time (T1/2) and mean transit time (MTT) images.SPECT and MTT images represented a gravity-induced gradient of ventilation in normal lungs and detailed the distribution of heterogeneous 133Xe washout in patient's lungs with or without abnormalities on chest x-ray CT. The T1/2 (111.4 +/- 26.4 sec) and its coefficient of variation (0.36 +/- 0.13) in obstructive lung diseases were significantly different from those (56.8 +/- 3.9 sec and 0.16 +/- 0.15) in restrictive lung diseases (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively). Comparison of SPECT and planar studies assessed in 19 patients revealed superiority of SPECT in detecting ventilatory abnormalities and a high correlation of T1/2 between the two studies ( r= 0.977, p < 0.001).This modality has excellent potential for elucidating the distribution and nature of ventilatory abnormalities.
