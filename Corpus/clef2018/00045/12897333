Docetaxel-based combined-modality chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The cytotoxic agent docetaxel not only has proven activity in non-small cell lung cancer-when used alone or in combination-but is also a potent radiosensitizer, and improved treatments are needed in all stages of this disease. In patients with locoregionally advanced (stage III) disease, docetaxel has shown efficacy with manageable toxicities when used alone or in combination with a platinum compound in a sequential manner before localized radical radiotherapy/surgery. Presently, therapeutic gains appear to be maximized by the use of concurrent chemotherapy and irradiation. This review focuses on research with combinations of docetaxel with either cisplatin or carboplatin and radiotherapy. Overall response and survival rates to date provide data worth pursuing. From phase I data, weekly docetaxel at 20 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin at 25 mg/m(2) or carboplatin to an area under the concentration time curve of 2 mg/ml*min with concurrent radiotherapy to 60 Gy over 6 weeks appear to be suitable for phase II trials. Predominant toxicities are esophagitis and neutropenia, but a low frequency of pulmonary toxicity is reported. Induction, concurrent, and consolidation docetaxel-based chemoradiotherapy in potentially resectable disease are all being investigated. Future research could include the investigation of computed tomography/ positron emission tomography-derived target volume radiotherapy, dose-escalated therapy, and alternative fractionation schedules in combination with docetaxel-based cytotoxic chemotherapy.
