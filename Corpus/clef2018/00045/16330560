A 18F-MPPF PET normative database of 5-HT1A receptor binding in men and women over aging. Neurotransmission imaging studies require normative data for the statistical assessment of neurophysiologic dysfunctions. 2'-Methoxyphenyl-(N-2'-pyridinyl)-p-18F-fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine (18F-MPPF) is a specific serotonin 5-HT1A antagonist PET tracer recently characterized, modeled, and used for clinical research to explore abnormalities in the serotoninergic system. Our study reports, to our knowledge, the first large normative imaging database of 18F-MPPF binding potential (BP) over aging, for both males and females.Fifty-three healthy volunteers (27 females, 26 males age, 20-70 y) were selected to undergo structural MRI and single-injection 18F-MPPF multiframe dynamic PET. 18F-MPPF BP values were computed using a nonlinear modeling method with tissue reference. The statistical assessment of the effect of age and sex was performed both at the anatomic structure level, using regions of interest drawn manually on individual MR images, and at the voxel level, using normalized BP parametric images in different statistical parametric mapping designs.A negative linear correlation between age and 18F-MPPF binding (3.6% decrease by decade) was found in females but not in males and involved most of the limbic and paralimbic regions on the other hand, males in their 30s showed decreased binding in most cerebral regions.A comparison of males and females revealed higher BP values independent of age in females in the right hemisphere and a different evolution of BP over aging. These results confirm the necessity of a database for further statistical analysis in individuals or groups with pathology.
