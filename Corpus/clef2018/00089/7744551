Visual evoked potentials in Alzheimer's disease: investigations in a PET-defined collective. Intravital diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based clinical and neuropsychological findings alone does not allow sufficient differentiation from other disorders such as vascular dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) secures intravital diagnosis with high accuracy by determination of a typical metabolic pattern. Numerous publications have proposed visual evoked potentials (VEP) for the detection of AD. In a collective of 15 patients with probable AD according to NINCDS/ADRDA criteria and the typical metabolic pattern of AD, we examined pattern reversal and flash VEPs. The results were compared to those of an age-matched collective of patients without impairment of memory. Neither pattern reversal nor flash VEP were correlated to severity of dementia as determined by the mini-mental status examination (MMSE). The positive results of other investigators are probably due to different patient selection criteria which do not include findings of cerebral glucose metabolism in the definition of AD.
