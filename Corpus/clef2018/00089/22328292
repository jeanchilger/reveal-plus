Single-step purification and characterization of recombinant aspartase of Aeromonas media NFB-5. Aspartase (L-aspartate ammonia-lyase EC 4.3.1.1) catalyzes the reversible amination of fumaric acid to produce L-aspartic acid. Aspartase coding gene (aspA) of Aeromonas media NFB-5 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed with His tag using pET-21b⁺ expression vector in Escherichia coli BL21. Higher expression was obtained with IPTG (1.5 mM) induction for 5 h at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 0.3% K₂HPO₄ and 0.3% KH₂PO₄. Recombinant His tagged aspartase was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and characterized for various biochemical and kinetic parameters. The purified aspartase showed optimal activity at pH 8.5 and 8.0 in the presence and absence of magnesium ions, respectively. The optimum temperature was determined to be 35 °C. The enzyme showed apparent K(m) and V(max) values for L-aspartate as 2.01 mM and 114 U/mg, respectively. The enzyme was stable in pH range of 6.5-9.5 and temperature up to 45 °C. Divalent metal ion requirement of enzyme was efficiently fulfilled by Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺, and Ca²⁺ ions. The cloned gene (aspA) product showed molecular weight of approximately 51 kDa by SDS-PAGE, which is in agreement with the molecular weight calculated from putative amino acid sequence. This is the first report on expression and characterization of recombinant aspartase from A. media.
