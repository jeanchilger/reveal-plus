Challenge by the murine brain: multi-pinhole SPECT of 123I-labelled pharmaceuticals. This protocol presents an improved method for SPECT imaging based on multi-pinhole techniques, applied to the visualisation of neurotracers in small animal models. Three types of collimators with 6-pinhole apertures adapted to special requirements for the imaging of the brain of mice and rats and to full body imaging in mice are employed in the experiments. A conventional triple-headed TRIAD/Trionix SPECT system was upgraded with pyramidal supports and shieldings onto the multi-pinhole collimators were installed. The system was employed for the assessment of the uptake of [123I]FP-CIT and [123I]IBZM, well known tracers of dopamine transport and dopamine D2/D3 receptors, respectively. Requirements regarding the applied radioactivity are reported, as well as further conditions determining the effectiveness of the detection of the uptake of [123I]FP-CIT and [123I]IBZM. The measurements in mice required only 20-25% of the activity described in previous studies. Dynamic measurements are presented, with a time resolution as high as 10 min in the brain of rats. Due to the lower signal intensity obtained for mice, the time resolution was 42min for [123I]FP-CIT, with a ratio ROI/background of 5.4, and 17 min for [123I]IBZM, with the ratio ROI/background of 4.5 (1.6-7.4).
