Quantitative evaluation of L-[methyl-C-11] methionine uptake in tumor using positron emission tomography. Tumor uptake of L-[methyl-11C]methionine ([11C]Met) was assessed in six patients with brain tumors and three patients with lung cancer using positron emission tomography (PET). In arterial plasma samples taken at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min after injection, a fraction of [11C]Met was measured using high performance liquid chromatography in individual patients. Employing curve fitting, a history of [11C]Met activity was obtained as an input function. By means of sequential PET scannings and graphic analysis, uptake rate and distribution volume of [11C]Met in tumor tissue were calculated. In two studies irreversible uptake into the tumors was not seen when total plasma 11C activity was used as the input however when [11C]Met plasma activity was used, definite irreversible uptake was seen, indicating tumor viability. In other studies, up to 24% underestimation of uptake rate was found. The present results demonstrated the importance of measuring [11C]Met in plasma for quantitative assessment of in vivo amino acid metabolism in tumors.
