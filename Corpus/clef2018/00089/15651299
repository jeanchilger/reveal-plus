Cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias: diagnosis and treatment. Cluster headaches are characterized by strictly unilateral paroxysmal attacks of severe pain with associated autonomic sign and symptom. Prevalence is 5 times higher in men than in women in our cases. About 10-15% of patients have chronic symptoms without remissions, but we estimated less frequent in Japanese (6.6% in our series). Pain almost invariably recurs on the same side, but in some patients (16.4%) the affected site switches. Cluster headache may be inherited in about 5% of our cases. Attacks frequently occur at night (60.7%). The patients (64.8%) are restless or agitated during an attack. Recent PET studies elucidated that acute attacks causes activation of the posterior hypothalamic grey matter. The excitement of the area might be responsible for peculiar clinical characteristics of agitation. Some patients (66.0%) have also have symptoms (especially a visual aura) usually attributed to migraine. Treatment of cluster headache includes both acute therapy aimed at aborting individual attacks and prophylactic therapy aimed at preventing recurrent attacks during the cluster period. There are many choices using for both therapies. Based on our clinical experience, we recommended the combination of nasal sumatriptan for acute attacks and verapamil 240 mg/day for prophylaxis.
