Early and delayed single photon emission CT in various cerebral diseases using N-isopropyl-p-(123I)iodoamphetamine. Early and delayed single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using N-isopropyl-p-(123I)iodoamphetamine (IMP) was performed on 28 subjects (2 normal, 12 with cerebrovascular diseases and 14 with brain tumors) to evaluate the reversibility of the cerebral abnormality and cerebral viability. The results were compared with X-ray CT, 99mTc brain scintigraphy and rCBF by 133Xe inhalation method. Three types of IMP kinetics were observed. Initial hypoactivity that changed over 4 to 6 hours approaching a normal pattern suggests a hypofunctional parenchyma without significant tissue damage: long-lasting abnormalities on IMP SPECT indicates cellular damage.
