Comparison of MRI and ¹⁸F-NaF PET/CT in patients with patellofemoral pain. To determine whether bone metabolic activity corresponds to bone and cartilage damage in patients with patellofemoral pain.We acquired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and (18) F-NaF positron emission tomography (PET) / computed tomography (CT) scans of the knees of 22 subjects. We compared locations of increased tracer uptake on the (18) F-NaF PET images to bone marrow edema and cartilage damage visualized on MRI.We found that increased bone activity on (18) F-NaF PET does not always correspond to structural damage in the bone or cartilage as seen on MRI.Our results suggest that (18) F-NaF PET/CT may provide additional information in patellofemoral pain patients compared to MRI.
