An evaluation of human papillomavirus testing for intermediate- and high-risk types as triage before colposcopy. Our purpose was to evaluate the role of testing for intermediate- and high-risk human papillomavirus by use of a hybrid capture technique for predicting which patients with abnormal Papanicolaou smears are most likely to have squamous intraepithelial lesions or cancer.Cervical cytologic studies, hybrid capture tests, and colposcopically directed biopsies were performed on 311 women referred to the colposcopy clinics with abnormal cytologic study results.There was a highly significant correlation (p < 0.0001) between a positive human papillomavirus test and the finding of squamous intraepithelial lesions or invasive cancer. The sensitivity of human papillomavirus testing to detect high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions was 74% when it was used alone and increased to 91% when coupled with abnormal cytologic study results of low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or cancer. In 44 women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance on cytologic study, human papillomavirus testing identified six of 10 who had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. For the 96 patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, human papillomavirus testing was successful in identifying 29 of the 37 with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (sensitivity 0.76).Testing for intermediate- and high-risk human papillomavirus types by hybrid capture improves the detection of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions over cytologic study used alone.
