A multiple primer pairs polymerase chain reaction for the detection of human genital papillomavirus types. We describe a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the simultaneous detection of multiple strains of papillomavirus in a single reaction tube. This PCR method was specific and sensitive. We have validated this multiplex procedure on a collection of typed cervical biopsies specimens, and applied it to the detection of viruses in some clinical samples.
