Human papillomavirus vaccination in female pediatric cancer survivors. Survivors of childhood malignancy may be at increased risk for HPV infection for biological and cognitive/behavioral reasons. HPV vaccination is currently recommended for females 11-12 years old with catch up vaccination up to age 26 years. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of HPV vaccination among female pediatric cancer survivors, age 11-18 years, at Texas Children's Hospital. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 42-question survey was distributed to parents/guardians of 172 long-term cancer survivors from August-November of 2010. Data were analyzed using frequencies, t-tests, and chi-square analyses.Prevalence of HPV vaccination (intention and completion).Sixty-six persons (38%) responded. The median current age of survivors was 14 years. Most were white/non-Hispanic (48%) or white/Hispanic (37%). Seventy-one percent had discussed HPV vaccination with a healthcare provider. The overall rate of HPV vaccination (≥ 1 dose) was 32%, including 5% of those age 11-12 years (n = 1 of 21), 36% of those age 13-17 years (n = 13 of 36), and 78% of those age 18 years (n = 7 of 9). Of those whose children had not been immunized, 36% intended to do so in the future. Factors associated with HPV vaccination included age ≥13 years, report of sexual activity, and report of having discussed HPV vaccination with a healthcare provider.The rate of HPV vaccination among female pediatric cancer survivors is not appreciably different than that seen in the general population.
