Stereotactic body radiation therapy for locally recurrent, previously irradiated nonsquamous cell cancers of the head and neck. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a promising salvage strategy for patients with recurrent, previously irradiated head and neck cancer however, data are limited predominantly to squamous cell carcinomas. Herein, we report the efficacy of SBRT in recurrent, nonsquamous cell cancers of the head and neck (NSCHNs).In all, 34 patients with pathologically proven NSCHN were re-irradiated with SBRT to a median dose of 40 Gy in 5 fractions (interquartile range, 30-44 Gy). Toxicity and quality of life were followed prospectively.Median follow-up was 10 months (absolute range, 0-55 months). The 6-month/1-year local control rate was 77/59%, with a 6-month/1-year overall survival of 76/59%. Local control was significantly improved for tumors <25 mL (p = .030). Acute/late grade 3 toxicity was 15/6%, with no grade 4-5 toxicity.SBRT for previously irradiated, locally recurrent NSCHN provides promising local control, especially for tumors <25 mL, with minimal toxicity. The optimal dose for larger tumors remains to be defined.
