Efficacy of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans in diagnosis of pulmonary nodules. To evaluate the value of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans, we performed FDG-PET scans in 23 patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules less than 3 cm in size and analyzed these scans qualitatively and semiquantitatively. Histologic specimens were obtained by thoracoscopic excisional biopsy in 16 patients, CT-guided needle aspiration cytology in three, and bronchoscopic brushing cytology in four. Pathological diagnoses were lung cancer in 16 patients, benign inflammation in six, and malignant lymphoma in one. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the FDG-PET scans were 88% (15/17), 67% (4/6) and 83% (19/23), respectively. There were two false-positive cases (organizing pneumonia and cryptococcosis) and two false-negative ones (slow-growing adenocarcinoma and malignant lymphoma). Although a few false-positive cases of granulomatous disease were yielded, the FDG-PET scans were highly sensitive in the detection of lung cancer. We conclude that the FDG-PET scanning in a useful diagnostic imaging modailty in the management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules.
