Image-guided, tumor stroma-targeted 131I therapy of hepatocellular cancer after systemic mesenchymal stem cell-mediated NIS gene delivery. Due to its dual role as reporter and therapy gene, the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) allows noninvasive imaging of functional NIS expression by (123)I-scintigraphy or (124)I-PET imaging before the application of a therapeutic dose of (131)I. NIS expression provides a novel mechanism for the evaluation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as gene delivery vehicles for tumor therapy. In the current study, we stably transfected bone marrow-derived CD34(-) MSCs with NIS cDNA (NIS-MSC), which revealed high levels of functional NIS protein expression. In mixed populations of NIS-MSCs and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cells, clonogenic assays showed a 55% reduction of HCC cell survival after (131)I application. We then investigated body distribution of NIS-MSCs by (123)I-scintigraphy and (124)I-PET imaging following intravenous (i.v.) injection of NIS-MSCs in a HCC xenograft mouse model demonstrating active MSC recruitment into the tumor stroma which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and ex vivo γ-counter analysis. Three cycles of systemic MSC-mediated NIS gene delivery followed by (131)I application resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth. Our results demonstrate tumor-specific accumulation and therapeutic efficacy of radioiodine after MSC-mediated NIS gene delivery in HCC tumors, opening the prospect of NIS-mediated radionuclide therapy of metastatic cancer using MSCs as gene delivery vehicles.
