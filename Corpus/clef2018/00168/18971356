Occurrence, distribution, and origins of Streptococcus pneumoniae Serotype 6C, a recently recognized serotype. The prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6C, a recently recognized serotype that cross-reacts serologically with serotype 6A, was investigated. Isolates of serotype 6A in various collections were recovered, and serotype 6C was differentiated from 6A by multiplex PCR of DNA extracts by using appropriate primers. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution, and selected isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, repetitive sequence-based PCR typing, and rapid multilocus sequence typing (MLST) by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of PCR products. A total of 60 serotype 6C isolates were found: 30 of 122 Cleveland isolates collected from 1979 to 2007, 19 of 39 pediatric isolates collected nationwide in 2005 and 2006, and 11 pediatric isolates from Massachusetts collected in 2006 and 2007. Only four isolates were recovered prior to introduction of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in 2000 the earliest isolate was recovered in 1989. The sources of the isolates included blood (n = 5), the lower respiratory tract (n = 27), the sinus (n = 5), the ear (n = 2), and the nasopharynx (n = 18)
