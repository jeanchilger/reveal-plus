Significance of methicillin-teicoplanin resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus in bloodstream infections in patients of the Semmelweis University hospitals in Hungary. The purpose of this study was to quantify the impact of Staphylococcus haemolyticus in the epidemiology of the blood stream infection (BSI) and to characterize the rates and quantitative levels of resistance to antistaphylococcal drugs. During an eight-year period, 2967 BSIs of the patients hospitalized in different clinical departments of the Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary were analyzed. One hundred eighty-four were caused by S. haemolyticus, amounting to 6% of all infections. The antibacterial resistance of S. haemolyticus isolates was investigated by the broth microdilution method, vancomycin agar screen, population analysis profile and PCR for mecA, vanA and vanB genes detection. Epidemiological investigation was processed by determining phenotypic antibiotic resistance patterns and PFGE profiles. Extremely high MIC levels of resistance were obtained to oxacillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. The incidence of teicoplanin reduced susceptibility revealed 32% without possessing either the vanA or vanB gene by the strains. PFGE revealed 56 well-defined genotypes indicating no clonal relationship of the strains. The propensity of S. haemolyticus to acquire resistance and its pathogenic potential in immunocompromised patients, especially among preterm neonates, emphasise the importance of species level identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci and routinely determine the MIC of proper antibacterial agents for these isolates.
