Characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Salmonella enterica serotype Brunei and Heidelberg at the Hussein Dey hospital in Algiers (Algeria). The purpose of this work was to study the genetic determinants responsible for extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC) resistance of Salmonella collected during the period of 1995-2008 at the Hussein Dey hospital in Algiers (Algeria). Fourteen ESC-resistant Salmonella isolates were tested towards 22 antimicrobial agents. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were used to determine the underlying genetic determinants responsible for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes. Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus PCR was employed to type the isolates. All tested isolates were resistant to ticarcillin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, piperacillin, cefuroxime, aztreonam, ceftazidime, cefotaxime (except two isolates), cefepime, and cefpirome. PCR and DNA sequencing identified these ESBLs as TEM-48 (n=6), TEM-4 (n=3), CTX-M-15 (n=4), and one new TEM, designated TEM-188. Thus, continued surveillance for the presence of ESBL-producing (non-typhoidal) salmonellae in Algeria is essential.
