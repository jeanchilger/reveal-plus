Hypermutable Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic fibrosis patients from two Brazilian cities. Hypermutable (HPM) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found at high frequencies in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in Europe. We report the results of testing for HPM frequencies, mutator genotype, and antimicrobial resistance of P. aeruginosa strains from Brazilian CF patients. A modified disk diffusion technique was used to quantify antibiotic-resistant subpopulations of an isolate, and estimations of the frequency of mutation to rifampin resistance were determined for 705 isolates from 149 patients attending clinics in two Brazilian cities. Mutations in the mutS gene were detected by sequencing assays. We found 194 (27.5%) HPM isolates in samples from 99 (66.4%) patients. Thirty-five HPM isolates (18.0%) from 31 (31.3%) patients exhibited a high increased spontaneous mutation rate compared with controls, and eight isolates from six patients displayed a defective mutS gene. The dominant HPM population was associated with very low antibiotic resistance levels, while HPM subpopulations were generally more resistant to antimicrobials. A relatively high prevalence of HPM P. aeruginosa in CF patients was associated with surprisingly low antibiotic resistance levels, in contrast to some earlier studies.
