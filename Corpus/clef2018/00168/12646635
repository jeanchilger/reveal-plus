Conservation of nonpeptide antigen recognition by rhesus monkey V gamma 2V delta 2 T cells. We have previously found that monkey Vgamma2Vdelta2(+) T cells mount adaptive immune responses in response to Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin infections. We have now analyzed rhesus monkey gammadelta T cell responses to nonpeptide Ags and superantigens. Like human Vgamma2Vdelta2(+) T cells, rhesus monkey gammadelta T cells are stimulated when exposed to prenyl pyrophosphate, bisphosphonate, and alkylamine Ags. Responsiveness was limited to gammadelta T cells expressing Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCRs. Rhesus monkey Vgamma2Vdelta2(+) T cells also responded to the superantigen, staphyloccocal enterotoxin A. Sequencing of the rhesus monkey Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCR revealed a strong sequence homology to human Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCR that preserves important sequence motifs. Moreover, chimeric TCRs that pair human Vgamma2 with monkey Vdelta2 and monkey Vgamma2 with human Vdelta2 retain reactivity to nonpeptide Ags and B cell lymphomas. A molecular model of the rhesus monkey Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCR has a basic region in the complementarity-determining region 3 binding groove that is similar to that seen in the human Vgamma2Vdelta2 TCR and preserves the topology of the complementarity-determining region loops. Thus, recognition of nonpeptide prenyl pyrophosphate, bisphosphonate, and alkylamine Ags is conserved in primates suggesting that primates can provide an animal model for human gammadelta T cell Ag responses.
