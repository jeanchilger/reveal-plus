The isolation of Corynebacterium coyleae from clinical samples: clinical and microbiological data. Fourteen Corynebacterium coyleae isolates were recovered from 12 in-patients during a 5-years period. In six patients, the isolates were considered as clinically significant, three definite (sepsis), two probable (sepsis and soft tissue infection), and one possible (post-transfusional bacteremia). In the remaining 6 patients (all neonatal bacteremias), there was not enough data for considering the isolates as clinical significant. API Coryne identified all isolates as C. jeikeium, while Biolog GP2 correctly identified 7 out of the 14 isolates. Definitive identification was achieved in all isolates by the sequencing of a fragment of 724 to 1423 pb of 16S rDNA. Successive isolations from two patients presented identical random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles. All of the isolates were in-vitro-sensitive to beta-lactams, gentamicin, rifampin, tetracycline, vancomycin, linezolid, and resistant to clindamycin. Resistance to erythromycin occurred in 83.3% of isolates, all of them presenting phenotype cMLS and harboring the gene ermX.
