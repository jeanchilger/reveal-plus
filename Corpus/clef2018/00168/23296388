Prevalence of human metapneumovirus in children with acute lower respiratory infection in Changsha, China. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes acute respiratory infections in children. The prevalence and clinical characteristics of hMPV were determined in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children in Changsha, China. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen for both hMPV and other common respiratory viruses in 1,165 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from children with lower respiratory tract infections from September 2007 to August 2008. All PCR products were sequenced, and demographic and clinical data were collected from all patients. Seventy-six of 1,165 (6.5%) specimens were positive for hMPV, of which 85.5% (65/76) occurred in the winter and spring seasons. The hMPV coinfection rate was 57.9% (44/76), and human bocavirus was the most common virus detected in conjunction with hMPV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 94.7% of the hMPV detected were of subgroup A2, 5.3% were subgroup B2, and none belonged to either the A1 or B1 subgroups. No significant differences were found in terms of the frequency of diagnosis and clinical signs between either the co- and mono-infection groups, or between patients with and without underlying diseases. It was concluded that hMPV is an important viral pathogen in pediatric patients with lower respiratory tract infections in Changsha. Only hMPV genotypes A2 and B2 were co-circulating in this locality human bocavirus was the most common coinfecting virus, and coinfection did not affect disease severity.
