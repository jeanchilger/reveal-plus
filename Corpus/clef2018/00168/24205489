Macrolide resistance of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and its detection rate by real-time PCR in primary and tertiary care hospitals. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in primary and tertiary care hospitals and its macrolide resistance rate.Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 195 pediatric patients in primary and tertiary care hospitals from October to November 2010. The AccuPower MP real-time PCR kit (Bioneer, Korea) was used for the detection of M. pneumoniae. Direct amplicon sequencing was performed to detect point mutations conferring resistance to macrolides in the 23S rRNA gene.Among the 195 specimens, 17 (8.7%) were M. pneumoniae positive, and 3 of the strains (17.6%) obtained from these 17 specimens displayed the A2063G mutation in 23S rRNA. Three macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae isolates were isolated from patients hospitalized at the primary care hospital. The positive rates of M. pneumoniae for the primary and tertiary care hospitals were 12.1% (15/124) and 2.8% (2/71), respectively (P=0.033).The positive rate of M. pneumoniae in the primary care hospital was higher than that in the tertiary care hospital. Simultaneous detection of M. pneumoniae and macrolide-resistant mutation genes in the 23S rRNA by real-time PCR is needed for rapid diagnosis and therapy of M. pneumoniae infections.
