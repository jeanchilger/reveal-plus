Molecular diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. Several molecular testing options are now or will soon be available for diagnosing bloodstream infections in the neonate. The advantages include the speed at which results would be available and the ability to use those results to tailor empirical therapy and reduce the amount of unnecessary or ineffective antibiotics an infant receives. However, there are still difficult challenges before this potential can be realized. A variety of technological advances are needed, including (1) improved recovery of microorganisms in whole blood extractions, (2) increased assay sensitivity, (3) simpler testing platforms that could be run 24/7, and (4) more assays to detect antibiotic resistance genes to reduce reliance on culture-based protocols for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Although considerable hurdles remain, this challenge is now a priority for investigators in academia and industry.
