New molecular techniques for chromosome analysis. The advent of molecular genetic technology has significantly advanced knowledge about the structure of chromosomes and their behaviour during meiosis and mitosis, as well as delineating cytogenetic aberrations that cannot be identified by conventional chromosome analysis. Molecular cytogenetics, the visualization of genetic loci using the dynamic recombinant technology of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), now provides the obstetrician and gynaecologist with increasingly important diagnostic and prognostic information heretofore unavailable. The technical principles underlying FISH are briefly discussed. Emphasis is placed on the clinical applications of FISH and technologies derived from FISH, in particular comparative genome hybridization, microdissection FISH and multiplex FISH. These technologies play increasingly significant roles in preimplantation and prenatal genetic diagnosis, in the identification of microdeletion syndromes, cryptic translocations and marker chromosomes, and in defining chromosome mosaicism. FISH and related technologies also constitute essential diagnostic modalities in follow-up of organ transplantation, in a variety of haematological disorders and in determining the amplification of oncogenes associated with specific forms of cancer and neoplasia.
