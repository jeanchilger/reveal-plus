Under-ascertainment of mosaic carriers of balanced homologous acrocentric translocations and isochromosomes. Acrocentric rearrangements are the most common chromosome abnormalities in humans. Carriers of homologous acrocentric rearrangements (Robertsonian translocations (ROBs) between homologous chromosomes and isochromosomes) are at very high risk of having multiple spontaneous abortions and chromosomally abnormal offspring. Parents of fetuses and children with unbalanced homologous acrocentric rearrangements are rarely found to be carriers or mosaic for the same rearrangement. Even though recurrent miscarriages may indicate a carrier parent, carriers are rarely identified. Comparison of non-chromosome 21 homologous rearrangements to rea(21q21q) culled from the literature revealed a 7-fold decrease in the number of mosaic cases among the parents of non-rea(21q21q) offspring. This under-ascertainment in parents may be due to low level mosaicism confined to the gonads, a true biological difference between chromosome 21 rearrangements and other homologous acrocentric rearrangements, or simply to the lack of rigorous clinical investigation of the parental karyotypes to uncover mosaicism. We recommend that polymorphic marker analysis be applied to apparently de novo acrocentric rearrangements to distinguish those resulting from biparental postzygotic formation from those resulting from meiotic formation the latter of which may indicate a potential carrier parent. Parental chromosomal constitutions could then be screened in a large number of cells and in more than one tissue type to identify mosaicism. Identification of mosaicism allows for accurate genetic counseling and discussion of reproductive options. However, given that mosaicism may be restricted to the gonads, prenatal testing is likely to be desired by the family whether or not mosaicism is found.
