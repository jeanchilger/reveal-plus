The expression pattern of hepatitis B e antigen and antibody in different ethnic and clinical groups of hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. The presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and its antibody (anti-HBe) was studied in 249 asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of different ethnic origin and clinical course. Among male homosexuals, renal transplant recipients, and hemodialysis patients, > 90% were HBeAg-positive. In contrast, anti-HBe was present in > 85% of HBsAg-positive Danish pregnant women and blood donors. In presumably immunologically intact persons, significantly elevated levels of transaminases were found in the HBeAg-positive group as compared with the anti-BHe group (P < 0.0001). Among persons with Down's syndrome, males showed a tendency toward clearing of HBeAg and development of anti-BHe as compared with females. In Eskimos a correlation was found between presence of hepatitis B e markers, age of the HBsAg carrier, and geographic origin of the carrier. A similar age relationship was found in Vietnamese refugees. It is proposed that in the general population a correlation may exist between the prevalence of HBsAg carriers and the percentage of HBeAg-positive HBsAg carriers.
