Fetal diagnosis of Edwards syndrome. Eight cases of Edward's syndrome were found prenatally by cytogenetical analysis of 1680 pregnant women. It has been estimated that after Down's syndrome Edwards's syndrome is the most frequently encountered chromosomal abnormality. This syndrome is associated with high rate of anomalies detectable by ultrasound (e.g. omphalocele, polyhydramnion, growth retardation). Here it is discussed in relation with sonographical findings related to Edwards's syndrome and representing clear indications for chromosomal analysis. The authors call attention to the importance of the diagnosis of Edward's syndrome at each gestational age.
