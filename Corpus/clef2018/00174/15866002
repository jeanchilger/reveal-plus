How prenatal diagnosis became acceptable in France. Since the 1960s, prenatal diagnosis techniques have been developed in industrialized countries. There is no therapeutic treatment for most of the diagnosed foetuses and the only solution medicine can offer is abortion therefore, the techniques might seem controversial. Here, I aim to explore why some prenatal diagnosis and screening techniques are widely used when pregnant women are often ambivalent about them. This article draws on previous sociological work, accounts of health practitioners and a case study of the diffusion of Down's Syndrome prenatal diagnosis in France. It argues that numerous factors, other than the demand of the users, can contribute to speed up the diffusion of a technique.
