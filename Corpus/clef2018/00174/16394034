Screening for Down syndrome: practice patterns and knowledge of obstetricians and gynecologists. To assess obstetricians' practice patterns and knowledge regarding screening for Down syndrome.A questionnaire was mailed to 1,105 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Fellows and Junior Fellows in 2004.Sixty percent of questionnaires were returned. Statistical analyses were limited to the 532 practicing obstetricians. Greater than 80% felt their training and experience qualified them to counsel patients about genetic issues in pregnancy. However, 45% rated their residency training regarding prenatal diagnosis as barely adequate or nonexistent. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists publications were rated by 86% as an important source of information on genetic counseling. Seventy-eight percent of practitioners counsel all obstetric patients about risks for fetal aneuploidy, and 67% provide counseling for heritable genetic abnormalities. Although the majority (99%) offer second-trimester Down syndrome screening, only 55% also offer first-trimester screening for Down syndrome. Almost one half (49%) use the quad screen, and 6% offer integrated first- and second-trimester screening. The majority (88%) routinely offer amniocentesis to patients who are at elevated risk for genetic abnormalities, whereas 44% also offer chorionic villus sampling. Few (2%) perform chorionic villus sampling.Most obstetricians manage patients at risk for fetal genetic abnormalities according to American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists educational materials. This survey identified deficiencies related to Down syndrome screening, including a limited number of practitioners performing chorionic villus sampling and physicians' own perception that training regarding genetic counseling should be improved. Educational strategies are needed to address these deficiencies before first-trimester screening programs are widely implemented.III.
