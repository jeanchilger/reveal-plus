Morphologic anomalies in triploid liveborn fetuses. Analysis of the morphologic features of 43 complete and 11 mosaic triploid infants delivered at or after 22 weeks of gestation revealed, in addition to well-delineated gross features, a number of new or previously little emphasized histopathologic features. These included testicular Leydig cell hyperplasia, increased levels of hematopoiesis, and ovarian, adrenal, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Some of these findings appeared to be linked to partial hydatidiform mole replacing the normal placenta, which was present in about 70 per cent of the triploid cases. It is important to recognize the breadth of the triploidy spectrum, which ranges from near normalcy to multisystem involvement, and to pay special attention to the placenta. The importance of correct morphologic diagnosis of triploidy is stressed in view of the fact that its occurrence apparently does not prejudice the future reproductive performance of the parents.
