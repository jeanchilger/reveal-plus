Fluorescent in situ hybridization: an effective and less costly technique for genetic evaluation of products of conception in pregnancy losses. In this study, we applied the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique and compared the common numerical abnormalities with chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, X, and Y in spontaneous to artificial abortion. This would cover about 75% of the common aneuploidy in spontaneous abortion.Placentas were taken from 59 patients with a first trimester spontaneous abortion and 61 patients who underwent an elective first trimester pregnancy termination. The range of growth was from 5 to 12 gestational weeks. Placentas were processed according to direct chorionic villi preparation. Direct dual color FISH was performed according to Vysis protocol with the probes for the following chromosomes: 13, 16, 18, 21, X, and Y.The aneuploidy rate in spontaneous abortion was 55.9% and in artificial abortion 8.2%. There was a significant difference between the two groups in the aneuploidy rate (P = 6 x 10(-9)).FISH is a rapid, efficient, and relatively inexpensive tool in detecting aneuploidy in placentas from cases of spontaneous abortions. Our rate of detected aneuploidy is compatible with other reports in which conventional cytogenetics was utilized.
