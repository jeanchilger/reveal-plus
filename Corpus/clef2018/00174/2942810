Attitudes of mothers of children with Down syndrome concerning amniocentesis, abortion, and prenatal genetic counseling techniques. Mothers of children with Down syndrome were surveyed by questionnaire concerning their attitudes about amniocentesis, prenatal genetic counseling, and abortion. Of the 101 who responded, 40 had borne children after giving birth to a child with Down syndrome. Half had amniocentesis in subsequent pregnancies but only half of these said they would abort the pregnancy if Down syndrome was confirmed. Extreme variations in opinions were noted among the replies. Recognizing patient ambivalence and attempting to provide counseling that represents both positive and negative data about Down syndrome may help physicians avoid conflicts with patients who request prenatal genetic counseling.
