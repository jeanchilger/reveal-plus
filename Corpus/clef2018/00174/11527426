Manifold reduction of moesin in fetal Down syndrome brain. Moesin is a member of the ERM family and is involved in plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton cross-linking, resulting cell adhesion, shape, and motility. Because moesin was shown to be highly expressed in growth cones and moesin/radixin suppression led to impaired structure and function of this key element in brain development, we tested the ERM family, ezrin, radixin, and moesin, in fetal Down syndrome (DS) cortex at the early second trimester. We applied two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with subsequent MALDI detection and identification of protein spots followed by quantification with specific software. Moesin was shown to be significantly and manifold reduced in fetal DS brain, whereas reduction of ezrin and radixin did not reach statistical significance. We therefore propose the involvement of moesin in developmental impairment of DS brain, including deteriorated arborisation, neuritic outgrowth, and neuronal migration. Furthermore, decreased moesin is the second F-actin bundling protein, besides drebrin, that is manifold reduced in fetal DS brain.
