Stature after 18 months of treatment with synthetic growth hormone in 12 patients with Turner's syndrome. The increased availability of recombined human growth hormone (rhGH) allows its possible use in clinical situations not classically recognized as regular indications. Among these, the Turner's short stature is presently under experimental evaluation for its responsiveness to rhGH. Twelve patients, 10 with a 45, X karyotype, 1 46 XXiq, and 1 mosaicism, have been given rhGH at a dosage of 0.15 U/kg per injection six times a week. Mean age at onset of treatment was 12.8, mean growth retardation was 4.1 SDS according to Sempé. After 18 months of treatment mean growth catch-up was 0.9 SDS. Maximal velocity was reach during the first trimester of treatment and decreased thereafter but was above normal for bone age in all but 2 after 18 months. The bone age increased less than structural age. No side effects were reported. At the present time the efficacy of rhGH in increasing final height in Turner's patients is likely but not demonstrated by any studies. The exact place of ovarian substitution, even during the prepubertal period, is still matter of discussion. Since the velocity response to rhGH was maximal among the youngest patients an early diagnosis of the syndrome will likely be necessary to improve final stature.
