Prevention of age-related aneuploidies by polar body testing of oocytes. We previously demonstrated that aneuploidy-free oocytes may be preselected by testing the first and second polar bodies removed from oocytes following their maturation and fertilization. The present paper describes the results of the application of the method in 659 in vitro fertilization cycles from patients of advanced maternal age.Using micromanipulation techniques, 3943 oocytes were tested by polar body sampling and fluorescent on situ hybridization analysis using specific probes for chromosomes 13, 18, and 21.Fluorescent in situ hybridization results were available for 3217 (81.6%) of 3943 oocytes studied, of which 1388 (43.1%) had aneuploidies 35.7% of the aneuploidies were of first meiotic division origin, and 26.1% of second meiotic division origin. Most errors in the first meiotic division were represented by chromatid malsegregation. The transfer of embryos deriving from 1558 of 1829 aneuploidy-free oocytes in 614 treatment cycles resulted in 131 clinical pregnancies and 88 healthy children born after confirmation of the polar body diagnosis.Polar body testing of oocytes provides an accurate and reliable approach for prevention of age-related aneuploidies in in vitro fertilization patients of advanced maternal age.
