Confined placental mosaicism in CVS and pregnancy outcome. The perinatal outcome of 26 patients with confined placental mosaicism (CPM) detected in chorionic villus sampling (CVS) who wished to continue their pregnancies was compared with that of two controls per patient matched for age and parity (n = 52). There were no significant differences in birth weight or gestational age at delivery between patients with CPM and controls. There were no cases of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in the CPM patients as compared with two (2/52, 3.8 per cent) in the control group (P > 0.05). There was no significant increase in fetal loss between the study group (1/26, 3.6 per cent) and the controls (1/52, 1.9 per cent) (P > 0.05).
