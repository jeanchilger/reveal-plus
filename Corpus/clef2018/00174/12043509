Molecular genetic testing in amniotic fluid. The recent progress in cloning and sequencing the genes responsible for genetic diseases and the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) allow to test genetic diseases with a few quantity of DNA. Amniotic cells are easily sampled by using amniocentesis. When abnormal ultrasound allows to suspect a genetic disease, PCR on DNA from amniotic cells is a very efficient test to confirm or exclude the presence of the disease. Microsatellites sequences can be used on amniotic cells as a rapid test for chromosomal aneuploidies.
