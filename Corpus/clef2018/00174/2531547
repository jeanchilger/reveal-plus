Long-bone growth in fetuses with Down syndrome. Short stature is a well-recognized component of Down syndrome. The femur lengths of affected fetuses have been observed to be shorter than normal, with a ratio of actual to expected femur length of less than 0.91 indicating a high risk of trisomy. To further evaluate this finding we have determined the relationship between limb lengths and gestational age in 37 postmortem fetal specimens with trisomy 21. Control values were obtained from 174 normal fetuses. Measurements of the femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, radius, and ulna were made from roentgenograms or by direct measurement of the bone. Most measurements for each bone of the affected fetuses fell below the normal regression line for that bone, but only 3/37 femurs, 4/32 tibias, 5/32 fibulas, 9/32 humeri, 10/32 radii, and 7/32 ulnas fell more than 2 SDs below the mean. The ratios of actual to expected femur lengths were computed and six fetuses with Down syndrome (16.2%) had ratios less than 0.91. The bones of the extremities of fetuses with trisomy 21 are shorter than normal, but the differences are relatively small. The ratio of actual/expected femur lengths was a less efficient predictor of Down syndrome than were either maternal age or maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests. The upper extremity bones were shorter than normal more often than were the bones of the lower extremity, and this finding should be explored further in a prospective study.
