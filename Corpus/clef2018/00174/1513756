A further prenatal diagnosis of mosaic tetrasomy 12p (Pallister-Killian syndrome) A case of mosaic tetrasomy 12p was detected in amniotic fluid cell cultures from a 28-year-old woman referred to us at 26 weeks' gestation because of hydramnios. The fetus was shown on ultrasonography to have an omphalocele and a short femur length. Labour was induced at 32 weeks. An infant with multiple congenital anomalies was delivered and died after 10 min. The diagnosis of i(12p) or Pallister-Killian syndrome was confirmed cytogenetically in fibroblast and lymphocyte cultures. Increased LDH-B activity was demonstrated in fibroblasts.
