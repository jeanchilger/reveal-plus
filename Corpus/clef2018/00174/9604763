Incidence of chromosomal abnormalities from a morphologically normal cohort of embryos in poor-prognosis patients. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of aneuploidy was performed on the embryos yielded by 70 poor-prognosis patients, with the aim of transferring those with a normal chromosomal complement, thus possibly increasing the chances of pregnancy.Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied for the simultaneous detection of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 16, 18, and 21. Inclusion criteria were (1) a maternal age of 36 years or older (n = 33), (2) three or more previous in vitro fertilization cycles (n = 20), and (3) an altered karyotype (n = 17).A total of 412 embryos underwent FISH, resulting in 234 (57%) that were chromosomally abnormal. Euploid embryos were available for transfer in 59 patients, generating 19 pregnancies (32%), with an implantation rate of 19.9%.High rates of chromosomally abnormal embryos in poor-prognosis patients can determine repeated in vitro fertilization failures when embryo selection is performed on the basis of morphological criteria alone. Hence, the FISH analysis could represent the prevailing approach for the identification of embryos possessing full potential for developing to term.
