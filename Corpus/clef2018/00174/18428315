Preparation and culture of products of conception and other solid tissues for chromosome analysis. In clinical settings, chromosome studies are usually performed on solid tissue other than solid tumors for one of two reasons: the tissue biopsy is the only tissue available from the patient, or tissues other than the standard peripheral blood lymphocytes must be examined because of suspected mosaicism. The Basic Protocol, Alternate Protocol 1, and Alternate Protocol 2 describe a method for culturing tissue samples to be used for preparation of metaphase chromosomes and subsequent examination or for biochemical or DNA analysis. The Basic Protocol describes mechanical disruption of the specimen to provide free access of the cells to the culture surface, whereas Alternate Protocol 1 describes a more efficient enzymatic disruption procedure. Support Protocol 1 and Support Protocol 2 describe methods of collecting tissue samples. Alternate Protocol 2, which can sometimes be applied to placental tissue, involves use of mitotically active chorionic villus tissue to prepare metaphase chromosome spreads directly without the need for cell culture.
