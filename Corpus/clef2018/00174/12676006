Impact of preimplantation genetic diagnosis on IVF outcome in implantation failure patients. Implantation failure (IF) is defined as three or more failed IVF attempts, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is being used in these patients to improve IVF outcome. PGD was performed in 49 implantation failure patients with a mean number of 4.2 +/- 1.6 previous IVF failures, and in nine fertile controls. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) on blastomeres from biopsied day 3 embryos was performed for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y. There was a significantly higher rate of chromosomal abnormalities (67.4%) compared with controls (36.3%). In 57 cycles, a pregnancy rate of 34.0% and an implantation rate of 19.8% was observed in implantation failure patients compared with controls (33.3 and 24.1% respectively), with all the pregnancies in the implantation failure group coming from the transfer of at least one chromosomally normal blastocyst on day 5. It is concluded that in IVF patients, use of PGD along with blastocyst transfer improves IVF outcome.
