Molecular cytogenetic study of patients with Pallister-Killian syndrome. The Pallister-Killian syndrome (PKS) is characterized by tissue limited chromosomal mosaicism, i.e. the presence of a supernumerary metacentric chromosome [i(12p)] often confined to skin fibroblasts while the karyotype of cultured lymphocytes is normal. In the present study, chromosome painting by chromosomal in situ suppression (CISS) hybridization and interphase cytogenetic procedures employing biotinylated or digoxigenin labelled probes was carried out. These probes comprised a chromosome 12 specific library (LA 12NS01) and chromosome 12 centromere specific alpha-satellite (pSP12-1). They were used to analyse and quantify the presence of i(12p) in lymphocytes, granulocytes/monocytes, skin fibroblasts and buccal mucosal cells from five patients and one aborted fetus with PKS, and ten normal donors. CISS hybridization on mitotic skin fibroblasts reliably indicated the presence of i(12p) cells, even when metaphases of poor quality were included in the analysis. Two of the five patients showed i(12p) in a small proportion (< or = 0.5%) of the cultured lymphocytes too. The interphase cytogenetics procedure did not reveal the isochromosome in lymphocytes or granulocytes/monocytes in any of the patients. Two of the six patients had a twofold increase in the number of buccal mucosal cells with three hybridization signals over control values. However, for mucosal cells, methodological improvements are required. For cytogenetic diagnosis of PKS, cultured fibroblasts subjected to chromosome painting by CISS hybridization with a chromosome 12 specific library probe are recommended.
