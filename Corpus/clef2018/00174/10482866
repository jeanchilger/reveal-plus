Increased nuchal translucency in trisomy 13 fetuses at 10-14 weeks of gestation. In a multicenter screening study for trisomy 21 involving ultrasonographic measurement of fetal nuchal translucency thickness (NT) at 10-14 weeks of gestation, 100,311 singleton pregnancies with a live fetus were examined. There were 46 cases of trisomy 13, and in 33 (72%) of these, the NT was above the 95th centile. The estimated risk for trisomy 21, based on maternal age-related risk for this chromosomal abnormality and fetal NT, was above 1 in 300 in 37 (80.1%) of the trisomy 13 fetuses. The fetal crown-rump length was significantly reduced, but the fetal heart rate was increased, being above the 95th centile in 64% of cases. Additionally, 24% of trisomy 13 fetuses had holoprosencephaly and 10% had exomphalos. This study has demonstrated that at 10-14 weeks of gestation, about 80% of fetuses with trisomy 13 can be identified in a screening program for trisomy 21, based on a combination of maternal age and fetal NT.
