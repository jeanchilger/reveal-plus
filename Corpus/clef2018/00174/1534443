Fetal humeral length to detect Down syndrome. Our aim was to evaluate the utility of ultrasonographic humeral length measurements for detection of fetuses with Down syndrome in the midtrimester of gestation.Ultrasonographic biometry data obtained before genetic amniocenteses on 43 fetuses with Down syndrome and 204 randomly chosen normal fetuses were analyzed. Regression equations relating biparietal diameter to humeral length and femoral length were used to calculate ratios of observed-to-expected length and sensitivity and specificity at various cutoff points.Humeral length in Down syndrome fetuses was significantly shorter than in normal controls (p less than 0.001). A ratio of 0.90 for observed/expected humeral length yielded a sensitivity of 28%, a specificity of 91%, and positive predictive values of 1.23% and 0.41% in populations at risk for Down syndrome of 1 in 250 and 1 in 750, respectively. The equivalent ratio for femoral length yielded a sensitivity of 19%, a specificity of 91%, and positive predictive values of 0.87% and 0.28% for baseline risks of 1 in 250 and 1 in 750, respectively.The sensitivity of fetal humeral length measurements for Down syndrome detection in our hands was remarkably lower than previously reported. Independence of this parameter from currently used serum screening markers has not been established therefore implementation in screening programs is not advisable at this point.
