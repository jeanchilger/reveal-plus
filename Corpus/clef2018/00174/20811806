The utility of embryo banking in order to increase the number of embryos available for preimplantation genetic screening in advanced maternal age patients. to determine if embryo banking with PGS is more optimal than proceeding with PGS regardless of embryo number.patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 were those that banked embryos and proceeded through another round of IVF prior to PGS, and group 2 underwent PGS regardless of embryo number. Group 2 was divided into group 2A (patients with >10 embryos) and group 2B (patients who had <10 embryos).there was no difference in embryos biopsied, normal embryos, number transferred, and pregnancy rate between group 1 and 2. A significant number of patients did not have a transfer in group 2B (6/11) compared to group 1 (3/19) (P = 0.0419). There was no significance between pregnancy rates per transfer between group 1 (6/16) and group 2B (2/5).our data suggests that banking will increase the odds of going to transfer but there was no increase in pregnancy rates.
