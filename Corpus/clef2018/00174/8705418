Intracardiac fibrin adhesive for selective fetocide in twin pregnancy: report of three cases. Intracardiac fibrin adhesive was used for selective fetocide in three diamniotic twin pregnancies at 18-24 weeks' gestation (trisomy 21: n = 1 ultrasound evidence of major malformation: n = 2). Two of the three pregnancies were complicated by an intra-amniotic infection leading to pregnancy loss but one patient (with a monochorionic twin gestation) delivered a normal baby prematurely in the 31st week of pregnancy. The technique, complications and pregnancy outcomes are discussed.
