The biochemical screening of Down's syndrome. Since the initial observation of an association between low maternal serum aFP and trisomies noninvasive for chromosomal abnormalities is an obvious goal of genetics and obstetricians. Here are reported the results of a biochemical screening for fetal trisomies study based on the dosages of maternal serum aFP, bHCG and uE3 at 16 week gestational age on 1166 pregnant women without risk factors for genetical abnormalities. Sensitivity, positive predictivity and negative predictivity of the screening were 50%, 42.86% and 99.74% respectively.
