What next for preimplantation genetic screening? A clinician's perspective. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) is a technique that has been introduced into clinical practice to screen and eliminate aneuploid embryos from transfer with the intention to improve implantation rates and decrease pregnancy wastage. Although practiced widely throughout the world, PGS unfortunately has been adopted without being subjected to rigorous scientific validation. Data from recent randomized trials have shed doubt on the efficacy of the procedure when used in women with advanced age, one of the target populations for PGS. Other purported indications for the application of this complicated technique such as recurrent implantation failure and recurrent spontaneous abortion have not been subjected to randomized controlled trials. For the best interest of patients, we feel it is timely for a debate regarding the efficacy and safety of PGS.
