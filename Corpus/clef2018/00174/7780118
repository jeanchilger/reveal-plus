Mosaicism confined to placenta in pregnancies with adverse outcome. Chorionic villi and fetal tissues from 50 pathological human conceptions at gestational weeks 9-40 were cultured and cytogenetically analyzed to explore the existence of chromosomal mosaicism confined to the extraembryonic tissues and to clarify the relationship between confined placental mosaicism and adverse outcome of pregnancy. Chorionic villi and fetal tissues from 12 second trimester gestations terminated for social reasons served as a control group. In two pathological gestations, true mosaicism was found exclusively in chorionic cells and could not be confirmed in cells derived from the fetal tissues. One of these was severely growth retarded. Concordant results were obtained in all other cases.
