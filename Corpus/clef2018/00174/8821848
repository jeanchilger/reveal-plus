Incidence and significance of chromosome mosaicism involving an autosomal structural abnormality diagnosed prenatally through amniocentesis: a collaborative study. Among 179,663 prenatal diagnosis cases collected from ten institutions and two publications, 555 (0.3 per cent) were diagnosed as having chromosome mosaicism. Of these, 57 (10.3 per cent) were mosaic for an autosomal structural abnormality, 28 (5 per cent) for a sex chromosome structural abnormality, and 85 (15.3 per cent) were mosaic for a marker chromosome. Ninety-five cases of prenatally diagnosed mosaicism with a structural abnormality in an autosome and a normal cell line, and with a known phenotypic outcome, were collected for karyotype-phenotype correlations through our collaboration (40 cases), a prior survey (26 cases), and published reports (29 cases). They included 13 balanced reciprocal translocations, one unbalanced reciprocal translocation, four balanced Robertsonian translocations, four unbalanced Robertsonian translocations, four inversions, 17 deletions, three ring chromosomes, 19 i(20q), seven +i(12p), six other isochromosomes, and 17 partial trisomies resulting from a duplication or other rearrangement. All cases mosaic for a balanced structural rearrangement resulted in a normal phenotype. All cases of 46/46,i(20q) resulted in normal liveborns. Five of seven cases with 46/47,+i(12p) had an abnormal phenotype compatible with Killian-Pallister syndrome. The overall risk for an abnormal outcome for a mosaic case with an unbalanced structural abnormality, excluding 46/46,i(20q) and 46/47,+i(12p), is 40.4 per cent. In the same category, the study also suggested a correlation between the percentage of abnormal cells and an abnormal phenotype. For mosaicism involving a terminal deletion, the possibility of a familial fragile site should be considered.
