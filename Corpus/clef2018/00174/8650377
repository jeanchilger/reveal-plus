Down syndrome: 1. Medical aspects. Each organ of a patient with the Down's Syndrome (trisomy 21) shows the pathology. One notices the specific features already with an infant. The life expectation of these children has increased considerably and it depends upon the appearance or not of a heart defect. The ventricular septum defect is most frequent but a small number of these patients show a complex cardiopathy. The incidence of pulmonary hypertension is also high. The obstruction of gastroenteric tract can cause problems from the prenatal phase onwards. The main endocrinological difficulties are dysfunction of the thyroid gland and also infertility. Ocular disorders like refraction disorders occur frequently. Due to decreased conduction, there is a hearing loss. The cellular immunity is clearly reduced, hence, the susceptibility to infections like hepatitis B, increases. The major oral problems are apparently oversized tongue and a high sensitivity to gingivitis.
