Prenatal diagnosis in Spain. An overview of the national organisation of prenatal diagnosis (PND) in Spain is presented. Although PND is technically well developed and the number of prenatal services seems to be adequate, the uneven distribution between regions is reflected in a different prevalence reduction of chromosomal disorders and congenital malformations. Only about 41% or pregnant women use PND, with a wide range (14-64%) between regions. There is no national policy in PND or maternal serum screening for Down's syndrome, but local policies. As clinical genetics is not an officially recognised speciality, there is a shortage of clinical geneticists and it is difficult to organise PND activities and regulate them by law.
