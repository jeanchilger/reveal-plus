Patient and health professional acceptance of integrated serum screening for Down syndrome. Integrated testing for Down syndrome combines first trimester maternal serum and nuchal translucency (NT) measurements with second trimester maternal serum measurements into a single second trimester Down syndrome risk. A variant of integrated testing, the integrated serum test, requires only the serum measurements and may be more suitable for widespread use in the general pregnancy population. Concern has been voiced that women will find the delay associated with waiting for screening results unacceptable for either fully integrated (including NT measurements) or integrated serum testing. To address this issue, we surveyed 60 women from a population of 8773 women enrolled in an integrated serum screening intervention trial in Maine. The women all had also undergone traditional second trimester screening 1 to 2 years earlier. All 60 women remembered having the integrated serum test, and 59 remembered having a prenatal test in their previous pregnancy. Three-quarters of women did not experience anxiety relating to the wait for final results in the second trimester, and 95% would consider being screened by the integrated serum test in a future pregnancy. Women receiving prenatal care at the primary care level are prepared to wait until the second trimester for more accurate Down syndrome risk estimates on which to base their decision-making.
