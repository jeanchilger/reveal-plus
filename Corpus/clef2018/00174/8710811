Gene expression of human pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A in placenta from trisomic pregnancies. Placental pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) mRNA expression, placental PAPP-A protein concentration and maternal serum levels of PAPP-A were examined in pregnancies affected by trisomy 21 (n=8), trisomy 18 (n=7) and 15 normal controls at 12-15 weeks of gestation. The maternal serum concentration of PAPP-A in the trisomic group of pregnancies was significantly lower than in the normal controls. However there were no significant differences between the three groups in PAPP-A mRNA expression or PAPP-A protein concentration in the placental tissues. There was no significant association between the level of placental mRNA and either placental protein or maternal serum PAPP-A concentrations in the normal or trisomic pregnancies. There was however a significant association between placental protein and maternal serum PAPP-A concentrations in the normal and trisomy 21 pregnancies but not in those affected by trisomy 18. These findings suggest that the decrease in maternal serum PAPP-A in trisomic pregnancies is due to alternations in post-translational events such as protein stability, alterations in the release mechanism of the protein, impaired protein transport across the placenta or modified serum stability of PAPP-A.
