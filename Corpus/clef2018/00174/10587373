Assessment of multiplex fluorescent PCR for screening single cells for trisomy 21 and single gene defects. A great majority of patients seeking preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) are women >35 years of age. In addition to being carriers for single gene defects, these women also have a higher risk of having children with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21). For these patients, it would be advantageous if a diagnostic test for trisomy 21 was developed, which could be used in conjunction with tests for single gene defects. Here, we assessed the feasibility of developing an accurate genetic test for diagnosing trisomy 21 and the mutation causing spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in single cells using multiplex fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Single- and two-round PCR were developed using a combination of primers for the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene exons 7 and 8 and two chromosome 21 short tandem repeats (STRs), D21S226 and D21S11. After only 36 cycles, 88 and 68% of normal single cells were screened for SMA mutations and trisomy 21 respectively. In multiplex PCR using only two primers (SMN exon 7 and D21S11) instead of four, the efficiency of SMA diagnosis was increased to 93%. In the same reactions, the D21S11 alleles were detected in 83% of the normal single cells. Clinical applications of this assay should enable detection of those embryos that have inherited three heterozygous alleles and, therefore, benefit many PGD patients who are at an increased risk of Down's syndrome.
