Prenatal screening for trisomy 21 with maternal serum markers: information for decision-making in pregnant women. French health professionals are now required to provide relevant information on the test screening for Down syndrome and its possible implications when making the test available to pregnant women. A questionnaire was designed to assess prescription modalities, explanation of results, opinion on the information received when test was offered and test results were given, and likely decision after screening.The response rate was 39% (1473 questionnaires analyzed). In 90.5% of the answers, women declared that an interview had preceded test prescription. 61.2% of women were satisfied with both the clarity and quantity of explanations provided and 57.6% considered that the information had helped them decide to undergo or refuse screening. 54.1% were satisfied with the explanations of test results. Amniocentesis was proposed to 125 women, 79.2% of which decided to undergo the procedure. Their opinion concerning explanations of test results was similar to that of women who refused amniocentesis or had not yet made up their minds.Such results demonstrate the necessity to improve and adapt the information delivered by health professionals, keeping in mind that in this type of situation, decision making requires the rapid integration of complex information.
