Feasibility of chorionic villous sampling outside a prenatal diagnosis center. According to new recommendations, a high combined risk for Down syndrome in the first trimester of pregnancy must indicate the need for a prenatal diagnosis. This is possible thanks to chorionic villous sampling. The objective of our study was to show that chorionic villous sampling is achievable in everyday practice, even outside research centers for pre-natal diagnosis.It was a descriptive, retrospective study. All the patients who underwent a chorionic villous sampling in our level II maternity center from November 2005 to September 2009 were included. Success and complications rates linked with the procedure were calculated.One hundred and fourteen pregnancies were included. A definitive diagnosis was given in 98.25% of cases. A secondary amniocentesis was necessary in 1.75% of cases. A medical termination of the pregnancy was done in 18.42% of cases. Without accounting for underlying pathology, fetal loss rate was up to 5.75%. Only one case of unexpected fetal loss was noted (1.15% of the ongoing pregnancies).Our study shows that the presence of trained professional allows for onsite performance chorionic villous sampling.
