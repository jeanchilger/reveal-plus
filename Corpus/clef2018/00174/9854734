Confined placental mosaicism for trisomy 8 and intra-uterine growth retardation. This report describes a case of apparent confined placental mosaicism for trisomy 8 in a pregnancy which produced a male infant with intra-uterine growth retardation. Postnatal cytogenetic and molecular studies were consistent with biparental disomy 8. Postnatally, the infant experienced a period of rapid catch-up growth and exhibited no clinical features of trisomy 8 mosaicism. His development was age appropriate.
