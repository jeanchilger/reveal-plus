Cocaine and trisomy 8 associated with prenatal diagnosis of corpus callosum agenesis. We report the case of a newborn presenting an agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) discovered in the prenatal period and initially related to cocaine exposure during the first trimester of gestation. The cytogenetic analysis revealed a trisomy 8 mosaicism. The putative role of prenatal cocaine exposure and mosaicism for chromosome 8 in ACC are discussed. This report emphasizes the specific analysis of chromosome 8 by using fluorescence in situ hybridization as a complement to routine cytogenetic analysis for prenatal diagnosis of ACC.
