First trimester combined screening for Trisomy 21 in Hong Kong: outcome of the first 10,000 cases. To examine the effectiveness of first trimester fetal Trisomy 21 (T21) screening using a combination of maternal age, nuchal translucency, maternal serum levels of free beta-hCG and PAPP-A in a predominantly Chinese population in Hong Kong.Consecutive women who underwent the combined screening for T21 between 11 and 13 + 6 weeks of gestation between 2003 and 2007 were recruited. Risk of T21 was calculated using Fetal Medicine Foundation algorithm and karyotyping was advised when the risk was 1:300 or above. All women were followed up for pregnancy and fetal outcome.10,363 fetuses underwent screening. 99% of the women were Chinese and 27.4% were at or above 35 years old. 618 fetuses were screened positive (5.9%), which included 31 cases of T21, 14 cases of T18, 7 cases of T13, 10 cases of 45XO and 7 cases of other chromosomal abnormalities. Among the 9745 screened negative fetuses all but 50 (0.5%) had a known outcome, which included three T21 and four other chromosomal abnormalities. All were subsequently identified at the morphology scan except for one case of T21. The detection rate and false positive rates for T21 were 91.2% and 5.4%, respectively and the positive predictive value for all chromosomal abnormalities was 1 in 9.Combined screening for T21 is highly effective among Chinese women. Training, quality control, regular auditing and follow up are essential to maintain screening standards.
