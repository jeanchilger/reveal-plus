Prenatal detection and outcome of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) associated with deletion of chromosome 15q26: two patients and review of the literature. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a severe birth defect characterized by a defect in the diaphragm with pulmonary hypoplasia and postnatal pulmonary hypertension. Approximately 50% of CDH cases are associated with other non-pulmonary congenital anomalies (so called non-isolated CDH) and in 5-10% of cases there is a chromosomal etiology. The majority of CDH cases are detected prenatally. In some cases prenatal chromosome analysis reveals a causative chromosomal anomaly, most often aneuploidy. Deletion of 15q26 is the most frequently described structural chromosomal aberration in patients with non-isolated CDH. In this paper we report on two patients with a deletion of 15q26 and phenotypes similar to other patients with CDH caused by 15q26 deletions. This phenotype consists of intra-uterine growth retardation, left-sided CDH, cardiac anomalies and characteristic facial features, similar to those seen in Fryns syndrome. We propose that when this combination of birth defects is identified, either pre- or postnatally, further investigations to confirm or exclude a deletion of 15q26 are indicated, since the diagnosis of this deletion will have major consequences for the prognosis and, therefore, can affect decision making.
