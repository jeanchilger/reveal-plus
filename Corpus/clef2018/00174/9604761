Preimplantation diagnosis of common aneuploidies by the first- and second-polar body FISH analysis. A low pregnancy rate in in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients of advanced maternal age may be caused by aneuploidies originating from non disjunction in the first or second meiotic divisions. We introduced genetic testing of oocytes by sampling and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the first and second polar bodies, to avoid fertilization and transfer of aneuploid oocytes in IVF patients of advanced maternal age.Three hundred and sixty-three IVF patients 34 years and older participated in the study. Using micromanipulation procedures, the first and second polar bodies were removed following their extrusion from the oocytes and studied by FISH, using probes specific for chromosomes 13, 18, and 21 to detect oocytes with common aneuploidies.Of a total of 538 IVF cycles, 3250 oocytes were available for FISH analysis, with conclusive FISH results in 2742 oocytes (84.3%). As many as 1102 (40%) of oocytes were predicted to be aneuploid and not transferred. Of 1640 embryos predicted to be normal, 1145 were transferred in 467 treatment cycles, resulting in 107 pregnancies (23%), from which 67 healthy children have been born, 32 pregnancies spontaneously aborted, and 15 pregnancies are ongoing after being confirmed normal by prenatal diagnosis.Preimplantation diagnosis by first- and second-polar body FISH analysis allows us to avoid the age-related risk of common aneuploidies in IVF patients of advanced maternal age.
