The management of multiple pregnancy. The epidemic of multiple pregnancy continues albeit in a different form with twin pregnancies predominating. Determination of chorionicity is the key to management and regular monitoring by ultrasound is a hallmark of quality care. All multiple pregnancies should be offered first trimester screening by nuchal translucency for aneuploidy. MC twins should be scanned at fortnightly intervals to allow complications such as twin-twin transfusion or IUGR to be detected and referral made to a fetal medicine centre. Maternal complications are common and vigilance is required for their detection. Although planned vaginal delivery can often be achieved, mothers must be prepared for the substantial risk of requiring a caesarean section as this currently occurs in the majority.
