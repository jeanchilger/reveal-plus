Detection of chromosomal abnormalities by fluorescent in-situ hybridization in immotile viable spermatozoa determined by hypo-osmotic sperm swelling test. If randomly selected immotile spermatozoa are used for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), pregnancy rates are significantly decreased. The hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) is the only method available to detect the viable, but immotile spermatozoa for ICSI. However, evidence is still lacking for the chromosomal abnormalities for the normal-looking, but immotile spermatozoa positive for HOST. Sperm samples from 20 infertile men with normal chromosomal constitution were obtained. After Percoll separation, morphologically normal but immotile spermatozoa were transported individually into HOST solution for 1 min using micropipettes. Cells that showed tail curling with swelling in HOST were then transferred back into human tubal fluid solution to allow reversal of swelling. These sperm cells were fixed and processed for the multi-colour fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosomes X, Y and 18. The same FISH procedure was applied for the motile spermatozoa from the same cohort, which formed the control group. The average aneuploidy rates were 1.70 and 1.54% in 1000 HOST positive immotile and motile spermatozoa respectively detected by FISH for each patient. Our results indicate that morphologically normal, immotile but viable spermatozoa have an aneuploidy rate similar to that of normal motile spermatozoa.
