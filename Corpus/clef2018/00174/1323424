Flow cytometric analysis of trophoblastic tumors. 19 cases of malignant trophoblastic tumors were studied by flow cytometry in comparison with 9 cases of benign hydatidiform mole that had been followed up for 1.5 years with no history of malignancy. The results showed that there were significant differences in DNA index (DI), S phase of cells and the pattern of ploidies between the malignant trophoblastic tumor and benign hydatidiform mole. It is considered that flow cytometry is a useful parameter in reference to the diagnosis, chemotherapy and assessing prognosis of malignant trophoblastic tumor.
