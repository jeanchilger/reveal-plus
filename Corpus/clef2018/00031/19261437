Semi-automated assessment of left ventricular mass using transaxial Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT imaging. The "left ventricular mass" (LVM) using Tc-99m Sestamibi SPECT imaging may be a useful parameter to quantitatively assess the left ventricle and hence its function. The LVM was determined without reorienting the images along the long axis of the left ventricle. A comparison with reoriented SPECT images was then performed. The LVM showed the expected variations among different pathological heart conditions and the control subjects. The left ventricular mass obtained from non-reoriented tomographic views of the myocardium can be a useful index to quantitatively assess various heart conditions where the myocardium lacks perfusion either between rest and stress studies or similar conditions in longitudinal studies.
