Convergent incremental optimization transfer algorithms: application to tomography. No convergent ordered subsets (OS) type image reconstruction algorithms for transmission tomography have been proposed to date. In contrast, in emission tomography, there are two known families of convergent OS algorithms: methods that use relaxation parameters, and methods based on the incremental expectation-maximization (EM) approach. This paper generalizes the incremental EM approach by introducing a general framework, "incremental optimization transfer." The proposed algorithms accelerate convergence speeds and ensure global convergence without requiring relaxation parameters. The general optimization transfer framework allows the use of a very broad family of surrogate functions, enabling the development of new algorithms. This paper provides the first convergent OS-type algorithm for (nonconcave) penalized-likelihood (PL) transmission image reconstruction by using separable paraboloidal surrogates (SPS) which yield closed-form maximization steps. We found it is very effective to achieve fast convergence rates by starting with an OS algorithm with a large number of subsets and switching to the new "transmission incremental optimization transfer (TRIOT)" algorithm. Results show that TRIOT is faster in increasing the PL objective than nonincremental ordinary SPS and even OS-SPS yet is convergent.
