Leukemia and lymphoma. Leukemia and lymphoma are the most common and third most common pediatric malignancies, respectively, and share cell lineages, but the clinical and imaging manifestations of these malignancies vary substantially. Along with providing pertinent details on classification, epidemiology, and treatment, this article reviews the current roles of imaging in the management of childhood leukemia and lymphoma, with attention to diagnosis, staging, risk stratification, therapy response assessment, and surveillance for disease relapse and adverse effects of therapy. Advances in functional imaging are also discussed to provide insights into future applications of imaging in the management of pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma.
