Current concepts in the management of a second malignancy of the lung in patients with head and neck cancer. Simultaneous, synchronous, and metachronous presentation of lung malignancies when treating head and neck squamous cell cancers is one of the most difficult challenges in head and neck surgery. However, good (> 40%) 5-year survival can be obtained when proper screening techniques, patient selection, and therapy are combined. Because of the complexity of the head and neck resection and reconstruction and the multiple surgical and medical services used to diagnose and treat this clinical entity, a comprehensive review of the current literature is provided. The clinically pertinent meanings of simultaneous, synchronous, and metachronous second malignancy of the lung are presented. A review of the current literature is presented that divides second lung malignancy into two groups: second primary and metastasis. The incidence of a second lung malignancy is identified. The tools used in the screening of high-risk patients and the role of the new diagnostic studies such as positron emission tomography and positron emission tomography CT scans are reviewed. Finally, the current literature on patient selection and surgical therapy is used to put forth a clinical pathway followed at the authors' institution for the treatment of these patients.
