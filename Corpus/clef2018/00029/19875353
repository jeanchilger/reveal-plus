Positron emission tomography and evaluation of response to targeted therapies. The development of new-targeted therapies has highlighted the need to adapt the criteria used so far for radiological assessment of tumor response, but also the search for new criteria for a more appropriate evaluation. Nuclear medicine, and especially positron emission tomography (PET) offers a variety of functional imaging for early assessment of tumor response to targeted therapies. In this paper, we first describe data in the literature on PET technique with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in this indication and the associated new molecules. The second part discusses the new positron-emitting tracers that are potentially interesting for the evaluation of action or efficacy of these new molecules (imaging "targeted" to specific metabolic pathways, cell proliferation, hypoxia, angiogenesis, receptors, etc.).
