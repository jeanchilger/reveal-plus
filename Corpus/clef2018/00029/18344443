Modeling considerations for 11C-CUMI-101, an agonist radiotracer for imaging serotonin 1A receptor in vivo with PET. Several lines of evidence demonstrate involvement of serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT1ARs) in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, suicidal behavior, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. We recently published the synthesis and initial evaluation of [O-methyl-11C]2-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)dione (11C-MMP), a 5-HT1AR agonist. Here we determine the optimal modeling parameters for 11C-MMP under its new name, 11C-CUMI-101, in Papio anubis.PET scans were performed on 2 adult male P. anubis 166.5 MBq +/- 43.0 (4.50 +/- 1.16 mCi) of 11C-CUMI-101 were injected as an intravenous bolus, and emission data were collected for 120 min in 3-dimensional mode. We evaluated 4 different models (1- and 2-tissue compartment iterative and noniterative kinetic models, basis pursuit, and likelihood estimation in graphical analysis [LEGA]), using binding potential (BPF = Bmax/Kd) (Bmax = maximum number of binding sitesAll metabolites are more polar than 11C-CUMI-101, and no significant change in metabolites was observed in the blocking studies. The free fraction is 59% +/- 3%. We determined that 100 min of scanning time is adequate and that for the region-of-interest (ROI)-level analysis, the LEGA model gives the best results. The median test-retest percentage difference for BPF is 11.15% +/- 4.82% across all regions, WSMSS = 2.66, variance = 6.07, ICC = 0.43, and bootstrap identifiability = 0.59. Preadministration of WAY100635 and 8-OH-DPAT resulted in 87% and 76% average reductions in BPF values, respectively, across ROIs.On the basis of the measurable free fraction, high affinity and selectivity, adequate blood-brain permeability, and favorable plasma and brain kinetics, 11C-CUMI-101 is an excellent candidate for imaging high-affinity 5-HT1ARs in humans.
