Targeting the lung: preclinical and comparative evaluation of anticancer aerosols in dogs with naturally occurring cancers. Pet dogs with naturally occurring cancers offer a novel opportunity for the study of both cancer biology and therapy. The following review will provide the rationale for the use of these spontaneous cancer models in translational research, particularly in the development of anticancer aerosols. A summary of work involving pet dogs with primary and metastatic cancers to the lung and the investigation of therapeutic chemotherapy and cytokine immunotherapy aerosols will be presented.
