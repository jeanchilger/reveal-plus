Efficacy and safety of yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in Japanese patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of radioimmunotherapies with Zevalin(®) (RIT-Z) in Japanese patients with low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).Sixty-two patients with NHL were enrolled. Based on histology, 49 of the patients had follicular lymphoma and 23 had other lesions. The response was assessed at 8-12 weeks after RIT-Z injection with PET/CT.The overall response rate was 85 %. Thirty-seven (60 %) patients achieved complete remission, 16 (26 %) had partial remission, 4 (6 %) had stable disease, and 5 (8 %) had progressive disease. There was a significant correlation between the response to RIT-Z, frequency of chemotherapy, and history of prior treatment with fludarabine. There was no significant difference in efficacy according to lymphoma type, years since last chemotherapy, patient age, or disease stage at RIT-Z. Thrombocytopenia of grade 4 was significantly correlated with disease stage at RIT-Z and history of prior treatment with fludarabine. There was also no significant correlation between hematotoxicity and lymphoma type, frequency of chemotherapy, years since last chemotherapy, patient age, or history of bone marrow transplant. Anemia was significantly correlated with frequency of chemotherapy, history of bone marrow transplant, and history of prior treatment with fludarabine.The response rate was high, and we were able to decrease the hematologic side effects by using RIT-Z earlier.
