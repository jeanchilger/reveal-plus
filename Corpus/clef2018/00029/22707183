Early detection and longitudinal monitoring of experimental primary and disseminated melanoma using [¹⁰F]ICF01006, a highly promising melanoma PET tracer. Here, we report a new and rapid radiosynthesis of (18)F-N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-6-fluoro-pyridine-3-carboxamide ([(18)F]ICF01006), a molecule with a high specificity for melanotic tissue, and its evaluation in a murine model for early specific detection of pigmented primary and disseminated melanoma.[(18)F]ICF01006 was synthesized using a new one-step bromine-for-fluorine nucleophilic heteroaromatic substitution. Melanoma models were induced by subcutaneous (primary tumour) or intravenous (lung colonies) injection of B16BL6 melanoma cells in C57BL/6J mice. The relevance and sensitivity of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using [(18)F]ICF01006 were evaluated at different stages of tumoural growth and compared to (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG).The fully automated radiosynthesis of [(18)F]ICF01006 led to a radiochemical yield of 61 % and a radiochemical purity >99 % (specific activity 70-80 GBq/μmol total synthesis time 42 min). Tumours were visualized before they were palpable as early as 1 h post-injection with [(18)F]ICF01006 tumoural uptake of 1.64 ± 0.57, 3.40 ± 1.47 and 11.44 ± 2.67 percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) at days 3, 5 and 14, respectively. [(18)F]ICF01006 PET imaging also allowed detection of melanoma pulmonary colonies from day 9 after tumour cell inoculation, with a lung radiotracer accumulation correlated with melanoma invasion. At day 21, radioactivity uptake in lungs reached a value of 5.23 ± 2.08 %ID/g (versus 0.41 ± 0.90 %ID/g in control mice). In the two models, comparison with [(18)F]FDG showed that both radiotracers were able to detect melanoma lesions, but [(18)F]ICF01006 was superior in terms of contrast and specificity.Our promising results provide further preclinical data, reinforcing the excellent potential of [(18)F]ICF01006 PET imaging for early specific diagnosis and follow-up of melanin-positive disseminated melanoma.
