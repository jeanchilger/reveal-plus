The role of 18FDG PET/CT in the management of colorectal liver metastases. Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastases (CLM). However, involvement of both the hepatic lobes or extrahepatic disease (EHD) can be a contra-indication for resection. The aim of the present study was to examine the addition of combined positron emission and computed tomography (PET/CT) to CLM staging to assess the effects upon staging and management.All CLM patients referred to a single centre between January 2005 and January 2009 were prospectively included. All underwent routine staging (clinical examination and computed tomography), followed by a whole body (18) fluoro-deoxy-glucose ((18)FDG)-PET/CT scan and Fong clinical risk score calculation.Sixty-four patients were included [63% male with a median age of 63 years (age range 32-79 years)]. The addition of PET/CT led to disease upstaging in 20 patients (31%) and downstaging in two patients (3%). EHD was found in 24% of low-risk patients (Fong score 0-2) as compared with 44% of high-risk patients (Fong score 3-5) (P= 0.133). There was a trend towards a greater influence upon management in patients with a low score (44% vs. 17% P= 0.080).The addition of PET/CT led to management changes in over one-third of patients but there was no correlation between alterations in staging or management and the Fong clinical risk score suggesting that PET/CT should be utilized, where available, in the pre-operative staging of CLM patients.
