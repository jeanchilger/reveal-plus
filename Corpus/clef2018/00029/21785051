Value of PET/CT in the management of primary hepatobiliary tumors, part 2. Primary hepatobiliary malignancies consist of hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer. Benign hepatic lesions include hepatic cysts, hemagiomas, adenomas, and focal nodular hyperplasias. The utility of PET/CT in imaging primary hepatobiliary lesions varies according to the type and location of the lesion.There is a consistent benefit to the use of PET/CT for detection and staging, and it ultimately helps to establish the best course of treatment and to determine prognosis. In addition, PET/CT is very useful in local ablative and systemic therapy assessment and surveillance for hepatobiliary malignancies.
