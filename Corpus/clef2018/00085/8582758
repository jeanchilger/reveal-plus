Biologically active principles isolated from Salacia oblonga wall. From the petroleum ether extract of the root bark of Salacia Oblonga wall, two biologically active fractions have been isolated by column and thin layer chromatography. The methanol eluted fraction of the extract absorbed on a column of silica gel at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml showed 100 percent cytotoxicity on Ehrlich ascites tumour cells. The chloroform eluted fraction of the pet. ether extract and a fluorescent compound separated from it by TLC demonstrated about 60% and 76% hypoglycemic potency of an equal dose of tolbutamide (250 mg/kg) in albino rats. The results indicate the therapeutic importance of S. Oblonga wall.
