Radiation-induced myositis mimicking chest wall tumor invasion in two patients with lung cancer: a PET/CT study. Two patients with lung cancer who had undergone stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) exhibited increased F-18 FDG uptake in the chest wall after 6 months and 18 months, respectively, after SBRT. The prescribed dose of 50 Gy to the planning target volume was delivered on 4 consecutive days in each patient. It is important for nuclear medicine physicians to be familiar with F-18 FDG PET/CT findings ascribed to radiation-induced myositis in lung cancer patients treated with SBRT so that an appropriate differential diagnosis can be established.
