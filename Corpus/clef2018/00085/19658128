Development of a quadruple imaging modality by using nanoparticles. The combination of nanotechnology with molecular imaging has great potential for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics, and multimodal imaging enables versatile applications from cell tracking in animals to clinical applications. Herein, we report a multimodal nanoparticle imaging system that is capable of concurrent fluorescence, bioluminescence, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in vivo. A cobalt-ferrite nanoparticle surrounded by rhodamine (MF) was conjugated with luciferase (MFB) and p-SCN-bn-NOTA (2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclonane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) followed by (68)GaCl(3) (magnetic-fluorescent-bioluminescent-radioisotopic particle, MFBR). Confocal microscopy revealed good transfection efficiency of MFB into cells and BRET was also observed in MFB. A good correlation among rhodamine, luciferase, and (68)GaCl(3) was found in MFBR, and the activities of each imaging modality increased dose-dependently with the amount of MFBR in the C6 cells. In vivo optical images were acquired from the thighs of mice after intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of MFBR-laden cells. MicroPET and MR images showed intense radioactivity and ferromagnetic intensities with MFBR-laden cells. The multimodal imaging strategy could be used as potential imaging tools to track cells.
