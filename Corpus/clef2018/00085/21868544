Palladin is a marker of liver metastasis in primary pancreatic endocrine carcinomas. Palladin is a metastasis-associated gene regulating cell motility. The expression of palladin protein in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PET) and carcinomas (PECA) is not known.A tissue microarray (TMA) of well-differentiated (WD) PETs/PECAs (AJCC 2010) and non-neoplastic, histologically normal pancreatic tissue/islets (HNPIs) was immunostained with palladin antibody and quantified using the Allred score. The results were correlated with the presence or absence of liver metastases.The retrospective study included 19 males and 19 females of age 27-79 years (mean 54). Tumor size was 0.9-11.5 cm (mean 3.8). Palladin expression was cytoplasmic and/or membranous. The tumors with high palladin expression were associated with liver metastasis (p<0.0001). All 14 primary PECA with hepatic metastases (MP-PECAs) exhibited palladin expression whereas 14 out of 24 (58%) clinically-localized primary PET (CLP-PETs) expressed palladin (p<0.01) with median Allred scores of 5 (range 3-7) and 2 (range 0-6) respectively (p<0.0001). The mean Allred score for the HNPIs in the MP-PECAs (N=6) was higher (4.2) as compared to that in the CLP-PETs (2.5,N=11) (p=0.23).Palladin may identify primary pancreatic endocrine neoplasms with a propensity to metastasize to the liver.
