Increased fat mass compensates for insulin resistance in abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes: a positron-emitting tomography study. To evaluate the relative impact of abdominal obesity and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes on insulin action in skeletal muscle and fat tissue, we studied 61 men with (n = 31) or without (n = 30) diabetes, subgrouped into abdominally obese or nonobese according to the waist circumference. Adipose tissue depots were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging, and regional glucose uptake was measured using 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose/positron emission tomography during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia. Across groups, glucose uptake per unit tissue weight was higher in visceral (20.5 +/- 1.4 micromol . min(-1) . kg(-1)) than in abdominal (9.8 +/- 0.9 micromol min(-1) . kg(-1), P < 0.001) or femoral (12.3 +/- 0.6 micromol . min(-1) . kg(-1), P < 0.001) subcutaneous tissue and approximately 40% lower than in skeletal muscle (33.1 +/- 2.5 micromol . min(-1) . kg(-1), P < 0.0001). Abdominal obesity was associated with a marked reduction in glucose uptake per unit tissue weight in all fat depots and in skeletal muscle (P < 0.001 for all regions). Recent type 2 diabetes per se had little additional effect. In both intra-abdominal adipose (r = -0.73, P < 0.0001) and skeletal muscle (r = -0.53, P < 0.0001) tissue, glucose uptake was reciprocally related to intra-abdominal fat mass in a curvilinear fashion. When regional glucose uptake was multiplied by tissue mass, total glucose uptake per fat depot was similar irrespective of abdominal obesity or type 2 diabetes, and its contribution to whole-body glucose uptake increased by approximately 40% in obese nondiabetic and nonobese diabetic men and was doubled in obese diabetic subjects. We conclude that 1) in abdominal obesity, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake rate is markedly reduced in skeletal muscle and in all fat depots 2) in target tissues, this reduction is reciprocally (and nonlinearly) related to the amount of intra-abdominal fat
