Quantification of the regional cerebral blood flow and vascular reserve in moyamoya disease using split-dose iodoamphetamine I 123 single-photon emission computed tomography. We quantified the rCBF and regional vascular reserve (CVR) in adult patients with moyamoya disease before and after surgery using IMP I 123 SPECT.The patient population included 5 adult patients with ages at presentation ranging between 23 and 42 years. One patient had stroke, whereas 4 patients had transient ischemic attacks.Before surgery, the mean resting rCBF and mean CVR in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes of the surgically treated hemisphere were 40.09, 39.50, and 36.9 mL/100 g per minute and 15.39%, 27.09%, and 28.92%, respectively. After surgery, the rCBF increased significantly (P = .0002, .0005, and .0062), but in a CVR evaluation, only the frontal lobe increased significantly (P = .0055). In the unaffected hemispheres, the mean resting rCBF significantly increased only in the frontal lobe (P = 038) and no significant increase in the CVR was observed after surgery. In 2 patients who showed steal phenomenon induced by acetazolamide administration, CVR significantly increased not only in the frontal lobe but also in the parietal and temporal lobe after surgery, although the CVR in these areas significantly decreased both before and after surgery in comparison to the mean CVR in all patients.The frontal lobe showed severe hemodynamic ischemia. The cerebral hemodynamics in patients with moyamoya disease improved after surgical intervention, especially in severely damaged patients. Split-dose (123)I-IMP SPECT was therefore found to be a useful diagnostic modality for quantifying the hemodynamics of moyamoya disease.
