Is it safe to include octogenarians at the start of a video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy programme? The study aimed to investigate the safety of including patients ≥ 80 years of age at the start of a video-assisted thoracic surgery major pulmonary resection (VMPR) programme.Patients were considered for VMPR if the computed tomography/positron emission tomography (CT/PET) was suggestive of T1-3, N0-1 and M0 lesion. Age was not a criterion for exclusion at the very start of the programme. Data were collected prospectively and comparison made between two groups, (A) <80 years of age and (B) ≥ 80 years, in terms of preoperative risk factors, oncological and functional data, operative results, postoperative complications and survival.Between April 2005 and January 2011, 200 consecutive patients were considered for VMPR. A total of 160 had non-small-cell lung cancer, of whom 136 were in group A, with a median age of 66.5 (range: 42.8-79.4 years) and 24 in group B with a median age of 82 (range: 80-85.5 years). In group B, 13 were men and 11 were women. Rate of conversion to thoracotomy was similar (3 (12.5%) in group B vs 17 (12.5%) in group A, p = 0.65), and so was the mean hospital stay (5.8 ± 3.3 days in group B vs 5.9 ± 4.6 days in group A, p = 0.899). Admission to intensive care unit and atrial fibrillation were significantly higher in octogenarians (six (25%) and six (25%) in group B vs eight (5.9%) and nine (6.6%) in group A, p = 0.008 and p = 0.012, respectively). There was significantly less mean days of air leak in octogenarians (0.06 ± 0.3 days in group B vs 2.8 ± 5.6 days in group A, p = 0.000). Otherwise, there were no age-related differences in relation to morbidity, mortality and the 3-year survival rate.Octogenarians undergoing VMPR have a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation and admission to the intensive care unit for cardiopulmonary support but otherwise are no different from younger age groups when it comes to rate of conversion to thoracotomy, hospital stay, morbidity and mortality. Age should not be an excuse to deny the elderly curative VATS resection. In our experience, accepting octogenarians early in the VMPR programme did not compromise the outcome results.
