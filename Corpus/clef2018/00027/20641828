( Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans that surround connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (1). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in inflammation and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (2). Invasive tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degrading the basement membrane and ECM (3). Several families of proteases are involved in atherogenesis, inflammation, myocardial infraction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastasis (4-8). The gelatinase family is a subgroup of MMPs consisting of gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) (9). Gelatinase expression in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages, is highly regulated. Elevated levels of gelatinases have been found in tumors that are associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (10). A number of synthetic MMP inhibitors have been developed to block the activated MMPs in pathological conditions (11). (
