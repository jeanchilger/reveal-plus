Antibiotic sensitivity patterns of Campylobacter jejuni/coli isolated from laboratory animals and pets. Fifty-four strains of Campylobacter jejuni/coli isolated from a variety of species of laboratory animals as well as pet dogs were tested by an agar dilution technique for susceptibility to each of 12 antimicrobial agents. Gentamicin and furazolidone were the most active of the drugs examined. The strains tested frequently were sensitive to two other aminoglycoside antibiotics, neomycin and kanamycin. Erythromycin also was effective at levels achievable in serum except in three strains which were resistant. Doxycycline and chloramphenicol were active against most strains, with 51 (96%) being susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. The minimal inhibitory concentrations were high for penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, metronidazole, and sulfadimethoxine.
