Cortical glucose metabolism in psychiatric wandering patients with vascular dementia. The cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglc) in 18 patients with vascular dementia (VD) and 15 age-matched normal subjects was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose technique. Nine of the 18 VD patients manifested abnormal wandering behavior with some psychiatric symptoms: they showed relatively spared CMRglc, which was higher than that of nonwandering patients, especially in the bilateral frontal lobes, left parietal lobe, left temporo-parieto-occipital region, left occipital lobe, and cerebellum. The results suggest that psychiatric wandering behavior of patients with VD could be correlated with partial sparing of CMRglc in the regions listed above.
