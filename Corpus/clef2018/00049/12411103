Contrast study on cognitive function with MRI and positron emission tomography imaging in transient global amnesia. To study cognitive function and cerebral metabolic changes in patients with transient global amnesia (TGA).Three patients with TGA were given mini-mental state examination (MMSE), revised Wechsler memory scale (WMS-R) examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans after they had been diagnosed as TGA. Using (18)F labelled deoxyglucose as tracer, patients were given a positron emission tomography (PET) examination at different periods during recovery.No obvious abnormality was found in MMSE and MRI scans in the three patients. However, WMS-R examination and cerebral PET imaging displayed cognitive dysfunction of varying degrees and low metabolism in local areas related to memory in 2 of 3 patients.In TGA patients, cognitive function and cerebral metabolic levels are closely correlated with duration of symptoms. It is necessary to stop the TGA attack as quickly as possible early time.
