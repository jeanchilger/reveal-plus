Regional brain glucose utilization in adenylosuccinase-deficient patients measured by positron emission tomography. Regional brain glucose utilization was investigated by positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose in three children with adenylosuccinase deficiency. A consistent pattern was found in the three patients, namely a marked decrease of fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in all gray structures, with the exception of the cerebellum, which was minimally affected. Anomalies predominated in the cerebral cortex, particularly in the anterior regions they were less pronounced in thalamus and basal ganglia. The observations suggest that positron emission tomography may be a useful tool for the localization of the deleterious effects of metabolic diseases and for the investigation of their pathophysiologic mechanisms.
