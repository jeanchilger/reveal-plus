Auditory cortex activity changes in long-term sensorineural deprivation during crude cochlear electrical stimulation: evaluation by positron emission tomography. We studied three right-handed human volunteers who have been prelingually deaf for 16 to 26 years. We measured cerebral regional activity (rA) using 15O labelled water and positron emission tomography (PET) during rest and during electrical cochlear stimulation of the right ear. The stimulus consisted of crude constant current squared pulses, it is currently employed in cochlear implant screening. Two subjects described a subjective auditory sensation under cochlear stimulation, the third did not. An increment of the rA (which is linked to the regional cerebral blood flow) in the auditory cortex was observed in all subjects, activation was ipsilateral to stimulation in one subject and contralateral in two subjects. These findings suggest 1) that auditory pathways to the cortex can remain functional a long time after prelinguistic auditory deprivation, 2) that the auditory cortex can be activated by a crude electrical stimulation of the cochlea in the absence of perception of the auditory stimulus, 3) that PET does not seem to offer any advantage for screening patients who have been prelingually deaf for a long time.
