Recurrent non-small cell lung cancer: evaluation of CT-guided radiofrequency ablation as salvage therapy. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a potential application as a salvage tool after failure of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although several studies have evaluated the use of RFA in primary NSCLC, there is little literature on its potential application as a salvage tool.To evaluate CT-guided RFA employed as a salvage therapy for pulmonary recurrences of NSCLC after prior treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery.A retrospective computer database search yielded 33 patients with biopsy proven primary NSCLC who underwent CT-guided RFA of 39 recurrent tumors following surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy. Follow-up imaging was performed with CT and PET-CT. The endpoints of interest were progression-free survival (PFS) and time to local progression (TTLP). PFS and TTLP were compared by lesion size (<3 cm, ≥3 cm).The median PFS was 8 months. For patients with a tumor size <3 cm median PFS was 11 months, whereas the median PFS of patients with a tumor size ≥3 cm was 5 months. The difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.09). The median TTLP of all tumors was 14 months. TTLP of ablated tumors <3 cm in size was 24 months, compared to 8 months for ablated tumors ≥3 cm in size. The difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07).RFA of recurrent NSCLC may be a valuable salvage tool to achieve local tumor control, especially in tumors measuring <3 cm in size.
