Cerebral blood volume, blood flow, and oxygen metabolism in cerebral ischaemia and subarachnoid haemorrhage: an in-vivo study using positron emission tomography. A characteristic sequence of metabolic and haemodynamic changes has been shown to occur in the brain as cerebral perfusion pressure is reduced in experimental animals. Increased cerebral blood volume (CBV) occurs initially, followed by a fall in blood flow (CBF) and, finally, a fall in oxygen metabolism (CMRO2). By measuring CBV, CBF, and CMRO2 with positron emission tomography in patients with vasospasm associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage and in patients with arteriosclerotic occlusion or stenosis of extraparenchymal cerebral arteries, we have demonstrated the presence of similar changes distal to such lesions in man. These findings suggest the presence of a local decrease in perfusion pressure. This study demonstrates the utility of positron emission tomography in the assessment of cerebral circulation and metabolism in man. Measurements of regional CBV must be included for a complete assessment of the dynamics of the cerebral circulation.
