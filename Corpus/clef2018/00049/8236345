Cerebral hypoperfusion in stroke prognosis and brain recovery. The value of acute cerebral blood flow measurements in stroke prognosis is controversial. No previous study has determined whether acute perfusion deficits independently add to a validated clinical prognostic score. We aimed to compare the value of acute hypoperfusion deficits with a quantitative clinical score in stroke prognosis and to correlate the changes in perfusion with brain recovery.Volumetric analysis of regional hypoperfusion was performed in 38 patients with middle cerebral infarction within 72 hours of onset by use of single photon emission computed tomography and 99mTc hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. Stroke severity was assessed by the Canadian Neurological Score and Barthel Index. Allen's prognostic score was determined acutely in all patients. Clinical outcome was evaluated in 36 of 38 patients, of whom 18 had repeat blood flow studies.Acute hypoperfusion correlated with both the outcome Barthel Index (P < .001, r = -.61) and Canadian Neurological Score (P < .001, r = -.64). Allen's score correlated better with both the outcome Barthel Index (P < .001, r = .80) and Canadian Neurological Score (P < .001, r = .81). Acute hypoperfusion deficits, after allowing for Allen's score, independently predicted neurological but not functional outcome. Despite overall neurological improvement, mean hypoperfusion increased on the repeat blood flow studies (P < .05).Volumetric analysis of acute regional hypoperfusion within 72 hours of onset predicts stroke outcome after 3 months, but Allen's score is a better prognostic method. Neurological recovery is not associated with chronic infarct reperfusion.
