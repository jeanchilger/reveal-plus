New imaging methods in diagnosis of lung cancer. The paper reviews new imaging methods allowing more precise diagnosing and staging of lung cancer. From among the methods currently used in clinical practice computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance were reviewed. Advantages and limitations of these techniques were presented. As for isotopic tests we reviewed single photon emission computed tomography and positron-emission tomography as well as novel endoscopic methods--lung imaging fluorescence bronchoscopy and video assisted thoracoscopy.
