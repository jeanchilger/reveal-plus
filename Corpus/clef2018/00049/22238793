VivoTag-S 750-( Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1 30 amino acids) is secreted from enteroendocrine cells of the distal small intestine in response to food ingestion (1). GLP-1 plays an important role in glucose metabolism and homeostasis by inhibiting gastric emptying, glucagon secretion, and glucose production (2). In addition, GLP-1 induces insulin release from the pancreatic β-cells as well as their proliferation. The GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has been identified in normal tissues such as the pancreatic β-cells, stomach, brain, and lung, and it has been shown to be highly overexpressed in human insulinomas and gastrinomas (3). In insulinomas, GLP-1R density is considerably greater, and the GLP-1R is more frequently observed than somatostatin receptors. Exendin-4 is a GLP-1 analog with 39 amino acids isolated from the venom of the Gila monster (
