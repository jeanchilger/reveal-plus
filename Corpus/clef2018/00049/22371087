Optimizing the role of FDG PET-CT for potentially operable metastatic colorectal cancer. Recent treatment advances now allow a realistic chance of cure in selected patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Accurate pre-treatment staging is crucial to ensure appropriate management by identification of patients with more advanced disease who will not benefit from surgery. (18)Fluorine 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) has a firmly established role in staging, restaging, and recurrence detection of a range of tumors. This article will review the role of PET-CT in patients with CRC with a particular emphasis on optimizing the technique in patients with potentially operable metastatic disease.
