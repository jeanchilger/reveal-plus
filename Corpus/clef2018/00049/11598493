Cerebral glucose transport implies individualized glial cell function. Previous positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of cerebral glucose transport using [11C]-3-O-methylglucose (CMG) suggested an interindividual variation in the values of the rate constant of tracer outflow (k2) larger than that for the clearance rate of inflow (K1). These two parameters were examined in healthy cerebral cortex by dynamic PET in 4 men and 2 women (aged 24 to 73 years) without neurologic disease, and in 1 man (42 years) with a recent left hemispheric cerebral infarction under normoglycemia (average blood plasma d-glucose concentration, 5.44 +/- 1.94 micromol/mL) and again under hyperglycemia (average, 10.24 +/- 1.44 micromol/mL). Time-radioactivity curves were obtained from healthy cortex (grey matter) and plasma and analyzed for the values of K1 and k2 by two graphical approaches and two fitting procedures. Both K1 and k2 significantly declined with increasing plasma glucose levels. A highly significant interindividual but not intraindividual variability for k2 was found at normoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The interindividual variability of K1, although borderline significant, was less than that of k2. Accordingly variable were the distribution volumes K1/k2. These data suggest individualized glial cell function and may be relevant to pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disease.
