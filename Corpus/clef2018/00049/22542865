Multimodality imaging in amyloidosis. Amyloidosis comprises a rare spectrum of protein deposition diseases that diffusely or focally affect any organ. Amyloid's variable clinical presentation and nonspecific disease course often cause it to evade early diagnosis. This pictorial essay aims to familiarize radiologists with the pathophysiology of amyloidosis, to describe the basic classifications of amyloidosis, and to use multimodality imaging to illustrate its varied appearance throughout the body. This review highlights the diagnostic challenge of interpreting radiographic studies in patients with hematologic malignancies and concurrent amyloidosis. Radiologists should consider amyloid in chronically ill patients or patients with hematologic malignancies who have unusual/unexpected imaging findings.
