Correlation between glucose transporter-1 expression and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography in lung cancer. The aim of this study was to determine if glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) expression correlates with (18)F-FDG ((18)F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) in lung cancer and to examine the similarities and differences between them.A total of 34 patients with resected primary lung cancers were investigated in this study. There were 17 adenocarcinomas, 12 squamous cell carcinomas, and 5 cancers of other cell types. Immunohistochemical Glut1 intensity was categorized into three groups: negative, positive, and strongly positive. Glut1 frequency was defined by the proportion of positive cells among all cancer cells, and it was graded on a semiquantitative scale as 0-100% in 10% increments. The data are expressed as the mean +/- SD.Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were 4.8 +/- 6.3 in "negative" Glut1 intensity cases, 4.7 +/- 3.1 in "positive" Glut1 intensity cases, and 11.2 +/- 5.2 in "strongly positive" Glut1 intensity cases. Although SUVmax correlated significantly with tumor size (correlation coefficient 0.58, P = 0.00033), Glut1 frequency did not correlate significantly with tumor size (correlation coefficient 0.18, P = 0.301). Cell type and cell differentiation correlated significantly with Glut1 expression and (18)F-FDG uptake.Glut1 expression correlates significantly with (18)F-FDG uptake. There are similarities in cell differentiation and cell type between Glut1 expression and (18)F-FDG uptake. (18)F-FDG uptake correlates significantly with tumor size, but Glut1 expression does not.
