Biomarkers associated with metastasis of lung cancer to brain predict patient survival. MicroRNAs influence cell physiology alteration in miRNA regulation can be implicated in carcinogenesis and disease progression. Generally, one miRNA is predicted to regulate several hundred genes, and as a result, miRNAs could serve as a better classifier than gene expression. We combine validated miRNA expression values with imaging features to classify NSCLC brain mets from non-brain mets and identify possible biomarkers of brain mets. This research involves comprehensive miRNA expression profiling, evaluation of normalisation techniques and combination of miRNA with imaging features FDG-PET/CT and CT Scan. The biomarkers were validated on an independent data set to predict potential brain mets.
