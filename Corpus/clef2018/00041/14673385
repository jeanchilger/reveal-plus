Giant cell arteritis: strategies in diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes current diagnostic assessments and therapeutic strategies in giant cell arteritis. Giant cell arteritis or temporal arteritis is a chronic vasculitis of large and medium-size vessels. Concurrent symptoms of proximal muscular ache and morning stiffness, polymyalgia rheumatica, are commonly seen. Recent investigations support the contention that polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis are two different expressions of the same underlying vasculitic disorder.The symptomatology of giant cell arteritis is quite varying. Recently a frequent occurrence of audiovestibular manifestations was demonstrated, which should be actively searched for in the clinical investigation. Although color Doppler ultrasound, MRI, and positron emission tomography have illustrated the widespread nature of giant cell arteritis, none of these techniques may currently replace temporal artery biopsy. Biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is a safe and simple procedure, and remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. The importance of long biopsies and meticulous histologic examination using sub-serial sectioning is emphasized. Numerous recent publications confirm the low diagnostic yield of a second, contralateral biopsy. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone in the treatment of giant cell arteritis. Although steroid treatment promptly eliminates symptoms of systemic inflammation, its effect on inflammatory morphology is delayed. Consequently, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies. The potential role of aspirin has recently been implicated.
