Imaging features of simultaneous occurrence of renal and pancreatic foreign body granuloma due to chronically retained gauze: a case report. Herein we are reporting a case of simultaneous occurrence of renal and pancreatic foreign body granuloma due to retained gauze. The different imaging features of the two lesions make correct preoperative diagnosis difficult. Foreign body granulomas due to retained surgical gauze or sponges should be considered in patients who have previous histories of operations and who also have a mass in the surgical bed. Simultaneous occurrence of foreign body granuloma away from primary surgical field is also possible.
