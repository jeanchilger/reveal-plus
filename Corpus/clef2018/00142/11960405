Is a dynamic MRI examination of the pancreas still necessary?. Evaluation of the diagnostic potential of a dynamic MR examination of the pancreas.Retrospective study on 49 patients who underwent MRI of the pancreas (2 insulinomas, 2 cystadenomas, 19 pancreatic carcinomas, 26 patients with chronic pancreatitis). Interpretation was done in two steps: Initial evaluation of T2-weighted TSE-sequences, T1-weighted gradient echo sequences before and after injection of Gadolinium-DTPA i. v. Afterwards, additional evaluation of a dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI series of the pancreas with four dynamic scans.Dynamic MR examination of the pancreas is useful in case of insulinomas. However, in case of pancreatic cancer an additional dynamic MR examination of the pancreas does not provide further clinically relevant information.In patients with a suspicion of pancreatic cancer, the injection of contrast material should preferably be used for the performance of a contrast-enhanced MR angiography at the expense of a dynamic MR examination.
