68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT uptake in spinal lesions and MRI correlation on a patient with neuroendocrine tumor: potential pitfalls. A 62-year-old female patient with suspected insulinoma underwent 68Ga DOTA-TATE PET/CT for characterization and staging. This demonstrated a focus of uptake in the pancreas and 3 foci of uptake in the spine. An MRI of the spine performed to further characterize the lesions revealed the presence of a meningioma and degenerative changes, both of which showed 68Ga DOTA-TATE uptake. A vertebral metastasis seen on PET was occult on CT and MRI. A vertebral hemangioma had no discrete tracer uptake. Awareness of sources of error in interpreting 68Ga DOTA-TATE scans is important in order to avoid pitfalls.
