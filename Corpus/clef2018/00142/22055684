Perfusion measurement of the whole upper abdomen of patients with and without liver diseases: initial experience with 320-detector row CT. To report initial experience of upper abdominal perfusion measurement with 320-detector row CT (CTP) for assessment of liver diseases and therapeutic effects.Thirty-eight patients who were suspected of having a liver disease underwent CTP. There were two patients with liver metastases, two with hemangiomas, and four with cirrhosis (disease group). CTP was repeated for four patients with cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after therapy. Hepatic arterial and portal perfusion (HAP and HPP) and arterial perfusion fraction (APF), and arterial perfusion (AP) of pancreas, spleen, stomach, and intra-portal HCC were calculated. For disease-free patients (normal group), the values were compared among liver segments and among pancreatic and gastric parts. The values were compared between groups and before and after therapy.No significant differences were found in the normal group except between APFs for liver segments 3 and 5, and fundus and antrum. Mean HAP and APF for the disease group were significantly higher than for the normal group. APF increased after partial splenic embolization or creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. HPP increased and AP of intra-portal HCC decreased after successful radiotherapy.320-Detector row CT makes it possible to conduct perfusion measurements of the whole upper abdomen. Our preliminary results suggested that estimated perfusion values have the potential to be used for evaluation of hepatic diseases and therapeutic effects.
