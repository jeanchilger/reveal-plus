Diagnosis of a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm using EUS-FNA. A woman in her 50s was found to have a pancreatic mass on abdominal ultrasound. The tumor measured 40 mm in diameter and included a cystic lesion and calcification. In this case, we suspected a diagnosis of solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) due to the findings observed on various images. However, we were unable to exclude the possibility that the lesion was a neuroendocrine tumor. Therefore, we performed endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). In addition, in order to confirm the diagnosis of SPN, we performed minimized resection (segmental pancreatectomy). Obtaining a definitive preoperative diagnosis of SPN using EUS-FNA can guide the surgical approach.
