Prediction of Progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment by Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarkers. For patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the likelihood of progression to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important not only for individual patient care, but also for the identification of participants in clinical trial, so as to provide early interventions. Biomarkers based on various neuroimaging modalities could offer complementary information regarding different aspects of disease progression. The current study adopted a weighted multi-modality sparse representation-based classification method to combine data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, from three imaging modalities: Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and florbetapir PET. We included 117 normal controls (NC) and 110 MCI patients, 27 of whom progressed to AD within 36 months (pMCI), while the remaining 83 remained stable (sMCI) over the same time period. Modality-specific biomarkers were identified to distinguish MCI from NC and to predict pMCI among MCI. These included the hippocampus, amygdala, middle temporal and inferior temporal regions for MRI, the posterior cingulum, precentral, and postcentral regions for FDG-PET, and the hippocampus, amygdala, and putamen for florbetapir PET. Results indicated that FDG-PET may be a more effective modality in discriminating MCI from NC and in predicting pMCI than florbetapir PET and MRI. Combining modality-specific sensitive biomarkers from the three modalities boosted the discrimination accuracy of MCI from NC (76.7%) and the prediction accuracy of pMCI (82.5%) when compared with the best single-modality results (73.6% for MCI and 75.6% for pMCI with FDG-PET).
