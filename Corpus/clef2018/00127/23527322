Florbetapir F 18 for brain imaging of β-amyloid plaques. Recent trends in neurodegeneration research have been aimed at developing new amyloid ligands for the neuroimaging of dementia. Among the positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers, fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 ((18)F-FDG) is the compound most widely used in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. However, this compound shows a level of specificity and sensitivity for early Alzheimer's disease detection that is lower than that provided by high-affinity ligands for β-amyloid (Aβ). Among the new widely available fluorine 18 ((18)F)-labeled Aβ ligands, florbetapir F 18 ((18))F-AV-45 Amyvid™) showed clear qualitative and quantitative correlations between in vivo PET imaging and postmortem histopathologic analysis of Aβ. Florbetapir F 18 stands out for its high Aβ affinity and its pharmacokinetic properties that allow 10-minute PET scan imaging within 90 minutes after administration (dose = 370 MBq). Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical studies. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of Aβ in the brain. It was then approved earlier this year by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
