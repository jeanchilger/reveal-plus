Serum NT pro-BNP: relation to systolic and diastolic function in cardiomyopathies and pericardiopathies. NT pro-BNP is a marker of systolic and diastolic dysfunction.To determine NT pro-BNP levels in patients with chagasic, hypertrophic, and restrictive heart diseases, as well as with pericardial diseases, and their relation to echocardiographic measurements of systolic and diastolic dysfunction.A total of 145 patients were divided into the following groups: 1) Chagas' heart disease (CHD)--14 patients 2) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)--71 patientsNT pro-BNP was increased (p < 0.001) in CHD (median = 513.8 pg/ml), HCM (median = 848 pg/ml), EMF (median = 633 pg/ml), CP (median = 568 pg/ml), and PE (median = 124 pg/ml), when compared with the control group (median = 28 pg/ml). No statistically significant differences were found between CP and EMF (p = 0.14). In the hypertrophic group, NT pro-BNP was correlated with left atrial size (r = 0.40 p < 0.001) and with E/Ea ratio (p < 0.01). In the restrictive group, there was a trend of correlation with E-wave peak velocity (r = 0.439NT pro-BNP is increased in the different cardiomyopathies and pericardial diseases and is correlated with the degree of systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
