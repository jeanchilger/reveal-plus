Epicardial progenitor cells in cardiac development and regeneration. The epicardium forms an epithelial layer on the surface of the heart. It is derived from a cluster of mesothelial cells, which is termed the proepicardium. The proepicardium gives rise not only to the epicardium but also to epicardium-derived cells. These cells populate the myocardial wall and differentiate into smooth muscle cells, fibroblast, and possibly endothelial cells. In this review, the formation of the proepicardium is discussed. Marker genes, suitable to identify these cells in the embryo and in the adult, are introduced. Recent evidence suggests that the PE is made up of distinct cell populations. These cell lineages can be distinguished on the basis of marker gene expression and differ in their differentiation potential. The role of the epicardium as a resource for cardiac stem cells and its importance in cardiac regeneration is also discussed.
