Venous thromboembolic disease. Venous thromboembolic disease is extremely common. Conventional treatment with anticoagulation alone aims to impede the progression of thrombus, and prevent recurrence and the development of pulmonary embolism. This is appropriate for most patients. However, in certain patient populations, this alone does not address the long-term complications of venous thromboembolic disease. Surgeons should be familiar with the surgical techniques that have been demonstrated to improve outcomes with low risk. Recent studies of catheter-directed thrombolysis have demonstrated its safety, efficacy, and possibly the superiority over standard treatment alone.
