High prevalence of anti-prothrombin antibody in patients with deep vein thrombosis. The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of lupus anticoagulant (LA) antibody and several antibodies for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE) (n = 48), cerebral thrombosis (CT, n = 30), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 22), and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP, n = 30). The presence of antibodies was examined by using the respective ELISA kits. LA was positive in 38.6% of patients with DVT/PE, suggesting that LA is one of the most important risk factors in DVT/PE. The highest prevalence of anti-beta(2) glycoprotein I (beta(2)GPI) IgG was in CT and SLE, followed by DVT, and none in ITP and healthy volunteers (control, n = 40), suggesting that it is related to thrombosis, particularly arterial thrombosis. The highest prevalence of anti-prothrombin (aPT) IgG antibody was in DVT, followed by CT and SLE, and none in ITP and the control, suggesting that it is related to thrombosis, especially venous thrombosis. The highest prevalence of antiphospholipid (aPL) IgG was in DVT, CT, and SLE, but 0% in ITP and control. On the other hand, aPL IgM, anti-annexin V IgG, and anti-annexin V IgM were positive in patients both with and without thrombosis, suggesting that they are not related to thrombosis. Our results indicated that among the anti-phospholipid antibodies, LA is the most sensitive marker for APS while anti-beta(2)GPI IgG, aPT IgG, and aPL IgG are risk factors for thrombosis. In particular, aPT IgG is a significant marker for DVT/PE.
