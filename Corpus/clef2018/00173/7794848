Obstetricians' views on prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy: 1980 compared with 1993. To examine the attitudes of obstetricians in England and Wales concerning prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy and to compare these with a similar survey carried out in 1980.Postal questionnaires, based on those used in 1980, were sent to a random sample of 555 nonacademic consultant obstetricians, 71% of whom replied.The proportion of consultant obstetricians with a conscientious objection to termination of pregnancy was the same in both surveys, although virtually all conscientious objectors said that they made an exception for serious fetal abnormality. A major change was in the proportion saying that they generally required an undertaking to terminate an affected pregnancy before proceeding with amniocentesis: 75% in 1980 compared with 34% in 1993. As in 1980, lower priority is given to telling women of negative test results than of positive. More obstetricians in 1993 are prepared to consider terminations later in pregnancy, both for fetal abnormality and for social reasons, than was the case in 1980, but many are not prepared to recommend termination as late in pregnancy as the law allows. In some cases this is due to misapprehensions about what is legal. There are particular problems concerning terminations for fetal anomalies that not all would consider serious. One in seven of the 1993 sample would not recommend termination for cystic fibrosis at any gestation. Only 13% would recommend termination for Down's syndrome beyond 24 weeks. There is a need not only for clarification of the law, but also of obstetrician's willingness to implement it.
