Overexpression of copper zinc superoxide dismutase impairs human trophoblast cell fusion and differentiation. The syncytiotrophoblast is the major component of the human placenta, involved in feto-maternal exchanges and secretion of pregnancy-specific hormones. Multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast arises from fusion of mononuclear cytotrophoblast cells. In trisomy 21-affected placentas, we recently have shown that there is a defect in syncytiotrophoblast formation and a decrease in the production of pregnancy-specific hormones. Due to the role of oxygen free radicals in trophoblast cell differentiation, we investigated the role of the key antioxidant enzyme, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, encoded by chromosome 21 in in vitro trophoblast differentiation. We first observed that overexpression of superoxide dismutase in normal cytotrophoblasts impaired syncytiotrophoblast formation. This was associated with a significant decrease in mRNA transcript levels and secretion of hCG and other hormonal markers of syncytiotrophoblast. We confirmed abnormal cell fusion by overexpression of green fluorescence protein-tagged superoxide dismutase in cytotrophoblasts. In addition, a significant decrease in syncytin transcript levels was observed in superoxide dismutase-transfected cells. We then examined superoxide dismutase expression and activity in isolated trophoblast cells from trisomy 21-affected placentas. Superoxide dismutase mRNA expression (P < 0.05), protein levels (P < 0.01), and activity (P < 0.05) were significantly higher in trophoblast cells isolated from trisomy 21-affected placentas than in those from normal placentas. These results suggest that superoxide dismutase overexpression may directly impair trophoblast cell differentiation and fusion, and superoxide dismutase overexpression in Down's syndrome may be responsible at least in part for the failure of syncytiotrophoblast formation observed in trisomy 21-affected placentas.
