Interphase cytogenetic analysis of single cell suspensions prepared from previously formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) provides a rapid and accurate method for the detection of chromosomal aneuploidy. We have developed a technique for the use of FISH on single cell suspensions produced from either formalin-fixed or paraffin-embedded tissues. Preparation of such tissues involves sequential rehydration, enzymatic digestion to release single nuclei, and hybridization with a fluorescently labeled chromosome-specific centromeric probe. In a clinical setting formalin-fixed tissue from many tissue types is readily available for additional retrospective study. FISH on formalin-fixed tissues is especially beneficial in follow-up studies of cases involving termination after prenatal diagnosis or patients with a malignant disease where previous routine cytogenetics established the chromosomal aneuploidy. The use of this technique eliminates the biases of cytogenetic analysis due to clonal selection in tissue culture, the low number of cells analyzed, and the restriction to only dividing cell populations. We have demonstrated that this application of interphase cytogenetics to the study of various formalin-fixed tissues is amenable to the detection of chromosomal aneuploidies and has specific advantages over cytogenetic analysis.
