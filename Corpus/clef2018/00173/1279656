Increased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin in compromised pregnancies other than for neural tube defects or Down syndrome. Intrauterine fetal death occurred in four women who were 'screen-positive' in a screening programme for neural tube defects (NTDs) and Down syndrome (DS). These women had very high levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) and maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin (MShCG). Therefore, we evaluated all 'screen-positive' women in whom both of these markers were greater than or equal to 2.0 multiples of the median. The cases fulfilling these criteria totalled 11, and only one of them had no complications. High concentrations of both MSAFP and MShCG in a number of these cases might have been caused by an increased placental volume, which, in turn, might have been induced by decreased perfusion of the placenta. We conclude that screening programmes wrongly determine a high risk of fetal NTD or DS if the concentrations of both these parameters are very high. Invasive diagnostic procedures should be avoided in these cases, particularly in view of the increased risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome.
