Failure of differentiation of the trophoblast in trisomy 21. The syncytiotrophoblast is the major component of the human placenta as it is involved in the feto-maternal exchanges and the secretion of pregnancy-specific hormones. In normal placenta, the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast is formed by fusion of mononuclear cytotrophoblast cells. In trisomy 21-affected placenta, we show that it exists a defect (or a delay) in the syncytiotrophoblast formation and a decrease of the production of pregnancy-specific hormones. We show that it is related to the over expression of the SOD-1 located on chromosome 21. These results will be of help for the understanding of maternal hormonal markers of fetal trisomy 21 and the consequences of the placental defects on the fetal development.
