Effect of maternal hepatitis B carrier status on first-trimester markers of Down syndrome. Up to 10% of women of reproductive age in our country are carriers of hepatitis B virus. This study examined whether maternal hepatitis B carrier status has any effect on markers used in first-trimester screening for Down syndrome. Records for 2 major Taiwanese hospitals were retrospectively examined to identify women with singleton pregnancies resulting in normal live births from June 2002 through 2008. Maternal hepatitis B data were used to define 3 groups: seronegative women, inactive carrier women, and active carrier women. Women with active or inactive carrier status were significantly older than seronegative women. The results of the study show that maternal hepatitis B carrier status does not influence first-trimester levels of maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (free beta-hCG) multiples of the median (MoM), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) MoM, and median fetal nuchal translucency and screening false-positive rate therefore, correction in the risk calculation algorithm for maternal hepatitis B carrier status is not necessary.
