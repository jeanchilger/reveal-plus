Medians and correction factors for biochemical and ultrasound markers in Chinese women undergoing first-trimester screening for trisomy 21. To establish normative values and distribution parameters of first-trimester maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and fetal nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in Chinese women and to examine the effects of covariates on their levels.Maternal serum free beta-hCG, PAPP-A and fetal NT were measured in 9762 women presenting for first-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome at 11 to 14 weeks of gestation. Individuals' markers were converted to multiples of the median (MoM) using expected medians estimated by performing a weighted regression analysis. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to assess the influence of maternal weight, parity, ethnicity, chorionicity in twin pregnancies, smoking, insulin-dependent diabetes and mode of conception on individual marker MoM levels.Both free beta-hCG and PAPP-A median values demonstrated an exponential relationship with gestational age in days. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that free beta-hCG MoM was statistically significantly dependent on maternal weight (P < 0.0001) and chorionicity in twin pregnancy (both monochorionic and dichorionic P < 0.0001), that PAPP-A MoM was dependent on maternal weight (P < 0.0001), parity (P < 0.0001), chorionicity in twin pregnancy (both monochorionic and dichorionic P < 0.0001) and mode of conception (P = 0.002), and that fetal NT-MoM was dependent on maternal weight (P = 0.0006) and mode of conception (P = 0.012).Normative values have been generated to allow conversion of NT, free beta-hCG and PAPP-A to their MoM equivalents and correction factors have been determined to adjust for maternal and pregnancy characteristics for use in ethnic Chinese women undergoing first-trimester screening for aneuploidy.
