Prognosis of prenatally diagnosed children with sex chromosome aneuploidy. Sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) occurs in about 1/250 amniocenteses, and the significance of the long-term prognosis of fetuses with SCA is of concern to prospective parents and health care providers. Longitudinal studies in an unselected group of newborn infants with SCA diagnosed postnatally have refuted allegations of mental retardation but have documented an increased risk for developmental problems. Of the 530 phone consultations with parents faced with a prenatal diagnosis of SCA, 68% continued the pregnancy. Twenty of the oldest subsequently born children (now 7-14 years old) were available for follow-up. In this small sample and age group, the propositi are progressing developmentally at a rate comparable to their sibs and are doing better at school and in peer relations than the SCA group diagnosed postnatally. Only 2 have documented IQs as low as 90. The documented IQs of the remainder, none of whom are sex chromosome mosaics, are all over 110. The parent population in this prenatally diagnosed group is unique and different from that of the postnatally diagnosed group in that over 85% of them are college graduates, often professionals, and upper socioeconomic individuals. The developmental competence of this SCA sample may be attributable to the supportive environment provided by these families, all of whom made a conscious decision to continue the pregnancy.
