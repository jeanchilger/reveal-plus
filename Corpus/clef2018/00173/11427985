Preimplantation genetic diagnosis: applications for molecular medicine. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is an alternative to prenatal diagnosis for the detection of genetic disorders. Tests are conducted on single cells biopsied from embryos before they are implanted, allowing the selection of unaffected embryos before a pregnancy has been established. Thus, the issue of pregnancy termination is circumvented. The use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis might have a significant impact on in vitro fertilization success rates as well as allowing the diagnosis of inherited disease.
