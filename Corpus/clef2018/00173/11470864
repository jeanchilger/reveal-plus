Vascular endothelial growth factor and placenta growth factor concentrations in Down's syndrome and control pregnancies. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placenta growth factor (PLGF) are considered to play important roles in angiogenesis and vascular permeability during placental development. Since trisomy 21 placentae show trophoblastic hypoplasia and hypovascularity, we investigated PLGF and VEGF synthesis in Down's syndrome pregnancies. Maternal serum was collected from 102 euploid and 24 trisomy 21 pregnancies between 15 and 20 weeks gestation and tested for these two factors by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Protein extracts from 15 normal and six trisomy 21 placentae were also tested. VEGF was not detected in maternal serum, while PLGF increased significantly with gestational age. Serum PLGF, transformed as a multiple of the gestational age median (MoM), in Down's syndrome pregnancies was significantly lower than in euploid controls (mean 0.67 +/- 0.043 MoM versus 1.00 +/- 0.047 MoM, analysis of variance F = 11.605, P < 0.001 ). Both VEGF and PLGF were detected in placental protein extracts without variation according to gestational age. Down's syndrome placentae had significantly less PLGF compared to normal placentae (Mann-Whitney, P < 0.05 ) but no difference was observed in placental VEGF content (Mann-Whitney, P = 0.94 ). Considering the biological properties of PLGF, this decrease may provide new insights into the mechanism(s) leading to the structural and functional anomalies described in trisomy 21 placentae.
