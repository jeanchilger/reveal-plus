Prenatal diagnosis of 46,XY/46,XX mosaicism: a case report. We report on the prenatal diagnosis of a fetus with 46,XY and 46,XX cell lines with a normal male phenotype. Cytogenetic and molecular studies ruled out the possibility of maternal cell contamination and showed that all the X chromosomes present in both fetal cell lines were derived from a single maternal X chromosome. This suggests 46,XY/46,XX mosaicism.
