New foetopathological section of the heart. Correlated to the ultrasonographic 4 Chamber view in fetuses. Our findings on hearts of trisomic 21 fetuses of a new minor cardiac anomaly, belonging to the atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) spectrum and the improved performances of the fetal ultrasound screening lend us to propose a new section, complementary to the standard cardiopathological examination. It would enable us to test the anatomic level of insertion of the atrioventricular valves of the crux of the heart. It consists of a section of the fetal hearts, fixed in formaldehyde, in a plane correlated to the plane of the fetal ultrasonographic four chamber view. Three hallmarks have been chosen because of their relevance and of their reproductibility in ultra sonography as well as in fetopathology: the apex and the inferior pulmonary veins. This additional section was realized on fetal hearts, regarded as "normal" with the standard pathologic examination, because of a lack of defect. It allowed us to detect a minor cardiac abnormality of the AVSD spectrum, frequent in the trisomic 21 fetuses, which we called: linear insertion of the atrio ventricular valves( LIAVV) without defect. Initially described on a series of Trisomic 21 fetal hearts, the LIAVV without defect has also been found in other fetuses with another pathology often associated with an anomaly of the AVSD spectrum. The possible detection of this abnormality in fetal cardiac ultrasound scanning justifies the use of this new anatomical technique. It also has to be included it in the full standard pathologic examination of the fetal hearts of all the abnormal fetuses.
