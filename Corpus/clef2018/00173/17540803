Circulating angiogenic factors in early pregnancy and the risk of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous preterm birth, and stillbirth. To estimate the relationship between maternal serum levels of placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) in early pregnancy with the risk of subsequent adverse outcome.A nested, case-control study was performed within a prospective cohort study of Down syndrome screening. Maternal serum levels of sFlt-1 and PlGF at 10-14 weeks of gestation were compared between 939 women with complicated pregnancies and 937 controls. Associations were quantified as the odds ratio for a one decile increase in the corrected level of the analyte.Higher levels of sFlt-1 were not associated with the risk of preeclampsia but were associated with a reduced risk of delivery of a small for gestational age infant (odds ratio [OR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.96), extreme (24-32 weeks) spontaneous preterm birth (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.99), moderate (33-36 weeks) spontaneous preterm birth (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.98), and stillbirth associated with abruption or growth restriction (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.95). Higher levels of PlGF were associated with a reduced risk of preeclampsia (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90-0.99) and delivery of a small for gestational age infant (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99). Associations were minimally affected by adjustment for maternal characteristics.Higher early pregnancy levels of sFlt-1 and PlGF were associated with a decreased risk of adverse perinatal outcome.
