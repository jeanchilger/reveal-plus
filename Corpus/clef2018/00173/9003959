ACOG educational bulletin. Maternal serum screening. Number 228, September 1996 (replaces no. 154, April 1991). Committee on Educational Bulletins of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Maternal serum screening offers women the ability to increase the detection of open fetal defects, Down syndrome, and trisomy 18. After being informed of the risks and advantages of serum screening, a patient may elect to be screened. Counseling must emphasize that serum screening for these disorders is voluntary, and patients must be aware that further evaluation, if their results are classified as positive, may include amniocentesis. Physicians should have access to genetic services and reliable laboratories to assist them in the management of maternal serum screening and genetic procedures. Special attention must be given to the older gravida to help her make an appropriate personal decision regarding screening and genetic testing. Patients receiving positive results from a definitive test (karyotype or, possibly, ultrasonography) should have access to adequate counseling, including the availability of support groups and pediatric surgeons.
