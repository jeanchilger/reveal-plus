Elevated second-trimester human chorionic gonadotropin and subsequent pregnancy-induced hypertension. Pregnancy-induced hypertension is believed to be a disorder of the vascular endothelium, possibly focused in the placenta. Markers such as cellular fibronectin appear early in patients in whom pregnancy-induced hypertension develops. We hypothesized that patients with elevated second-trimester levels of human chorionic gonadotropin would have an increased risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension.We conducted a cohort study, using a database of patients undergoing second-trimester serum screening for Down syndrome and who were delivered at our institution between January 1990 and August 1991. We included all 180 women with human chorionic gonadotropin levels > or = 2.0 multiples of the median. A sequential sample of 369 women with levels < 2.0 multiples of the median served as the referent group. Standard American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists definitions of pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria were used.Patients with elevated human chorionic gonadotropin levels were at increased risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension (risk ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.4) and proteinuric pregnancy-induced hypertension (risk ratio 5.1, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 16.2). Adjusting for potential confounding factors did not alter these associations.Patients with elevated human chorionic gonadotropin appear to be at higher risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuric pregnancy-induced hypertension. Second-trimester human chorionic gonadotropin levels should be further investigated as a potential marker for pregnancy-induced hypertension.
