Germ-cell nondisjunction in testes biopsies of men with idiopathic infertility. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been used in combination with testicular sperm extraction to achieve pregnancies in couples with severe male-factor infertility, yet many of the underlying genetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. To investigate nondisjunction in mitotic and meiotic germ cells, we performed three-color FISH to detect numeric chromosome aberrations in testicular tissue samples from infertile men confirmed to have impaired spermatogenesis of unknown cause. FISH was employed to determine the rate of sex-chromosome aneuploidy in germ cells. Nuclei were distinguished as haploid or diploid, respectively. The overall incidence of sex-chromosome aneuploidy in germ cells was found to be significantly higher (P<.00001) in all three abnormal histopathologic patterns (range 39.0%-43.5%) as compared with normal controls (29.1%). The relative ratio of normal to aneuploid nuclei in the diploid cells of patients with impaired spermatogenesis was approximately 1.0, a >300% decrease when compared with the 4.42 ratio detected in patients with normal spermatogenesis. These results provide direct evidence of an increased incidence of sex-chromosome aneuploidy observed in germ cells of men with severely impaired spermatogenesis who might be candidates for ICSI with sperm obtained directly from the testis. The incidence of aneuploidy was significantly greater among the diploid nuclei, which suggests that chromosome instability is a result of altered genetic control during mitotic cell division and proliferation during spermatogenesis.
