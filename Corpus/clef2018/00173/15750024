Evidence for high frequency of chromosomal mosaicism in spontaneous abortions revealed by interphase FISH analysis. Numerical chromosomal imbalances are a common feature of spontaneous abortions. However, the incidence of mosaic forms of chromosomal abnormalities has not been evaluated. We have applied interphase multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization using original DNA probes for chromosomes 1, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y to study chromosomal abnormalities in 148 specimens of spontaneous abortions. We have detected chromosomal abnormalities in 89/148 (60.1%) of specimens. Among them, aneuploidy was detected in 74 samples (83.1%). In the remaining samples, polyploidy was detected. The mosaic forms of chromosome abnormality, including autosomal and sex chromosomal aneuploidies and polyploidy (31 and 12 cases, respectively), were observed in 43/89 (48.3%) of specimens. The most frequent mosaic form of aneuploidy was related to chromosome X (19 cases). The frequency of mosaic forms of chromosomal abnormalities in samples with male chromosomal complement was 50% (16/32 chromosomally abnormal), and in samples with female chromosomal complement, it was 47.4% (27/57 chromosomally abnormal). The present study demonstrates that the postzygotic or mitotic errors leading to chromosomal mosaicism in spontaneous abortions are more frequent than previously suspected. Chromosomal mosaicism may contribute significantly to both pregnancy complications and spontaneous fetal loss.
