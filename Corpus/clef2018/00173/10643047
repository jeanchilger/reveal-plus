The characteristics of the distribution of HLA antigens in the families of children with aneuploid chromosomal pathology. Search of possible immunogenetic markers of tendency to form aneuploid offspring was carried out. We have studied HLA-antigens distribution among families with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome children and among families with miscarriages. The disposition to reproduction of affected offspring is associated with following HLA-antigens: B40, B41 and B51. The most typical haplotypes among families with affected offspring were: A2B27, A2B40, A2B51, A9B51, A10B8, A10B40. The HLA-antigens distribution among families with miscarriages supports evidence, that certain haplotypes can contribute to aneuploidy in progeny.
