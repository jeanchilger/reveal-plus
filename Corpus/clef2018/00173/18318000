First trimester screening for Down syndrome in rhesus negative women. To explore the effect of maternal rhesus status on first-trimester screening markers for Down syndrome.We accessed a database of singleton pregnancies undergoing first-trimester genetic screen with maternal Rh status documented and pregnancy outcome information available. Excluded were cases of fetal chromosomal or structural abnormalities, or maternal systemic disease. Results of maternal serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG) adjusted for gestational age were compared between Rh-negative and Rh-positive women with p < 0.05 considered significant.Two thousand two hundred and two pregnancies fulfilled the study criteria, and 160 of them (7%) were Rh negative. Only free beta-hCG corrected multiples of the median (MoM) values were statistically increased in Rh-negative women (p < 0.009). Using a cut-off of 1:300, screen-positive rates of maternal serum biochemistry were not significantly different between Rh-negative and Rh-positive women (12.5 vs 10.4%, p = 0.41).The present study focused on measurements of beta-hCG and PAPP-A in the sera of women with Rh-negative blood group. Women with Rh-negative blood type have similar first-trimester serum PAPP-A MoM values as Rh-positive women, but significantly higher beta-hCG MoM values. However, there was no significant difference in the screen-positive rate for Down syndrome between the two groups.
