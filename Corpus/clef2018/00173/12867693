Prenatal diagnosis of partial trisomy 21 associated with maternal balanced translocation 46xx der 21 t(21q22q) with pericentric inversion of chromosome 9. This communication reports prenatal diagnosis of partial trisomy 21 resulting from balanced translocation (21q22q) in a 36-year-old gravida 7, para 1 woman. The lady had only one living child and there was history of recurrent spontaneous first trimester abortions. Triple test was abnormal in the present conception. In addition, the woman had pericentric inversion of chromosome 9, a finding scarcely reported previously with carrier status in Indian literature. A few cytogeneticists consider this as a normal variant. However, many reports in the recent literature link pericentric inversion of chromosome 9 with infertility, recurrent abortions and a number of other abnormal conditions. A review of the relevant literature pertinent to the case is provided.
