Has prenatal ultrasonic diagnosis modified the prognosis of intestinal atresia? Results of a multicenter study. A multicentric investigation concerning intestinal atresia diagnosed in french university hospitals from 1979 to 1983, has been done. Out of 96 exploitable cases coming from 8 centers, 28 correspond to intestinal atresias which had subject to prenatal echographic diagnosis: that is 29%. 15 of the 96 atresias were affected with trisomy. 21 which had not been recognised in utero. Concerning the isolated duodenal atresia, not accompanied by any other malformation, the post surgical evolution has been appreciated during the 12 months following the surgical operation. There was no statistically significant difference, in favour of the group of children whose malformation has been recognised in utero, concerning the number of post surgical complications. This result, apparently deceitful, can be explained by the early management of these malformations in specialised centers which have participated in this study.
