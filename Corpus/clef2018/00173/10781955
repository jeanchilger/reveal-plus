Regional and cellular specificity of the expression of TPRD, the tetratricopeptide Down syndrome gene, during human embryonic development. The TPRD gene (tetratricopeptide (TPR) containing Down syndrome gene) is one of the candidate genes in the Down syndrome chromosomal region-1. Duplication of this gene may be the cause of major phenotypic features of Down syndrome. Here we show that the TPRD expression is developmentally regulated during human embryogenesis. At the earliest stages of development (Carnegie 8-12) TPRD expression is ubiquitous. At later developmental stages (Carnegie stages 14, 16 and 18), it becomes restricted to the nervous system, as is the case for the mtprd gene during mouse development. We extended our analysis of TPRD expression during fetal development of the human nervous system (13, 22 and 24 weeks). A new oblique illumination technique was used to compare signal intensity and cell density. Some regions of the nervous system such as the external cortical layers of the brain, and the inner neuroblastic layer of the eye, strongly express the TPRD gene.
