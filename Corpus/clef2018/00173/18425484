Quantification of circulatory fetal DNA in the plasma of pregnant women. The analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in the circulation of the pregnant woman plays the pivotal role in noninvasive prenatal research. Here, we describe an improved method for the quantification of male DNA, which is a valuable research tool for the quantification of fetal DNA. The quantification of fetal DNA serves two main purposes. First, the levels may indicate certain pregnancy-related disorders such as preeclampsia even before onset of the disease thus, the quantification may serve as a marker for early detection. Second, extraction and enrichment strategies of the fetal DNA compartment are important factors in the development and implementation of clinical tests, such as detection of fetal sex, Rhesus D status, point mutations, and aneuploidies. In this context, the quantification of fetal DNA is an important tool for the evaluation of protocols.
