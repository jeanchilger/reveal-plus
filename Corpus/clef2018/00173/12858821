Fetal abnormalities leading to termination of pregnancy: the experience at the Assaf Harofeh Medical Center between the years 1999-2000. To assess the distribution of fetal indications leading to termination of pregnancy.A retrospective study.The study included all parturient women with singleton pregnancy, who underwent termination of pregnancy due to fetal abnormalities (structural, chromosomal/genetic, infections). The women were subdivided into two groups according to their gestational age, i.e. early termination (gestational period < 23 weeks) and late termination (gestational period > 23 weeks).A total of 137 terminations of pregnancies were performed, including 102 early terminations and the rest--late terminations. The mean maternal age was 31 +/- 5 years. The termination procedures were performed at a mean gestational age of 20 +/- 5 weeks. The main indications in the early-termination subgroup were structural and chromosomal/genetic (n = 45, 44% for each subgroup). Multiple abnormalities were more common in the early-termination group (18% versus 7%). In the late-termination subgroup the leading indications were structural anomalies (n = 29, 83%) that were subdivided into neurological defects (31%) followed by skeletal deformities (23%). In addition, in the late-termination subgroup there were more cardiac and urinary tract defects (17% versus 11% and 14% versus 9%, respectively). Among the chromosomal aneuploidies, trisomy 21 was diagnosed in 24 cases (53%). Fetal infections were diagnosed in 13 pregnancies (9%), with only one of these detected in advanced gestation. The leading infectious agent was cytomegalovirus.In the early-termination subgroup the main indications were equally divided between structural and chromosomal/genetic defects while in the late-termination subgroup the leading cause was structural defects.
