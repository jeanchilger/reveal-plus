Increased risk of aneuploidy in women having unsuccessful chorionic villus sampling procedures. To determine the incidence of fetal aneuploidy in women who had unsuccessful chorionic villus sampling (CVS) procedures.Retrospective study.Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.Two thousand six hundred and sixty-eight women who underwent chorionic villus sampling, in 78 (2.9%) of whom villi could not be obtained.Sixty-nine of 78 (88%) women who had an unsuccessful CVS procedure underwent a subsequent amniocentesis later in the same pregnancy.The incidence of aneuploidy identified from amniotic fluid chromosome analysis in the 69 women who had an unsuccessful CVS procedure compared to the frequency of aneuploidy in women having a successful CVS procedure.Of the 69 women who underwent a post-CVS amniocentesis because of failure to obtain chorionic villi, six aneuploid pregnancies were identified (8.7%). The frequency of aneuploidy in the 2590 successfully sampled CVS patients was 2.5%. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.009) by Fisher's exact test (two-tailed).Women having an unsuccessful CVS procedure should be informed that they may be at increased risk for carrying an aneuploid fetus.
