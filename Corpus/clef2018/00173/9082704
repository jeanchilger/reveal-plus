HELLP syndrome in the 21st week of pregnancy in mosaic trisomy 9. We report for the first time the case of postabortional HELLP-syndrome in the 21st week of gestation. In this case mosaic trisomy 9 was confirmed by amniocentesis prior to induction. Pertinent history, clinical course and pathoanatomical morphology are described. We emphasize the early onset of the HELLP-syndrome in association with trisomy 9 after abortion. The possibility of interconnections between trisomy 9 and the occurrence of HELLP-syndrome (sparse blood, vessels in the villi, circulatory deficit on the fetal side of the placenta, increased production of e.g. vasopressive substances) is discussed.
