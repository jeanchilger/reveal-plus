Pregnancy outcome in 1,252 fetuses after nuchal translucency measurement in the 1st trimester. The measurement of the nuchal translucency is an important marker to detect a vast number of fetal anomalies. Lately the nuchal translucency has been used increasingly as a screening method to find chromosomal anomalies especially for trisomy 21. Beside a high incidence of chromosomal defects one assumes a high risk of rare syndromes and other associated anomalies such as heart defects, skeletal anomalies, cerebral anomalies, diaphragmatic hernias, as well as of an intrauterine death. In view of abortion rate, detection rate of chromosomal anomalies, other fetal anomalies and rare syndromes we evaluated in this study the pregnancy outcome after nuchal translucency measurement, and discuss a concept for its management.
