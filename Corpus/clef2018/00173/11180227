Highly abnormal cleavage divisions in preimplantation embryos from translocation carriers. We have developed preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for carriers of chromosomal abnormalities using fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). Here we present the detailed analysis of 64 biopsied, normally developing embryos obtained from four Robertsonian and three reciprocal translocation carriers in 11 treatment cycles of which four resulted in normal pregnancies (three simplex, one duplex). In order to investigate the degree of mosaicism and segregation mode in the embryos, the primary analysis of the biopsied cells was extended with the analysis of all cells from the non-transferred embryos. The analysis also included a second hybridisation with two additional probes, not involved in the translocation (chromosomes 1 and 9), in order to investigate the overall degree of mosaicism. Seventeen out of 64 analysed embryos were balanced for the chromosomes involved in the translocation and 14 of these were transferred. Forty-seven out of 64 embryos (73%) were mosaic regarding the chromosomes involved in the translocation and alternate segregation mode was the most common mode of segregation. Moreover, we have found a higher degree of mosaicism for the chromosomes involved in translocations as compared to control chromosomes. This difference was more pronounced for the embryos from reciprocal translocation carriers. The results, mechanisms, significance and implications of our findings are discussed.
