Different policies on prenatal ultrasound screening programmes and induced abortions explain regional variations in infant mortality with congenital malformations. To compare the impact of induced abortions (IA) on the mortality of infants with congenital malformations in four European regions with different policies on IA and prenatal ultrasound screening for congenital malformations.A registry-based collection of data on congenital malformations in four different countries: Ireland (Dublin), Denmark (Funen County), Austria (Styria), and France (Strasbourg).The proportion of infant deaths with malformations ranged from 23 to 44% of all infant deaths with the highest proportion in Dublin, where IA is not allowed and prenatal ultrasound screening not performed. There were highly significant differences in the prevalences of IA (p < 0.001), fetal deaths (p < 0.01), and deaths in infants with congenital malformations (p < 0.001) between the four regions. The differences in total mortality with congenital malformations (IA + fetal deaths + infant deaths) between regions decreased, and only Strasbourg differs significantly from the other three regions.Prenatal ultrasound screening programmes have only a minor impact on total mortality with congenital malformations from 2nd trimester of pregnancy to 1 year of age, but seem to change the time of death which may be important for both the parents and the community.
