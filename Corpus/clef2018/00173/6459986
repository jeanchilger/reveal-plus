Paternal age and Down's syndrome: data from prenatal diagnoses (DFG). From prenatal diagnosis data obtained on mothers aged 35 years and above in the Federal Republic of Germany (DFG data), older fathers are demonstrated to have an increased risk of having trisomy 21 offspring. For paternal ages of 41 years upward, the age effect is quite strong. The risk for a fetus to have any de novo chromosomal aberration increases more with advancing paternal age for older mothers than for younger ones. Thus the ages of both parents have to be taken into account as an indication for prenatal diagnosis. Risk figures for trisomy 21 and for any de novo chromosomal aberration are given, together with preliminary recommendations for prenatal diagnosis for different combinations of parental ages.
