Karyotyping of fetuses with developmental disorders. A 5-year material 1985-89. During the period 1985 to 1989 foetal chromosomal analysis was performed in 121 of 318 pregnant women with foetal malformations detected by ultrasound. There were six failures. The percentage of foetuses karyotyped for developmental disorders increased from 13% in 1985 to 62% in 1989. An abnormal chromosomal pattern was found in 28 (24%) of the foetus. The pregnancy was terminated in 86% of cases with abnormal karyotype. The corresponding number in the group with normal chromosomes was 51%. The authors discuss the malformations leading to karyotyping, the methods used for karyotyping, the results of these tests and the consequences for the pregnancies.
