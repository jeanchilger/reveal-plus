Chromosome mosaicism of the placenta--a cause of developmental failure of the fetus? Fourteen (2.5 per cent) of 568 chromosome preparations after CVS showed discrepancies between the placental and fetal karyotype, mainly due to placental mosaicism. The presence of a second cell line within the placenta was confirmed in all but one case, in which cytogenetic reinvestigations were carried out. Our clinical data indicate that severe developmental retardation in the newborn is not to be expected if only the placenta carries the chromosomally abnormal cell line.
