The dilemma of a low rate of chromosomal mosaicism found in fetal blood sampling. We report a case in which mosaicism of trisomy 13 was detected in 4/10 cells (40 per cent) in amniotic fluid cell cultures, followed by a low rate of mosaicism (1/160 cells) detected in a fetal blood sample. This finding presents a dilemma both for the genetic counsellor and for the parents in determining whether or not to terminate the pregnancy.
