Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against pregnancy-associated plasma protein A. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) was found to be a good first trimester maternal serum marker, together with free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) subunits, for the biochemical screening of fetal trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome). We have raised monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PAPP-A purified from human pregnancy serum. The different antibodies were characterized biochemically by Western blot analysis and in terms of specificity (reaction with non-pregnant and male serum). Their performance in Down's syndrome screening was assessed in comparison with an existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method after labelling of the different mAbs with biotin or horseradish peroxidase. A pair of mAbs was eventually chosen for a double-antibody sandwich protocol. The selected combination was found to have a significantly increased specificity (P = 0.0116) over the method using (purified) polyclonal antibodies, together with slightly increased sensitivity. In our limited number of Down's syndrome pregnancy samples (n = 17) and controls (n = 18), the medians as well as the multiples of the median values (for the affected cases) were comparable between the two methods described.
