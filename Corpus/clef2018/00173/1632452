Prenatal diagnosis of the Pallister-Killian mosaic aneuploidy syndrome by CVS. Prenatal cytogenetic analysis at 11 weeks of gestation revealed an abnormal karyotype 47,XX,+mar in all metaphases obtained from a chorionic villi sample after 24 h culture. Karyotyping of amniotic fluid cells in the second trimester showed mosaicism 47,XX,+i(12p)/46,XX with 10% aneuploid cells. The pregnancy was terminated at 20 weeks of gestation on the patient's request. The aborted fetus showed typical manifestations of the Pallister-Killian mosaic aneuploidy syndrome. The identity of the supernumerary isochromosome 12p was proven by LDH isozyme electrophoresis using cultured fibroblasts and by nonradioactive in situ hybridization using a biotinylated set of chromosome 12-specific DNA probes.
