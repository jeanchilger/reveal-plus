Cloning a new human gene from chromosome 21q22.3 encoding a glutamic acid-rich protein expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. The identification and functional characterization of genes on chromosome 21 is a necessary step to understand the pathogenesis of the various phenotypic anomalies that affect Down syndrome patients. Using direct cDNA selection we have identified a new gene, SH3BGR, that maps to 21q22.3, proximal to HMG14, and is differentially expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. SH3BGR encodes a novel protein that is characterized by the presence of a proline-rich region containing the consensus sequence for a SH3-binding domain and by an acidic carboxyl-terminal region containing a glutamic acid-rich domain predicted to assume a coiled coil. The presence of two functional domains involved in protein-protein interactions suggests that SH3BGR could be part of a multimeric complex. Its overexpression might alter specific functions of muscular tissue and therefore take part in the pathophysiology of muscular hypotonia in Down syndrome.
