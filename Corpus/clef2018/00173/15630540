Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation) with multiple extrapulmonary anomalies: autopsy report of a fetus at 19 weeks of gestation. Congenital pulmonary airway malformation, or congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, is postulated to be a disorder of pulmonary airway morphogenesis and encompasses 5 different types with distinct levels or stages of tracheobronchial development. We present a unique case of type 2 congenital pulmonary airway malformation with a previously undocumented combination of multiple extrapulmonary anomalies, featuring ipsilateral multicystic renal dysgenesis, contralateral renal agenesis, and ovarian germ cell hypoplasia, diagnosed in a 19-week gestational age fetus by autopsy. Epithelial cells comprising the pulmonary lesions were positive for thyroid transcription factor-1, surfactant protein-B, and cytokeratin-7 but negative for cytokeratin-20 immunostainings, with the pattern seen in normal terminal bronchioles. Chromosomal analysis showed a normal female karyotype, despite a high estimated risk for Down syndrome suggested by the low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level.
