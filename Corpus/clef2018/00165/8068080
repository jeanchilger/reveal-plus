A case of chronic epileptic encephalopathy of neonatal onset. A probable concern of human cytomegalovirus. A 10-year-old male patient, who had suffered from intractable convulsions from the neonatal period, is presented. Serial brain images suggested slow, gradual destruction of neural elements. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA was detected in his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by means of the polymerase chain reaction. Intrathecal interferon had a favorable effect on his seizures. We assume a close relationship between HCMV and some chronic types of epileptic encephalitis/encephalopathy.
