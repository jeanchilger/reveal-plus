The viral bronchiolites diagnosis in children by PCR multiplex. The aim of the study was to determine the etiology of the viral bronchiolites in children by using direct immunofluorescence test and 3 RT-PCR Multiplex (S.Bellau-Pujol) The study was performed on 122 nasal inspirations collected from 3 weeks-6 month old children hospitalizated in the pediatrics service of CH Rouen. The results were that the majority (53%) of bronchiolites in children had like etiology RSV and a lot of these infections had double viral etiology (26% RSV+ Rhinovirus 2,7% RSV+HMPV and 1% RSV+Coronavirus 229E). An important viral factor which gives bronchiolitis in children is HMPV (11%). We also find respiratory infections with triple viral etiology: RSV+Influenza A virus + Rhinovirus.
