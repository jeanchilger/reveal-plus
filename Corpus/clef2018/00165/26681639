Development of a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of congenital human cytomegalovirus infection in urine samples. A TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), based on amplification of HCMV UL54 gene specific sequence, was developed and compared with shell vial viral culture assay, the gold standard technique for the diagnosis of congenital HCMV infection, using urine samples collected from 110 newborns. The results indicate that this qPCR is slightly more sensitive than shell vial assay suggesting that qPCR may be considered a useful alternative for diagnosing congenital HCMV infection.
