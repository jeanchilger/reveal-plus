Comparison of streptococci of serological group B isolated from healthy carriers and active disease in Chile. Serotyping of 50 streptococcal strains of serological group B isolated from human clinical specimens in Chile revealed mainly the serotypes Ia, II and III, either alone or in combination with protein antigens c or R. No significant difference in serotype distribution was detected between group B streptococci isolated from cervical swabs from clinically healthy women and those isolated from various pathological processes. Determination of antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria demonstrated resistance to tetracycline and minocycline in 29 isolates. All 29 tetracycline-resistant cultures hybridised with a gene probe for tet(M). Again, no differences were detected between the group B streptococcal isolates of various origins.
