Clinical performance of a rapid influenza test and comparison of nasal versus throat swabs to detect 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection in Thai children. We identified febrile pediatric outpatients seeking care for influenza like illness in Bangkok. Two nasal and 1 throat swab were tested using the QuickVue A+B rapid influenza kit and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Among 142 pandemic influenza A (H1N1)-positive patients, the QuickVue test identified 89 positive tests for a sensitivity of 62.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 54.7-70.6). Specificity was 99.2% (95% CI: 98-100). In the 0 to 2 years age group, sensitivity was 76.7% (95% CI: 61.5-91.8). Throat and nasal swabs are equally useful diagnostic specimens for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction diagnosis.
