Colony morphology switching of Candida lusitaniae and acquisition of multidrug resistance during treatment of a renal infection in a newborn: case report and review of the literature. Candida lusitaniae is an emerging opportunistic pathogen which exhibits an unusual antifungal susceptibility pattern. We describe a case of fatal renal infection due to C. lusitaniae in a very low birth weight neonate who was treated with short courses of fluconazole given alternately with amphotericin B. A colony morphology switching was detected on the standard primary culture medium by changes in colony size. Switching was shown to affect deeply the susceptibility to amphotericin B. Afterwards, the switched phenotype developed a cross resistance to fluconazole and itraconazole. Several issues raised by this case are discussed in the light of an extensive review of the literature. Our observations point out the importance of both the detection of colony morphology switching and the close monitoring of antifungal susceptibility in the management of infections due to C. lusitaniae. A judicious therapeutic strategy should prevent the acquisition of multidrug resistance during antifungal therapy.
