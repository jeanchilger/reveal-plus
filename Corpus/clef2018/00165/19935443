Human rhinovirus causes severe infection in preterm infants. Data of 11 infants (median gestational age and birth weight 30 weeks and 1520 g, respectively) with severe human rhinovirus infection (HRV) are described. Nine of 11 (82%) were preterm infants and 7 of these 9 (78%) became infected during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. All infants presented with respiratory distress and all needed respiratory support for a median of 6 days. Radiologic findings included perihilar streakiness, atelectasis, focal consolidation, and hyperinflation. The diagnosis of HRV infection was made by real-time polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal aspirate. All infants recovered from their HRV infection. HRV can cause severe disease in preterm infants requiring respiratory support.
