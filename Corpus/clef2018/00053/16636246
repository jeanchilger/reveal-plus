Annexin V SPECT imaging of phosphatidylserine expression in patients with dementia. The authors sought to use radiolabeled annexin V, a marker of phosphatidylserine expression, to image Alzheimer dementia (AD). Four of five patients with AD had multifocal cortical annexin V uptake, whereas all seven non-AD and six control patients had normal SPECT. The mean cortex/cerebellar activity in patients with AD (1.4 +/- 0.6) was higher than that of non-AD dementia patients (0.7 +/- 0.2 p = 0.02). Radiolabeled annexin V may be useful for imaging AD.
