Metabolic and hemodynamic evaluation of brain metastases from small cell lung cancer with positron emission tomography. Brain metastases from small cell lung cancer respond to chemotherapy, but response duration is short and the intracerebral concentration of chemotherapy may be too low because of the characteristics of the blood-brain barrier. Positron emission tomography has been applied in a variety of tumors for studies of metabolic and hemodynamic features. This study was performed to determine regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in brain metastases from small cell lung cancer and the surrounding brain. Tumor rCMRglu, rCBF, and rCBV exerted a broad variability, but were higher than the corresponding values in white matter and higher than or similar to those of gray matter. Tumor rCMRglu and rCBF were highly correlated (P < 0.01, r = 0.79). No correlation between survival and metabolic or hemodynamic parameters could be demonstrated. After radiotherapy, mean tumor rCMRglu decreased from 0.40 to 0.31 micromol/g/min (not significant), and rCBF and rCBV remained unchanged. However, cortical rCBF demonstrated a trend of increased values after radiotherapy from 0.37 to 0.49 ml/g/min (P = 0.13). No change in rCMRglu was observed in gray or white matter after radiotherapy. Global CBF seems to be reversibly depressed by the metastases, but local hemodynamic changes in the tumor could not be detected with positron emission tomography in this study. An association between high tumor rCMRglu and rCBF as an indicator of hypoxia was not observed. Other methods for noninvasive in vivo analysis of tumor hemodynamics are needed, especially for discrimination between tumor necrosis and hypoxia.
