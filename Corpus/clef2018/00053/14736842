Reduced serotonin type 1A receptor binding in panic disorder. Recent animal models suggest that disturbances in serotonin type-1A receptor (5-HT(1A)R) function may contribute to chronic anxiety, although it is not clear at all whether such models constitute relevant models for panic disorder (PD) in humans. The selective 5-HT(1A)R radioligand [18F]trans-4-fluoro-N-2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (FCWAY) permits in vivo assessment of central 5-HT(1A)R binding using positron emission tomography (PET). We studied 16 unmedicated symptomatic outpatients with PD and 15 matched healthy controls. Seven patients had an additional diagnosis of a current major depressive episode, however PD was the primary diagnosis. A 120 min PET study of 5-HT(1A)R binding was acquired using a GE Advance scanner in three-dimensional mode. Using quantitative PET image analysis, regional values were obtained for [18F]-FCWAY volume of distribution (DV), corrected for plasma protein binding, and K1, the delivery rate of [18F]-FCWAY from plasma to tissue. MRI scanning was performed using a GE Signa Scanner (3.0 Tesla) to provide an anatomical framework for image analysis and partial volume correction of PET data. PD patients showed lower DV in the anterior cingulate (t = 4.3 p < 0.001), posterior cingulate (t = 4.1
