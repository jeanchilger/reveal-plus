Assessment of the metabolic flow phenotype of primary colorectal cancer: correlations with microvessel density are influenced by the histological scoring method. To investigate how the histological scoring of microvessel density affects correlations between integrated (18)F-FDG-PET/perfusion CT parameters and CD105 microvessel density.A total of 53 patients were enrolled from 2007 to 2010. Integrated (18)F-FDG-PET/perfusion CT was successful in 45 patients, 35 of whom underwent surgery without intervening treatment. Tumour SUV(max), SUV(mean) and regional blood flow (BF) were derived. Immunohistochemical staining for CD105 expression and analysis were performed for two hot spots, four hot spots and the Chalkley method. Correlations between metabolic flow parameters and CD105 expression were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation.Mean (SD) for tumour size was 38.5 (20.5) mm, for SUV(max), SUV(mean) and BF it was 19.1 (4.5), 11.6 (2.5) and 85.4 (40.3) mL/min/100 g tissue, and for CD105 microvessel density it was 71.4 (23.6), 66.8 (22.9) and 6.18 (2.07) for two hot spots, four hot spots and the Chalkley method, respectively. Positive correlation between BF and CD105 expression was modest but higher for Chalkley than for four hot spots analysis (r = 0.38, P = 0.03 r = 0.33, P = 0.05, respectively). There were no significant correlations between metabolic parameters (SUV(max) or SUV(mean)) and CD105 expression (r = 0.08-0.22, P = 0.21-0.63).The histological analysis method affects correlations between tumour CD105 expression and BF but not SUV(max) or SUV(mean).• FDG-PET/perfusion CT offers new surrogate biomarkers of angiogenesis. • Microvessel density scoring influences histopathological correlations with CT blood flow. • Highest correlations were found with the Chalkley analysis method. • Correlations between SUV and CD105 are not affected by the scoring method.
