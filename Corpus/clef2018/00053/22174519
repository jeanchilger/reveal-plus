Transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia: A case with whole-body 2-[F18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography. The case reported here was that of an old woman characterized by pancytopenia, chromosome clonal abnormality, fluctuation of the percent of blast cells at 20%, and negative evidence of malignancy in whole-body 2-[F18] fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography (F18-FDG PET). After about 10 months, the blast cells accounted for about 25%, the morphology of which was similar to that of previous ones, and F18-FDG PET demonstrated diffusing increased uptake in the right upper leg and lymph nodes and patchy high uptake of bone marrow. 2-[F18]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose can reflect extramedullary infiltration and bone marrow cellularity of the whole body, compared with invasive, regional biopsies and aspirations. The value of 2-[F18]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose or 3'-deoxy-3'-[F18]-fluorothymidine positron emission tomography as an indicator in predicting the transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia needs to be explored in the future.
