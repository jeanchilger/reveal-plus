Characteristics of advantages of positron emission tomography over computed tomography for N-staging in lung cancer patients. We analyzed the characteristics of advantages of positron emission tomography (PET) over computed tomography (CT) for N-staging in lung cancer patients.Preoperative PET and CT scans were performed for 2057 lymph node stations in 205 patients with peripheral-type lung cancer. The advantages of PET over CT for N-staging were analyzed among lymph node locations and histological subtypes.The pathological N-stages were N0 in 143 patients, N1 in 31, N2 in 24 and N3 in 7. PET was able to diagnose N0, N2 and N3 diseases more accurately than CT (P=0.03, 0.01 and 0.02, respectively), but there was no significant difference between the two modalities for N1 disease. In the upper mediastinal lymph node stations, both false-negative and false-positive were significantly less frequent with PET than with CT (P=0.001). In the lower mediastinal and supra clavicle lymph nodes, PET showed a lower frequency of false-negative than CT (P=0.04 and 0.003, respectively), but there was no significant difference in the frequency of false-positive between the two modalities. Among histological types, PET could stage adenocarcinoma with less frequent false-negative and squamous cell carcinoma with less frequent false-positive than CT (P=0.02 and 0.005, respectively).For N-staging, PET was superior to CT for the following: (1) more accurate for N0, N2 and N3 diseases but not for N1 (2) lower frequency of false-positive in the upper mediastinal nodes
