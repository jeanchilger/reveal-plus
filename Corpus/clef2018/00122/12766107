Prevalence and major risk factors of reduced flow volume in lower extremities with normal ankle-brachial index in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. To clarify the prevalence and major risk factors of reduced flow volume in lower extremities with normal ankle-brachial index (ABI) in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.We recruited 208 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients and 33 age-matched nondiabetic subjects (control group) admitted to our hospital. Thirty-two of the patients had low ABI (<0.90) and intermittent claudication (peripheral arterial disease [PAD] group), and 176 patients had normal ABI (>0.9) (non-PAD group). We evaluated flow volume and resistive index, as an index of arterial resistance to blood flow, at the popliteal artery using gated two-dimensional cine-mode phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging.Simple linear regression analysis showed a negative correlation between resistive index and total flow volume in the non-PAD group (r = -0.714, P < 0.001). We defined the means +/- 2 SD of these parameters in the control group as the normal range abnormal resistive index was >1.017, and abnormal flow volume was <50.8 ml/min. The non-PAD group was divided according to the levels of these parameters: 80 patients had both normal resistive index and normal flow volume (normal group)The prevalence of patients without PAD with reduced flow volume in the lower extremities was 16% (n = 33) and comparable with that of patients with PAD with intermittent claudication (n = 32), suggesting that increase in arterial resistance to blood flow may be one of the major causes of lower extremity arterial disease in Japan.
