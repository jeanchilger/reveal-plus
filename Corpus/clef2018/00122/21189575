Effects of Angelica sinensis injection on the neuronal metabolites and blood flow speed within reperfusion following the ischemic cerebral injury in rats. To investigate the effects of Angelica sinensis injection on the neuronal metabolites and blood flow speed within reperfusion in the ischemic cerebral injury of rats.Sixty-nine male Sprague Dawley rats with an average body weight of 150 to 170 g were used, and were randomly divided into three groups: sham operation group (n = 4), ischemia injury group (n = 30) underwent an operation of ischemic brain injury, Angelica-treated group (n = 35) underwent the same operation and received the treatment of Angelica sinensis injection (5 g/kg bw, i. p). The right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) of both ischemia injury group and Angelica-treated group rats was induced by 5/0 nylon suture for 2 hours. The reperfusion was conducted for three to four hours and five to six hours respectively following MCAO. T2 weighted-imaging (T2WI) and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) were performed, to study the changes in imaging and neuronal metabolites N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr/ PCr) and choline (Cho) following cerebral ischemia. The changes in blood flow speed were measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. The surface vascular density in right hemisphere were calculated.The hyperintense signals and volume in the right cerebrum in Angelica-treated group decreased compared with those of the ischemia injury group, the T2 values were decreased, and the level of NAA increased, the ratio of Cr/NAA and Cho/NAA decreased. The blood flow speed in Angelica-treated group was improved. The length of brain surface vessels in group C increased.The Angelica sinensis injection enhanced the blood circulation in the ischemic brain, improved the neuronal metabolisms.
