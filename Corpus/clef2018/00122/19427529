Methodological study investigating long term laser Doppler measured cerebral blood flow changes in a permanently occluded rat stroke model. Cerebral blood flow is impaired during middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat model of stroke. However, the long term effects on cerebral blood flow following occlusion have received little attention. We examined cerebral blood flow in both sides at multiple time points following middle cerebral artery occlusion of the rat. The bilateral cerebral blood flow in young male Sprague Dawley rats was measured at the time of occlusion, as well as 4, 10 and 16 weeks after occlusion. Under the present experimental conditions, the difference between the left and right side's cerebral blood flow was observed to appear to switch in direction in a visual oscillatory fashion over time in the sham-treated group, whereas the occluded animals consistently showed left side dominance. One group of rats was intraparenchymally transplanted with a human neural stem cell line (CTX0E03 cells) known to have benefit in stroke models. Cerebral blood flow in the lesioned side of the cell-treated group was observed to be improved compared to the untreated rats and to demonstrate a similar oscillatory nature as that observed in sham-treated animals. These findings suggest that multiple bilateral monitoring of cerebral blood flow over time can show effects of stem cell transplantation efficiently as well as functional tests in an animal stroke model.
