Super-early iodine-123-iodoamphetamine SPECT imaging of human primary motor cortex. This study was designed to visualize the motor function area related to finger movements in normal human brain using super-early (first 640 sec of acquisition) [123l]iodoamphetamine ([123I]IMP) SPECT.Seven healthy male volunteers performed paired, isolated baseline and task sessions. The task was a right thumb-to-fingers opposition task, which was loaded for the initial 11 min of the session. A high-performance, four-head SPECT camera was used. At each session, administration of 222 MBq [123I]IMP was followed by 16 serial 160-sec dynamic SPECT acquisitions. To obtain matched brain anatomical images, MRI was also performed using the same slice formation as in the SPECT study. After image reconstruction, ROIs were set on bilateral sensorimotor hand areas (SMHA), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes and the cerebellar hemispheres. The percent increase of ROI activity (%INC) in the task session compared with that in the baseline session was calculated in each ROI after normalization to the global brain radioactivity.There was significant activation of the left SMHA by the task, the amplitude of which was maximal in the initial phase of dynamic images (the super-early phase). This area was located in the left peri-central area identified on the analogous slice in the MR image. The left SMHA showed gradual and statistically significant decrease of %INC during the three phases.Super-early [123I]IMP may be used to identify the primary motor cortex and to evaluate its function in some pathological conditions.
