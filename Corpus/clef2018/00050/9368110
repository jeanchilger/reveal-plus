Three-dimensional PET emission scan registration and transmission scan synthesis. The duration of a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging scan can be reduced if the transmission scan of one patient which is used for emission correction can be synthesized by using the reference transmission scan of another patient. In this paper, we propose a new intersubjects PET emission scan registration method and PET transmission synthesis method by using the boundary information of the body or brain scan of the PET emission scans. The PET emission scans have poor image quality and different intensity statistics so that we preprocess the emission scans to have similar histogram and then apply the point distribution model (PDM) [15] to extract the contours of the emission scan. The extracted boundary contour of every slice is used to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3-D) surface of the reference set and the target set. Our registration is 3-D surface-based which uses the normal flow method [17] to find the correspondence vector field between two 3-D reconstructed surfaces. Since it is difficult to analyze internal organ using the PET emission scan imaging without correction, we assume that the deformation of internal organ is homogeneous. With the corresponding vector field between the two emission scans and the transmission scan of the reference set, we can synthesize the transmission scan of the target set.
