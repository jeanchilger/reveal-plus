Evaluation of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the management of soft-tissue sarcomas. We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the ability of whole-body F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) to identify local recurrence and pulmonary metastases in patients with soft-tissue tumours after treatment. We compared the results of FDG PET with those of MRI for the detection of local recurrence, and with CT of the chest for pulmonary metastases. We assessed 62 patients of mean age 51 years, who had 15 types of soft-tissue sarcoma, after a mean follow-up of 3 years 2 months. For the detection of local disease, 71 comparisons showed that the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET were 73.7% and 94.3%, respectively there were 14 true-positive and five false-negative results. MRI had a sensitivity and specificity of 88.2% and 96.0% respectively. For the identification of lung metastases, 70 comparisons showed that the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET were 86.7% and 100%, with 13 true-positive results and two false-negative results. CT of the chest had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 96.4%. Thirteen other sites of metastases were identified by FDG PET. FDG PET can identify both local and distant recurrence of tumour as a one-step procedure and will detect other metastases. It seems that all three methods of imaging are needed to define accurately the extent of disease, both at initial staging and during follow-up.
