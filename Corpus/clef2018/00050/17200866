Statistical parametric mapping and statistical probabilistic anatomical mapping analyses of basal/acetazolamide Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT for efficacy assessment of endovascular stent placement for middle cerebral artery stenosis. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and statistical probabilistic anatomical mapping (SPAM) were applied to basal/acetazolamide Tc-99m ECD brain perfusion SPECT images in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis to assess the efficacy of endovascular stenting of the MCA.Enrolled in the study were 11 patients (8 men and 3 women, mean age 54.2 +/- 6.2 years) who had undergone endovascular stent placement for MCA stenosis. Using SPM and SPAM analyses, we compared the number of significant voxels and cerebral counts in basal and acetazolamide SPECT images before and after stenting, and assessed the perfusion changes and cerebral vascular reserve index (CVRI).The numbers of hypoperfusion voxels in SPECT images were decreased from 10,083 +/- 8,326 to 4,531 +/- 5,091 in basal images (P = 0.0317) and from 13,398 +/- 14,222 to 7,699 +/- 10,199 in acetazolamide images (P = 0.0142) after MCA stenting. On SPAM analysis, the increases in cerebral counts were significant in acetazolamide images (90.9 +/- 2.2 to 93.5 +/- 2.3, P = 0.0098) but not in basal images (91 +/- 2.7 to 92 +/- 2.6, P = 0.1602). The CVRI also showed a statistically significant increase from before stenting (median 0.32 95% CI -2.19-2.37) to after stenting (median 1.59This study revealed the usefulness of voxel-based analysis of basal/acetazolamide brain perfusion SPECT after MCA stent placement. This study showed that SPM and SPAM analyses of basal/acetazolamide Tc-99m brain SPECT could be used to evaluate the short-term hemodynamic efficacy of successful MCA stent placement.
