Consensus development conference on the medical treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: treatment of the early stages. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but more than 80% of recurrences occur within 2 years from radical surgery. The pattern of recurrence may differ by histology with more local recurrences seen for patients with squamous cell carcinoma and more distant metastases seen in patients with adenocarcinoma. A number of studies demonstrate that dissemination of cancer cells at levels much below those detected by any current available imaging techniques, including PET scanning also, affect prognosis of patients with clinical early-stage NSCLC. The current clinical evidence does not recommend adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in completely resected stage I-II-IIIA for N1. There are few randomised trials available for analysis of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy involving patients with resectable stage III disease overall these trials suggest that induction chemotherapy (with or without radiation) improves survival, particularly in those patients who undergo significant downstaging. Heterogeneous study populations limit the ability to define the optimal patient population who would most benefit from this approach. There is no conclusive evidence that neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in early NSCLC is associated with an increased post surgical morbility and mortality. Additional trials are needed. More recently neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been tested in resectable stage I-II NSCLC and proved to be feasible and better tolerated than adjuvant chemotherapy. Several randomised trials are currently ongoing. In the next future the role of targeted biological therapies as agents acting on minimal residual disease should be explored.
