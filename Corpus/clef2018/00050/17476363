Neuroimaging and genetics of borderline personality disorder: a review. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that carries a severe risk factor for adolescent and young adult suicide. Relatively little research has examined its biological etiology. Differences in the volume and activity in brain structures related to emotion and impulsivity have been observed between individuals who have BPD and those who do not. The present study seeks to assess current research on the neuroanatomical differences observed between individuals with and without BPD and the genes that may play a role in the development of this disorder.
