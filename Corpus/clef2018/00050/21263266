Evaluation of treatment response after nonoperative therapy for early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma. Nonsurgical management of early primary lung cancer has grown tremendously in recent years, and today, available options extend far beyond that of conventional radiation therapy (CRT) to include minimally invasive image-guided delivery of thermal energies, specifically radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation, and more conformal stereotactic body radiation therapy. Because the tumor is never resected with these nonoperative interventions, histopathological evaluation of tumor margins for the presence of residual tumor is impossible, and as such, tumor response after each of these therapies is largely based on imaging. To date, computerized tomography and computerized tomography-positron emission tomography remain the most readily available modalities for assessment of therapeutic efficacy, and to this end as detailed within this article, strict imaging survey and familiarity with the expected imaging characteristics of the treated tumor will aid in recognition of unexpected findings, specifically those of incomplete therapy and/or tumor recurrence.
