Alzheimer's disease: anterior-posterior and lateral hemispheric alterations in cortical glucose utilization. We performed dynamic positron emission tomographic studies with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose in 17 subjects with presumed Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 7 healthy aged subjects. Glucose metabolism was depressed by 27% in temporal-parietal cortex of the AD group, as compared to healthy aged controls. This focal impairment in temporal-parietal glucose use was found in all AD subjects. In addition, the AD group showed a striking lateral asymmetry of cortical metabolism not favoring either hemisphere, which has not been previously reported. Relationships between these focal changes and behavioral features of the illness were demonstrated. These results have important implications for the diagnosis and perhaps the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.
