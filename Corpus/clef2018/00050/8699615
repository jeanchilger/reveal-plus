Exposure to the technologists from radioactive patients during nuclear medicine studies. In order to evaluate the exposure to the nuclear medicine technologists from patients who had been administrated with radiopharmaceuticals, we measured the exposure in 5 common diagnostic procedures (bone, lung, tumor scan, and brain, myocardial SPECT, n = 8 to 52) using a silicon semiconductor pocket dosimeter. We also measured the spatial dose rates at 5 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm from skin surface of the patients (n = 10 to 21) using an ionization chamber, both 5 min after injection and right before the studies with the same procedures above. We further measured the spatial dose rate distributions around the patients in the 4 procedures (bone, renal, blood pool scan, and brain SPECT, n = 2 to 3). In results, the exposure to the technologists in each procedure was small (0.5, 0.5, 0.7, 1.6, and 0.3 muSv in each bone, lung, tumor scan, and brain, myocardial SPECT, respectively), compared with the dose limits of the medical workers. However, the dose-response relationships in cancer and hereditary effects, referred to as the stochastic effects, have been assumed linear and no threshold models therefore, the exposure should be minimized. For this purpose, the measurements of spatial dose rates and spatial dose rate distributions were thought to be useful. The differences of these results among procedures were caused by the differences of dose distributions and physical and biological half lives of the radiopharmaceuticals. The results of the measurements in 7 consecutive weeks suggested that the direct measurement of the exposure using a high sensitive digital pocket dosimeter might result a reduced exposure to the technologists.
