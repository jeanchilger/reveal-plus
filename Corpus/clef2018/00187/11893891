Cervical hematomyelia: a rare entity in a neonate with cesarean section and surgical recovery. Spinal cord injury with or without trauma has been reported in the perinatal period. The prognosis depends primarily on diagnosis of the level, extent and nature of the lesion, established by correlations between clinical, imaging and electrophysiological data. A 25-day-old boy with normal birth weight delivered at term by cesarean section was transferred to Inönü University Turgut Ozal Medical Center because of respiratory distress and brachial diplegia. A suspicious medullary lesion on cervical computerized tomography was confirmed as an intramedullary lesion extending from C3 to D1 on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Emergent surgery consisting of exposure of the lesion site and interlaminar direct puncture of the lesion under fluoroscopy revealed that the pathology was an intramedullary hematoma. The partial evacuation of the lesion with direct puncture, the patient's neurological improvement and close follow-up of the patient with ultrasonography, electrophysiology and MRI are discussed in the light of recent literature.
