Medullary compression by Burkitt lymphoma. Analysis of 7 cases. Burkitt's lymphoma is one of the possible cause of spinal cord compression. We defined the surgical approach in this rare localization of Burkitt's lymphoma.We report 7 cases of spinal cord compression secondary to Burkitt's lymphoma treated at the Yopougon University Hospital from October 1990 to October 1994.Mean age of the patients was 15.4 years, range 8 to 28 years. Five of the 7 patients were children. Surgery was both a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency in this rare but serious localization of Burkitt's disease, which remains highly chemosensitive.Surgical management is warranted if Burkitt's lymphoma is revealed by spinal cord compression or if there is a primary spinal epidural localization.
