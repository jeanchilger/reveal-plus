Vascular insufficiency of the cervical cord due to hyperextension of the spine. A patient with acute transverse myelopathy after minor trauma due to hyperextension of the neck is reported. The pattern of neurologic deficit favors the diagnosis of acute central cervical spinal cord syndrome. The proposed causative mechanism is temporary vascular insufficiency of the spinal cord. The architecture of vascular supply of the spinal cord and specific cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in this patient are compatible with the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of traumatic vascular spinal cord lesions is discussed.
