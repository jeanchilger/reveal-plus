Traumatic bilateral vertebral artery dissection at the dural entry point site in a 10-year-old boy. We present a 10-year-old boy who was admitted with headache and neurological symptoms after a trauma in the school yard. Cerebral MRI revealed an extensive ischaemia in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, left middle cerebellar peduncle, and right vermis. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated bilateral vertebral artery dissections at the dural entry point site. This case emphasises the management of patients with traumatic vertebral artery dissection.
