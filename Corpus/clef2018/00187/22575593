Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of primary intraspinal peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour. The purpose of our study was to describe the salient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in primary intraspinal peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET).A retrospective review of the clinical and MRI images of 7 pathologically proven cases of intraspinal peripheral PNETs was performed. The various parameters, such as vertebral level of involvement tumour location, size, focality, and marginAll 7 patients had lesions in the thoracolumbar region. Three patients had extradural lesions, 4 had intradural extramedullary lesions, and none had intramedullary lesions. Six lesions were well circumscribed. Only 1 patient had multifocal involvement. All lesions were of hypointense or isointense signal on T1-weighted imaging, whereas all but one were hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. Lesions enhanced heterogeneously except 1 intradural extramedullary lesion, which enhanced homogeneously. A paraspinal mass was noticed in 2 patients. Vertebral collapse was present in 1 patients.Intraspinal peripheral PNETs are rare spinal tumours. Although imaging characteristics are not specific, a focal circumscribed lesion in a young individual at the intramedullary, extramedullary intradural, or extradural spinal location that shows hypointense and hyperintense signal on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively, requires PNET to be considered in the differentials.
