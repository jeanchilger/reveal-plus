Spinal cord involvement in Burkitt-type lymphoma: report of a case. Case report of Burkitt's type lymphoma with involvement of the spinal cord in a three years-old child. An epidural tumoral mass (T11-L1) was removed surgically (Fig. 2), and clinical conditions improved for a short period of time (1 and 1/2 months) after which symptoms reappeared. At this occasion a computerized tomography showed a tumoral mass occupying the spinal canal with high density at the L2 level. The patient died 6 months after the beginning of the disease. General considerations are made on Burkitt's lymphoma.
