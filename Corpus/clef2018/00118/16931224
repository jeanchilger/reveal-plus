Transient encephalopathy complicating poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in an adult with diagnostic findings consistent with cerebral vasculitis. We report the case of a young woman who had transient encephalopathy with nausea, cognitive impairment, 2 generalized seizures accompanied by visual impairment, and stenotic alterations of cerebral vessels lasting for weeks until complete resolution. These findings were associated with an elevated antideoxyribonuclease B level and biopsy-proven poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. At the time of the encephalopathy, the patient had no electrolyte level disturbances, an only mildly elevated urea level, and moderate arterial hypertension and was on methylprednisolone therapy. For a couple of days, cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple disseminated asymmetric hyperintensities on T(2)-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, suggesting vasogenic edema. However, Doppler ultrasound examinations showed stenoses of extracerebral and multiple intracerebral arteries that persisted for several weeks, lasting considerably longer than the cerebral edema. This finding does not fit the context of hypertensive or steroid-induced encephalopathy, but is consistent with diagnosis of an accompanying vasculitis. Treatment with methylprednisolone for several weeks was associated with resolution of arterial stenoses and neurological symptoms, complete reversibility of Doppler sonographic findings, and significant improvement in renal function.
