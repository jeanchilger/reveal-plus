Characteristics of extracoronary vascular disease in heart transplant recipient. Heart transplant candidates carry many of risk factors for vascular disease, and in addition, recipients continue to accumulate them following heart transplantation (HTx). However, very limited information is available on this entity. This study was designed to address characteristics of extracoronary vascular disease in heart transplant recipients.This is a nonconcurrent cohort study of 402 patients who received HTx at the University of Washington between 1985 and 2004. Pretransplant arterial evaluation included carotid, lower extremity, and renal artery duplex studies. CT angiogram was obtained when indicated. Patients with severe arterial disease were excluded from the transplant list. Posttransplant vascular evaluation was done with the patient's history and physical examination.Median follow-up was 5.5 years. Seventy vascular diseases were detected in 49 patients (12% of study population). Patients with pretransplant vascular disease, compared to those without, were older at the HTx, carried the diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy more commonly, and had more comorbidities including history of smoking, alcohol drinking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prior heart operations. The prevalence of vascular disease was 6% prior to HTx and it cumulatively increased up to 17% at 17 years after HTx. Nineteen percent of these diseases were the result of arterial traumas mostly caused by medical interventions. Fourteen patients developed abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with two deaths.It is important for care providers to be aware of the high probability of vascular disease, to be familiar with vascular disease, and to provide appropriate prophylactic and therapeutic measures when evaluating this patient population.
