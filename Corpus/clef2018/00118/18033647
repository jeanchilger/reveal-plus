Common carotid artery dissection in the course of acute aortic dissection De Bakey type I. Extracranial artery dissection is a rare finding. It may be the result of acute aortic dissection. We present the case of a 50-year-old patient admitted to Department of Neurology CSK MSWiA with signs of transient ischaemic attack. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no ischaemic changes within the central nervous system. The ultrasonography revealed dissection of the right common carotid artery, brachiocephalic trunk and aorta. Acute aortic dissection De Bakey type I was confirmed on CT scans of the chest and abdomen. Emergency cardiosurgery was performed because of acute aortic valve insufficiency, threatening infarction in the territory of the right coronary artery and heart tamponade. During the surgery the false aortic lumen was closed and the ascending graft was implanted. Short- and long-term outcome was good. Neither neurological symptoms nor cardiovascular insufficiency was observed within 9 months of follow-up.
