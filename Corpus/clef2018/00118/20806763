Acute tibial compartment syndrome following spine surgery. This article presents a case of a patient with popliteal artery occlusion following anterior and posterior instrumented fusion of the lumbar spine. No previous study has reported acute anterior tibial compartment syndrome due to popliteal artery occlusion and restricted venous return following spine surgery. A 53-year old female, with a twice failed fusion of L5-S1, underwent L3-S1 anterior interbody and posterior L3-S1 instrumented fusion. Due to postoperative continuous analgesia, the patient was sleepy and confused on postoperative day 1. On the postoperative day 2, the right calf and anterolateral tibia manifested clinical signs of compartment syndrome and both thighs exhibited pressure ecchymoses from the antiembolism stockings. Fasciotomies of the right tibial compartments were undertaken and necrosis of the anterior compartment muscles was found. Intraoperative arteriogram revealed occlusion of the right popliteal artery and thrombectomy was performed. Lupus anticoagulant was found to be responsible for patient's coagulopathy. During postoperative year 1, the patient still had weakness and recurrent edema of the right foot. Unrecognized limb ischemia and possibly restricted venous return were the causes of the compartment syndrome. Surgeons should be aware of this devastating complication of spine surgery.
