Detection of postoperative pseudoaneurysms following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in Behçet's disease by MRA. We report the development of two anastomotic pseudoaneurysms in a patient with Behçet's disease eighteen months after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Major asymptomatic vascular complications should be suspected in patients with Behçet's disease with a history of vascular surgery and treated expediently due to the risk of rupture. Magnetic resonance angiography, contrast-enhanced computed tomography or ultrasound scanning should be performed at least every 6 months after vascular surgery.
