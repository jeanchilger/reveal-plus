Subclavian steal syndrome secondary to Takayasu arteritis. We present a case of 'subclavian steal syndrome' secondary to Takayasu arteritis, in a 32-year-old, Japanese woman, whose clinical manifestations result from severe ocular and brain ischemia, refractory to high dose systemic corticosteroids. Surgical management using two bypass-grafts was carried out. The first one, a GoreTex, 8 mm in diameter, thin wall, stretch type with ring-bypass graft, from the left external iliac artery to the ipsilateral axillary artery. The second one, an autologous reverse saphenous vein graft from the left subclavian artery to the ipsilateral common carotid artery. The result was a remarkable improvement of the patient's general condition and symptoms. Patency of the extra-anatomic conduits was established by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and transcranial Doppler evaluation, as well as flow velocity assessment revealed an objective improvement of the blood supply to the ischemic areas. The present surgical approach was justified since the inflammatory process extended to the aortic arch. The development of new and efficient operatory techniques, and continuous improvement of the graft-materials provide better expectations for the long-term outcome of refractory syndromes.
