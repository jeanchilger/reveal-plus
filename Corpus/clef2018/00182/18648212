Prenatal diagnosis and subsequent treatment of an intermediate-risk paraspinal neuroblastoma: case report and review of the literature. Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, and the most common malignancy diagnosed during infancy. In comparison, neonatal neuroblastoma is relatively rare. Improvements in prenatal imaging and widespread use of fetal ultrasonography have led to an increased rate of prenatal diagnoses.Case report and literature review.We report a case of an intermediate-risk neuroblastoma, diagnosed at 36 weeks' gestation by ultrasound and subsequently visualized by fetal MRI, that resulted in spinal cord compression and decreased fetal movement. A multidisciplinary team approach resulted in rapid delivery, evaluation, biopsy, staging, and treatment implementation in a successful effort to preserve lower extremity function.Prenatal diagnosis of neuroblastoma, management and outcomes are reviewed. Prompt diagnosis can strongly influence perinatal management and improve prognosis.
