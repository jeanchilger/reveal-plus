Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a child presenting with acute paraplegia: a case report. Spinal cord compression is a rare presentation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Extradural location at onset is a rare but devastating event in pediatric oncology. The authors describe a girl with acute spinal cord compression due to epidural non-Hodgkin lymphoma, emphasizing the encouraging perspective for a complete recovery in children with this condition. A 5-year-old girl presented with pain followed by progressive hyposthenia and paraplegia after a trauma. CT scan and MRI showed homogeneous tissue extending from T2 to L4, occupying the entire vertebral canal and extending to the para- and peri-vertebral soft parts. Emergency surgical debulking was carried out through T6-L1 laminectomy. The patient began chemotherapy (LMB 89 Protocol) and the tumor quickly disappeared. The patient is maintaining a complete remission 42 months after diagnosis. Significant results may be obtained with the chemotherapy treatment of epidural non-Hodgkin lymphoma when the disease is promptly diagnosed. Considering the effectiveness of chemotherapy, the authors believe that a neuro-surgical approach should be employed only when rapid worsening of symptoms is observed or for diagnostic purpose.
