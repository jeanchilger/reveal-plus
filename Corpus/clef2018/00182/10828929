Neonatal infectious spondylitis of the cervical spine presenting with quadriplegia: a case report. A case report.-To highlight the evaluation and treatment of neonatal infectious spondylitis of the cervical spine.Most authors advise intravenous antibiotics as first-choice treatment. The place of aspiration or operative drainage is debated, as is the position and duration of immobilization.A 3-week-old neonate was presented with intermittent quadriplegia.Additional investigation demonstrated an osteolytic process in the body of C3 with a large epidural abscess compressing the spinal cord. Because an infectious spondylitis of C3 was suspected, aspiration of the abscess was performed, and antibiotic therapy was started. The patient improved to neurologically normal within 3 weeks and remains asymptomatic throughout a follow-up period of 7 years.Neonatal infectious spondylitis should be diagnosed early and treated promptly otherwise, it may have devastating consequences.
