Kyphotic deformation in fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Kyphosis is the typical deformity of untreated spine fractures. In the majority of all injuries, destruction of the anterior part of the spine occurs. Biomechanical aspects require reconstruction of the anterior column. In 112 patients with a traumatic fracture of the thoracolumbar spine, a loss of correction in the sagittal plane exceeded the intraoperative correction. The cause of deterioration was in the main part the destruction of the intervertebral disk. The results of different surgical techniques are reviewed and discussed based on the literature. The dorsal instrumentation with or without autogenous bone grafting is not sufficient for spinal stabilization and kyphosis is the result. The golden standard for prevention of kyphosis is the combined approach with anterior cortical bone graft and posterior transpedicular screwing. In the case of anterior cage implantation, the risk of graft failure can be avoided. With anterior minimally invasive approaches, traumatization can be reduced by using the same biomechanical principles. In the case of a type A fracture with intact posterior elements, use of an anterior primary stable implant with bone graft represents an alternative method.
