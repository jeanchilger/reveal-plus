Can an out-of-hospital cervical spine clearance protocol identify all patients with injuries? An argument for selective immobilization. We sought to determine the sensitivity of the Fresno/Kings/Madera emergency medical services (EMS) selective spine immobilization protocol in identifying patients with potential cervical injuries. We also sought to determine whether the protocol was safe in the out-of-hospital setting.We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients discharged from 5 trauma-receiving hospitals in Fresno County with the diagnosis of cervical spine injury between July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1996. All of these patients transported to the hospital by EMS personnel were selected for the study group. Medical records of those patients not immobilized were further investigated to identify protocol violations or deficiencies.There were 861 patients with significant cervical injuries during this time span. EMS personnel brought 504 patients to the hospital, of which 495 arrived in cervical spine immobilization. Of the remaining 9 patients, 2 refused immobilization, and 2 could not be immobilized 3 injuries were missed by the protocol criteria, and 2 injuries were missed because of protocol violations. Of these last 5 patients, 1 patient had an adverse outcome, 2 injuries were considered unstable, 4 patients were older than 67 years, and one patient was 9 months old.The Fresno/Kings/Madera EMS selective spine immobilization protocol is 99% (95% CI, 97.7% to 99.7%) sensitive in identifying patients with cervical injuries for immobilization. Those patients not identified were at extremes of age. These results suggest that selective immobilization may be safely applied in the out-of-hospital setting but should be used with caution at extremes of age.
