Chemotherapy of chronic infections with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa in lower airways of patients with cystic fibrosis. The bacteriological effect of chemotherapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ps.ae.) in lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis is reviewed. During a 5-year period 49 children and adults were treated with 190 courses of different antibiotics. The mucoid strains of Ps.ae. disappeared in 72.0% of the courses in which a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin was employed. Tobramycin given alone had only bacteriological effect in 26.6% of the courses. Colimycin alone or in combination with carbenicillin had no effect. In 18 patients who received subsequent courses of tobramycin and combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin a significant difference in favour of the combination therapy was found, also in cases with many precipitins against Ps.ae. in serum. In 74.5% of the initially successful courses the patients were recolonized with Ps.ae. within 1 month. No nephrotoxic or ototoxic side effects were demonstrated in spite of the high doses of tobramycin (10 mg/kg/24 h) emmployed and the repeated courses.
