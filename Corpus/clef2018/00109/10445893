Aplastic anemia after Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection: a report of two cases. Two very unusual cases of aplastic anemia complicating mycoplasma infection are described. Each patient had preexisting hematologic abnormalities at the time of the infection: reactive hemophagocytic syndrome in one, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with cold autoantibodies in the other. This adds another entity to the protean manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.
