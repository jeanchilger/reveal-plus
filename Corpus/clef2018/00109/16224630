A cross-sectional study of isolates from sputum samples from bacterial pneumonia patients in Trinidad. We determined the frequency of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative enteric bacteria (GNEB) in pneumonia patients, determined the antibiograms of these pathogens, and investigated the relationship between pneumonia and selected risk factors. Sputum and demographic data were collected from 124 pneumonia patients. Sputum was cultured for S. aureus, GNEB, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. The disc diffusion method was used to determine resistance to eight antimicrobial agents. Among the 124 sputum samples, eight (6.5%) were positive for S. aureus, 15 (12.1%) for GNEB, two (1.6%) for S. pneumoniae and one (0.8%) for H. influenzae. Hospitals, gender, ethnicity, co-morbidities and symptoms did not significantly (p > 0.05 chi2) affect the prevalence of these bacteria. GNEB infection was most prevalent (47%) in patients over 70 years old. Gentamicin and levofloxacin were the most effective against these bacteria.
