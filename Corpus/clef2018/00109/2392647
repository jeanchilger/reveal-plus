Radioopacity of the right paracardiac lung field due to pectus excavatum (funnel chest). Increased density of the right paracardiac lung field is frequently visible in patients with pectus excavatum. This sign is due to compression of the lungs by the bent costal cartilages of the pectus and should not be interpreted as evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.
