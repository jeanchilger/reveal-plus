Endogenous Klebsiella endophthalmitis associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia. To investigate the management, bacterial strains, antibiotic sensitivities, and visual outcomes in patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia and endogenous Klebsiella endophthalmitis.Data were collected for treatments, antibiotic sensitivity patterns, and final visual outcomes.The study included 10 eyes of 9 patients with a median age of 42 years (range, 0-86 years). Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbid risk factor (n = 5, 56%). Nine eyes (90%) were treated with intravitreal antibiotics, and one with pars plana vitrectomy and intravitreal antibiotics. One eye achieved a favorable visual acuity of 20/20 however, 6 eyes developed vision of no light perception, including 2 of evisceration. Two nosocomial K. pneumoniae isolates were extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing strains, which demonstrated the resistance to amikacin and ceftazidime.Ophthalmologists and physicians should be aware of Klebsiella pneumonia as a possible cause of endogenous endophthalmitis, and endogenous Klebsiella endophthalmitis usually causes poor visual outcomes.
