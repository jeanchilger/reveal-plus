Pediatric Burkitt's lymphoma: CT findings. To review and analyze all CT scans of the cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) in children diagnosed in our institution.A retrospective analysis of 33 children with BL between the years 2003 and 2005 seen in our institution was undertaken. Twenty-nine male and four female patients from age 3 to 16 years (with a mean age 5.9 years) were reviewed.The gastrointestinal tract was involved in 19 patients (57.5%), kidneys in 9 (27.2%), peritoneum in 8 (24.2%), liver in 4 (12.1%), spleen in 3 (9%), adrenals in 3 (9%), and pancreas in 1 patient (3%). Extra-nodal head and neck involvement was seen in eight patients (24.2%). Bone involvement in four (12.1%), lung in three (9%), heart in two (6%), skin in two (6%), and testis in one (3%) of these patients. Abdominal lymph nodes were enlarged in 21 children (63.6%), while cervical lymph nodes were enlarged in 8 (24.2%).CT proved to be an invaluable tool in the characterization of the disease processes in these children. In addition, it provided us with useful information about the anatomical distribution, patterns of involvement, as well as complications of BL.
