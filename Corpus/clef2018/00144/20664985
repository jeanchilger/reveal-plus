One year survival with poorly differentiated metastatic pancreatic carcinoma following chemoembolization with gemcitabine and cisplatin. While hepatic arterial chemoembolization is efficacious for a number of malignancies, there is scant data regarding treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We report a complete radiographic response at one year from diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. Gemcitabine/cisplatin based chemoembolization may be of potential benefit for patients with liver-dominant metastases from pancreatic carcinoma. Given the typical survival of 6 months or less in this patient group with standard therapies, further research is warranted.
