Radiologic diagnosis following pancreas transplantation. Technical complications are relatively common after pancreatic transplantation, and most require radiological evaluation. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are helpful in the identification of peripancreatic and intra-abdominal fluid collections. Sterile fluid collections can be effectively treated by percutaneous catheter drainage, whereas most intra-abdominal infections require surgical intervention. Angiography is performed primarily for diagnosis of vascular thrombosis. Recent results suggest that magnetic resonance imaging may be a useful non-invasive method for the detection of pancreatic transplant rejection. Further imaging studies are needed to better define the development of progressive fibrotic atrophy in long-term functioning pancreatic transplants.
