Magnetic resonance tomographic studies of pancreatic transplants. In a pilot study, a total of 16 recipients of a combined pancreatic-renal allograft were examined by means of magnetic resonance imaging. Two groups were formed according to the management of the exocrine secretion: In group I patients (n = 8) the pancreatic duct was occluded with an alcoholic prolamine solution, in group II (n = 8) pancreatic juice was diverted either into a Roux-loop of jejunum (IIa, n = 4) or into the urinary bladder (group IIb, n = 4). On the T1-weighted images no difference was found between both groups with respect to signal intensity. In contrast, on T2-weighted images of group IIb, which were in situ for a significantly shorter time, a higher signal intensity was noticed as compared with the other patients. From these findings it is concluded that graft fibrosis may occur even in pancreas transplants with diversion of the exocrine secretion.
