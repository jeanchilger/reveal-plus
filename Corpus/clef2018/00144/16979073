Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging at 3.0 T what is the ultimate gain in signal-to-noise ratio? The purpose of this study was to calculate the gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of four human abdominal tissues at 3.0 Tesla (T) compared with standard 1.5 T and to validate this calculation in vivo.The expected gain in SNR at 3.0 T in the liver, pancreas, spleen, and kidney compared with standard 1.5 T was approximated theoretically for a T2-weighted HASTE (half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo) and a T1-weighted gradient-echo in- and opposed-phase sequence. Fifteen healthy male subjects underwent abdominal MR imaging using a 1.5 T and 3.0 T scanner. Coronal T2-weighted HASTE images and axial T1-weighted gradient-echo in- and opposed-phase images were acquired using the sequence parameters optimized by the vendor.Except for opposed-phased imaging of pancreatic tissue, in vivo adjusted SNR values of all abdominal tissues were significantly higher at 3.0 T for all sequences (P < .05). The highest overall gain in SNR was achieved with the HASTE sequence ranging from 3.8-fold for renal imaging to 7.4-fold for hepatic imaging. The theoretical calculation of SNR gain was in good agreement with the experimentally measured gain in SNR for the HASTE and the in-phase sequence.High-field abdominal MR imaging at 3.0 T offers significantly higher SNR compared with standard 1.5 T MR imaging.
