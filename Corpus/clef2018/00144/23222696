Single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography in the evaluation of neuroendocrine tumours:  a review of the literature. The scintigraphic investigation of neuroendocrine tumours such as carcinoids has depended on standard techniques such as I-metaiodobenzylguanidine and In-pentetreotide imaging. More recently, the use of PET techniques such as Ga-DOTATATE has been advocated. An alternative improved modality is high-quality single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), which has the advantages of better sensitivity and specificity and has shown improved localization in up to 60% of cases. These advantages are especially true for pancreatic and lymph node lesions. Overall, SPECT/CT can result in a change in clinical management in 25% of patients. Although it is possible to combine SPECT and CT performed at different time points, there is better anatomical localization and improved reporter confidence when SPECT and CT are performed simultaneously.
