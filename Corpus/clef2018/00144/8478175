Magnetic resonance imaging after arterial portography with manganese dipyridoxal diphosphate. The authors assess performing hepatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after arterial portography with manganese dipyridoxal diphosphate (MnD-PDP), a hepatobiliary contrast agent, as an invasive but potentially highly sensitive means of focal lesion detection.Eight pigs underwent superior mesenteric artery catheterization and injection of 10 mumol/kg MnDPDP. Magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T (SE-140/10) was performed before, then at 15 and 30 minutes after injection. Seven or more days later, the same MRI protocol was performed after intravenous injection of 10 mumol/kg MnDPDP.Fifteen minutes after intra-arterial injection, enhancement of the liver predominated (86 +/- 13%), followed by the renal cortex (44 +/- 14%), pancreas (26 +/- 9%), and spleen (14 +/- 9%). At 30 minutes, enhancement of renal cortex significantly increased (50 +/- 14%). There was no significant difference in enhancement of the liver, spleen, pancreas, or renal cortex when we compared intra-arterial and intravenous administration.After the injection of 10 mumol/kg MnDPDP into the superior mesenteric artery of pigs there is no significant difference in visceral organ enhancement compared to intravenous administration. The data suggests that the hepatocyte binding sites may be overwhelmed by this dose and/or injection rate of MnDPDP.
