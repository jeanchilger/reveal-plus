MR imaging in the evaluation of blunt pancreatic trauma. Pancreatic injuries caused by blunt trauma are unusual but associated with a high morbidity and a high mortality because of a delay in diagnosis. Clinical and laboratory findings are non-specific. Accurate grading of blunt pancreatic injury with identification of pancreatic duct disruption helps to define practical treatment guidelines. Computed tomography does not allow direct visualization of the pancreatic duct and may result in low accuracy for the detection of ductal injury. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography is the "gold standard" but invasive (3-5% complication rate, mainly pancreatitis) and may not be possible in up to 30% of patients, or requested after surgery. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography may be used as a therapeutic modality (stenting of the main pancreatic duct). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is non invasive and preliminary results are promising. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography detects pseudocysts, has multiplanar capability and complemented with conventional MR imaging allows evaluation of the pancreatic parenchyma.
