Pseudocystic pleural fistula documented by retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The use of recently introduced methods such as computerised axial tomography (CAT), in addition to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), has in recent years led to attainment of new targets in the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. The Authors present a clinical case of massive and recurring left pleural effusion in a patient with a pseudocyst at the level of the cauda pancreatis. They report the clinico-diagnostico-instrumental factors leading to pre-operative diagnosis of pseudocystic-pleural fistula.
