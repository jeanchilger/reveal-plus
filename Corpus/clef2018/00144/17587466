A rarely diagnosed paraneoplastic syndrome: cerebral venous thrombosis. Cerebral venous thromboses are uncommon in cancer, and rarely presents as a paraneoplastic syndrome. A 42-year-old patient presented with headache and a bilateral papillar edema. Cerebral computed tomographic (CT) scan did not find a tumoral process. Biological tests disclosed increased acute phase reactants and liver cytolysis and cholestasis. Cerebral magnetic resonance angiogram showed superior longitudinal venous thrombosis. Thoracoabdominal CT scan was performed and disclosed multiple secondary liver nodules. CA 19-9 serum level was increased to 7648 UI/ml. Liver biopsy revealed a slightly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma compatible with a biliary tract or a pancreatic neoplasia. Chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil was instituted but disease outcome was rapidly unfavourable.
