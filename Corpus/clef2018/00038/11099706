Cobalt-55 positron emission tomography in late-onset epileptic seizures after thrombo-embolic middle cerebral artery infarction. The pathogenesis of late-onset epileptic seizures after thrombo-embolic cerebral infarction is poorly understood. Our previous positron emission tomographic (PET) studies with 15O have demonstrated that post-apoplectic epilepsy is associated with more severe brain ischemia, but we were unable to determine if this was the cause or the consequence of the seizures. Using cobalt-55 (55Co) as PET tracer we can now distinguish recurrent, recent infarction in patients with a previous old infarct in the same vascular territory. In seven out of twelve patients with post-apoplectic seizures an increased uptake of 55Co was observed in the border area and in two of them also within the old infarct core. In the control group, composed of eight seizure-free patients with also an old infarct involving the cortical territory of the middle cerebral artery, no increase in 55Co uptake was observed on PET examination. The present study indicates that in a significant number of patients late-onset epilepsy is the clinical expression of recurrent strokes, occurring in the same vascular territory.
