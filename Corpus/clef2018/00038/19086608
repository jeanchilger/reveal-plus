Definitive chemoradiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer with N2 disease. The treatment of NSCLC continues to evolve over time. Newer therapies and techniques help achieve success in this difficult disease. Since the 1970s, one can observe trends in median survival and notice that they have improved from 9 to 10 months to now 15 to 24 months with concurrent chemoradiation. Unfortunately, despite the advances made, most patients still die from their disease. Chemoradiation without induction or consolidation therapy continues to remain the standard of care in this country for unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. Evaluation of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other biologics continue to be investigated but are not considered standard of care yet. Technologies continue to expand including the use of four-dimensional CT scans and PET scans to more accurately plan patients. Future application of molecular profiling to predict patients most likely to benefit from tailored chemotherapeutic approaches is awaited following validation in early- and advanced-stage disease. With continued diligence to testing new ideas in NSCLC, it is hoped that outcomes will continue to improve the lives of patients with this devastating disease.
