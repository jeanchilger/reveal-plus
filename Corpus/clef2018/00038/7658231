Simultaneous emission and transmission measurements for attenuation correction in whole-body PET. We describe a methodology for measuring and correcting for attenuation in whole-body PET using simultaneous emission and transmission (SET) measurements.The main components of the methodology are: (a) sinogram windowing of low activity (< or = 50 MBq) rotating 68Ge/Ga rod sources, (b) segmented attenuation correction (SAC) and (c) maximum likelihood reconstruction using the ordered subsets EM (OS-EM) algorithm. The methods were implemented on a whole-body positron emission tomograph. Quantitative accuracy and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were measured for a thorax-tumor phantom as functions of acquisition time (range: 2-20 min per position).When a typical rod source activity (200 MBq 68Ge/Ga) was used, emission SNR was 60% lower in simultaneous than in separate measurements. The difference was only 14% when the rods contained 45 MBq 68Ge/Ga. The SNR was further improved by SAC in conjunction with OS-EM reconstruction and the relative gain increased with increasing acquisition time. Quantitative estimates of tumor, liver and lung radioactivity agreed with values obtained from a separate high count measurement to within 8%, independent of acquisition time.Attenuation correction of whole-body PET images is feasible using SET measurements. There is good quantitative agreement with conventional methods and increased noise is offset by the use of SAC and OS-EM reconstruction.
