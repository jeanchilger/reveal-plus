The immunity induced by recombinant spike proteins of SARS coronavirus in Balb/c mice. The immune effect of two recombinant protein fragments of spike protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) was investigated in Balb/c mice. Two partial spike gene fragments S1 (322 1464 bp) and S2 (2170 2814 bp) of SARS coronavirus were amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into pET-23a prokaryotic expression vector, then transformed into competent Escherichia E. coli BL21 (DE3)(pLysS) respectively. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified by Ni2+ immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The purified proteins mixed with complete Freund adjuvant were injected into Balb/c mice three times at a two-week interval. High titer antibody was detected in the serum of immunized Balb/c mice, and mice immunized with S1 protein produced high titer IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3, while those immunized with S2 protein produced high titer IgG1, IgG2a, but lower titer IgG2b and IgG3. Serum IFN-concentration was increased significantly but the concentrations of Il-2, IL-4 and IL-10 had no significant change. And a marked increase was observed in the number of spleen CD8+ T cells. The results showed that recombinant proteins of SARS coronavirus spike protein induced hormonal and cellular immune response in Balb/c mice.
