Medium to large scale radioisotope production for targeted radiotherapy using a small PET cyclotron. In recent years the use of radionuclides in targeted cancer therapy has increased. In this study we have developed a high-current solid target system and demonstrated that by the use of a typical low-energy medical cyclotron, it is possible to produce tens of GBq's of many unconventional radionuclides relevant for cancer therapy such as (64)Cu and (119)Sb locally at the hospitals.
