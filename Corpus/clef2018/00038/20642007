 Benzodiazepines are potent psychoactive drugs used for their sedative and anxiolytic properties (1, 2). There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors, which have been designated as the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). PBR is also known as the translocator protein (TSPO). CBR is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled with the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, PBR is a mitochondrial protein found in brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4). The brain has lower levels of PBR than do peripheral tissues, while both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBR (5-7). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage that accompanies several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.
