Multimodality equipment. A new vision in imaging diagnosis. Multimodality can be defined as a technique that brings together information obtained simultaneously from different imaging techniques in a single exploration to one patient. It encompasses joint assistance, teaching and investigation of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine in some of its techniques. It arose at the beginning of the XXI century with the development of equipment such as SPECT-CT, PET-CT and PET-MRI, able to achieve a better attenuation correction and to obtain fused images known as "corregistrated images". With the emergence of this equipment the need arises to consider new ways for the management of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine Departments, establishing diagnostic imaging Units combining both specialties. Similarly, the training of future specialists in these fields needs a specific training program in these new health technologies.
