An object-oriented Monte Carlo simulator for 3D cylindrical positron tomographs. Monte Carlo simulation is a very powerful tool in understanding performances of positron tomographs as well as in assessing image reconstruction algorithms and their implementations. We present an object-oriented Monte Carlo simulator developed for 3D positron tomography. Results from phantom simulation studies including absorption and scattering of the photons in the field-of-view are presented. Scatter fractions determined from these studies are in good agreement with measured scatter fractions published in the literature. Limitations and future prospects are discussed.
