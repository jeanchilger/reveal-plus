Surgery for nonsmall cell lung cancer: can improvements be made? Low-dose spiral computed tomography (CT) for the earlier detection of lung cancer is at the stage of producing hypothesis-generating studies. These studies have shown that more cancers are found at a favourable stage (IA) in prevalence screening but that the fewer numbers found in incidence screening tend to have a slightly worse stage. Randomised controlled trials will be necessary to resolve the place of spiral CT screening. The role of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy before surgery in nonsmall cell lung cancer looks less promising than suggested by earlier studies and the place of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery appears to be unhelpful, although results of some large, randomised international studies are still awaited. Radical radiotherapy is a poor alternative to surgery in resectable patients who refuse or are unfit for surgery and postoperative radiotherapy is detrimental. Positron emission tomography scanning offers a genuine opportunity to identify occult disease and improve staging prior to surgery and therefore save futile thoracotomies in approximately 20% of patients otherwise apparently suitable for resection.
