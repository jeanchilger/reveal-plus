Intraoperative microwave ablation of pulmonary malignancies with tumor permittivity feedback control: ablation and resection study in 10 consecutive patients. To determine histologic changes induced by microwave ablation (MWA) in patients with pulmonary malignancy by using an ablation system with tumor permittivity feedback control, enabling real-time modulation of energy power and frequency.Institutional review board approval and patient informed consent were obtained for this prospective HIPAA-complaint ablation and resection study. Between March 2009 and January 2010, 10 patients (four women, six men mean age, 71 yearsTumors included adenocarcinomas (n = 5), squamous cell carcinomas (n = 3), and metastases from endometrial (n = 1) and colorectal (n = 1) primary carcinomas. Mean maximum tumor diameter was 2.4 cm (range, 0.9-5.0 cm), and mean maximum volume was 8.6 cm(3) (range, 0.5-52.7 cm(3)). One air leak was detected. Five of 10 specimens were grossly measurable, revealing a mean maximum ablation zone diameter of 4.8 cm (range, 3.0-6.5 cm) and a mean maximum ablation zone volume of 15.1 cm(3) (range, 7.3-25.1 cm(3)). At hematoxylin-eosin staining, coagulation necrosis was observed in all ablation zones, extended into the normal lung in nine of 10 specimens, and up to blood vessel walls without evidence of vessel (>4 mm) thrombosis. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide staining enabled confirmation of no viability within ablation zones extending into normal lung in five of six specimens.MWA with tumor permittivity feedback control results in cytotoxic intratumoral temperatures and extension of ablation zones into aerated peritumoral pulmonary parenchyma, possibly forming the equivalent of an oncologic resection margin.
