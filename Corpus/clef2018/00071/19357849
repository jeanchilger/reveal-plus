Risk stratification and treatment of cardiac amyloidoses. Cardiac amyloidoses are a heterogeneous group of cardiomyopathies that are resistant to treatment and are associated with a poor outcome. Standard heart failure treatment is usually not well tolerated and the underlying disease remains unaffected. The clinical picture is uncharacteristic. Cardiac amyloidosis is often associated with dysfunction of additional organs. Early cardiac amyloid involvement usually reveals left ventricular hypertrophy, impairment of longitudinal shortening and diastolic ventricular function. Without adequate therapy (bi-)ventricular hypertrophy will progress to severe systolic ventricular function decrease. The combination of low voltage pattern, left ventricular hypertrophy and granular sparkling is characteristic for advanced cardiac amyloid involvement. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and scintigraphy yield further information on the pattern and severity of cardiac involvement. In unclear cases (left ventricular) endomyocardial biopsy is necessary. Detection of early cardiac involvement and proper identification of patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death due to rapid progressive amyloidosis is still incompletely defined. Referral to specialized centers is strongly recommended.
