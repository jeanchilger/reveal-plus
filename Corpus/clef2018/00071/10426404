Deblurring. In most instances, traditional EEG methodology provides insufficient spatial detail to identify relationships between brain electrical events and structures and functions visualized by magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography. This article describes a method called Deblurring for increasing the spatial detail of the EEG and for fusing neurophysiologic and neuroanatomic data. Deblurring estimates potentials near the outer convexity of the cortex using a realistic finite element model of the structure of a subject's head determined from their magnetic resonance images. Deblurring is not a source localization technique and thus makes no assumptions about the number or type of generator sources. The validity of Deblurring has been initially tested by comparing deblurred data with potentials measured with subdural grid recordings. Results suggest that deblurred topographic maps, registered with a subject's magnetic resonance imaging and rendered in three dimensions, provide better spatial detail than has heretofore been obtained with scalp EEG recordings. Example results are presented from research studies of somatosensory stimulation, movement, language, attention and working memory. Deblurred ictal EEG data are also presented, indicating that this technique may have future clinical application as an aid to seizure localization and surgical planning.
