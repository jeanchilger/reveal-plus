Fetal magnetic resonance imaging of an intracranial venous thrombosis. Case report. To describe the magnetic resonance imaging findings of an antenatal intracranial venous thrombosis.Prenatal ultrasound (US) at 22 weeks' gestational age (GA) in a 27-year-old patient (G2 P1) revealed a nonspecific avascular echogenic mass above the cerebellum evaluated with MRI at 23 weeks' GA.With MRI an enlarged occipital pericerebral space with a layered ovoid mass at the torcular herophili was demonstrated and MRI characteristics suggested a subacute cloth. In follow-up, an important enlargement of the mass was noticed on US examinations. After multidisciplinary consult and parental consent, a prostaglandin induction was performed at 25 weeks' GA. The baby died immediately after birth. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of a venous thrombosis at the torcular herophili with extension into the superior sagittal sinus.In our case, MRI findings were helpful in diagnosing an intracranial fetal venous thrombosis.
