Pediatric cerebellar stroke associated with elevated titer of antibodies to β2-glycoprotein. Antibodies to 2-glycoprotein I (anti-2GPI) have been associated with recurrent thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. However, the prevalence of anti-2GPI in children suffering from cerebral and cerebellar infarction is unknown. We report on a 10-month-old boy who had an ischemic cerebellar stroke, secondary to antiphospholipid syndrome with high titers of immunoglobulin G anti-2GPI (first titer: 132U) anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant tests were negative. All other causes of infarction were excluded. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of childhood cerebellar ischemic stroke with only anti-2GPI but no antibodies detectable in standard antiphospholipid assays.
