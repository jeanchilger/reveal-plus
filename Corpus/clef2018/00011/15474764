Headaches in pregnancy. Migraine and TTH are primary headache disorders that occur commonly during pregnancy. Migraine sometimes occurs for the first time with pregnancy. The majority of migraineurs improve while pregnant however, migraine often recurs post partum. Some disorders that produce, headache, such as stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, eclampsia, and SAH, occur more frequently during pregnancy. Diagnostic testing serves to exclude organic causes of headache, to confirm the diagnosis, and to establish a baseline before treatment. If neurodiagnostic testing is indicated, the study that provides the most information with the least fetal risk is the study of choice. Drugs commonly are used during pregnancy despite insufficient knowledge about their effects on the growing fetus. Most drugs are not teratogenic. Adverse effects, such as spontaneous abortion, developmental defects, and various postnatal effects, depend on the dosage and route of administration and the timing of the exposure relative to the period of fetal development. Although medication use should be limited, it is not absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. In migraine, the risk for status migrainosus may be greater than the potential risk of the medication used to treat the pregnant patient. Nonpharmacologic treatment is the ideal solution
