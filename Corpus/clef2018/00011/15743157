Primary thrombophilia. Report of 93 cases and 12 asymptomatic relatives. Thrombophilia is defined as an altered hemostasis that predisposes to thrombosis. It can be primary when there is a family clustering of the disease or secondary, when it is associated to an acquired risk factor.To report clinical features in a series of patients with primary thrombophilia.Review of clinical records of patients with thrombotic episodes that lead to the suspicions of primary thrombophilia. Analysis of asymptomatic adult close relatives of these patients.We report 93 subjects (56 females, age range 14-77 years) with repeated episodes of thrombosis and a family history of thrombosis and 12 asymptomatic close relatives. Seventy one percent had the first thrombotic episode before the age of 40 years, 62% had more than one thrombotic episode and 37% had a family history of thrombosis. Twenty four percent had protein C deficiency, 24% had antithrombin III deficiency, 18% had resistance to activated C protein by factor V Leiden, 10% had protein S deficiency, and 10% had the G20210 mutation of prothrombin gene. Among acquired defects studied simultaneously, 30% had lupus anticoagulant and 11% had hyperhomocysteinemia. Twenty four percent of cases had more than one thrombophilic risk factor. Among asymptomatic relatives, five had factor V Leiden, four had protein C deficiency and three had the G20210 mutation of prothrombin gene.Thrombophilia must be suspected in young subjects with thrombotic episodes and a family history. The type of coagulation defect will determine prognosis, and the type of treatment.
