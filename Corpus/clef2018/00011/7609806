Postpartum complication: 'postpartum headache' (thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus). A 34-year-old woman was admitted on the 10th day post partum complaining of loss of strength in the left arm and headache. The next day she started having seizures. Although the clinical picture suggested sinus thrombosis, initially a CT scan showed no abnormalities. The diagnosis of sinus sagittalis superior thrombosis was finally made by means of arteriography. The patient was treated successfully with anticoagulants and recovered without sequelae.
