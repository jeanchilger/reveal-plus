Ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of ovarian vein thrombosis in obstetrical and nonobstetrical patients. Ovarian vein thrombosis is an uncommon clinical entity, most familiar to radiologists as a source of postpartum sepsis, which, if unrecognized and left untreated, has the potential for septic shock, pulmonary thromboembolism, and death. Ovarian vein thrombosis also occurs with other common inflammatory and malignant conditions in the nonobstetrical patient. This article reviews the pathophysiology, predisposing conditions, clinical findings, imaging features on ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of acute and chronic ovarian vein thrombosis and its appropriate clinical management.
