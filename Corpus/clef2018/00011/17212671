Cerebral venous thrombosis and hepatic venous thrombosis during pregnancy. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) are rarely encountered thrombotic diseases of two different vascular systems. A 20-year-old woman in the 14th week of pregnancy was brought to the emergency department with complaints of sudden headache and loss of vision. Thrombosis in the left transverse and sigmoid sinus was demonstrated at MR angiography. She was diagnosed with BCS by using hepatic Doppler ultrasonography after an elevation of liver enzymes. Although CVT and BCS are rarely seen during pregnancy, they need emergency treatment because of high mortality.
