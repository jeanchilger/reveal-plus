Diagnosis of acute neurological emergencies in pregnant and post-partum women. Acute neurological symptoms in pregnant and post-partum women could be caused by exacerbation of a pre-existing neurological condition, the initial presentation of a non-pregnancy-related problem, or a new acute-onset neurological problem that is either unique to or occurs with increased frequency during or just after pregnancy. Pregnant and postpartum patients with headache and neurological symptoms are often diagnosed with pre-eclampsia however, a range of other causes must also be considered, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Precise diagnosis is essential to guide subsequent management. Our ability to differentiate between the specific causes of acute neurological symptoms in pregnant and post-partum patients is likely to improve as we learn more about the pathogenesis of these disorders.
