Budd-Chiari syndrome complicating severe preeclampsia in a parturient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. A 27-year-old primipara with severe preeclampsia and primary antiphospholipid syndrome developed right upper quadrant pain, massive ascites, HELLP syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation shortly following vaginal delivery. Computed tomography and color Doppler studies were compatible with complete thrombosis of the right hepatic veins, the Budd-Chiari syndrome. Anticoagulation was initiated, along with supportive measures, and the patient recovered completely. Imaging studies 6 months later were normal. This case demonstrates that nearly fatal forms of venous thrombosis may complicate preeclampsia in women with antiphospholipid syndrome Doppler studies of the hepatic vein are of value in establishing the diagnosis.
