Pulmonary embolism in adolescents. Pulmonary embolism is rare in children, but its incidence is probably underestimated. While its causes are the same as in adults, the role of clotting factor deficiency and oral contraceptive agents has recently been stressed.Case n. 1: A 15 year-old girl was immobilized for an ankle strain. She developed thrombophlebitis of the deep veins of the right leg. The condition was confirmed by Doppler. A phlebogram showed a clot floating in the inferior vena cava. This required the insertion of a clip around it and further thrombectomy. Despite immediate intravenous heparin therapy, the adolescent died of a massive pulmonary embolization. The girl had a congenital antithrombin III deficiency she was also taking an oral contraceptive. Case n. 2: A 15 year-old suffered from left thoracic pain radiating to the shoulder. Perfusion scintiphotography showed evidence of pulmonary embolism of the left inferior lobe and a phlebogram showed thrombosis of the hypogastric veins. This adolescent was 4 months pregnant. A filter was placed inside the inferior vena cava to permit therapeutic interruption of the pregnancy. The girl was treated with intravenous heparin, followed by antivitamin K with an uneventful course. She suffered from no clotting factor deficiency.Pulmonary embolism remains a severe complication of thrombi in the femoral and pelvic veins. It can occur in adolescents, especially those with a congenital clotting factor deficiency, those on oral contraceptives or those who are pregnant.
