Internal carotid artery dissection: an unusual cause of postpartum headache. We report a case of postpartum headache caused by internal carotid artery dissection in a 36-year-old woman following uneventful epidural analgesia for spontaneous labor and vaginal delivery. Cervicocerebral arterial dissection requires rapid diagnosis and anticoagulation to prevent thrombus formation and to avoid secondary cerebral thromboembolism. Fortunately, our patient suffered ischemic symptoms, but no permanent neurologic deficit. Anesthesiologists should consider carotid artery dissection in the differential diagnosis of postpartum headache.
