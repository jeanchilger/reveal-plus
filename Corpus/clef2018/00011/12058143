Post-partum cerebral thrombophlebitis: three cases. Post-partum cerebral thrombophlebitis is a rare accident (1/3000 to 1/10000 births). Symptoms vary and may be misleading. We report three cases of cerebral thrombophlebitis occurring during the pospartum period where diagnosis was based on clinical signs and imaging data (computed tomography and cerebral angiography). Heparin therapy led to good outcome in all three cases. Heparin therapy has been controversial for these patients but recent work has shown improvement in this severe conditions with very poor prognosis.
