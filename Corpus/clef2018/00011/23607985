Parkes-Weber syndrome and pregnancy: anaesthetic implications. We report two deliveries in a patient with a Parkes-Weber syndrome. This parturient had a complex angiodysplasia including a soft tissue hypertrophy of a lower limb, a cutaneous angioma and arteriovenous malformations. The risk of perimedullar arteriovenous malformations was ruled out by angiographic magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord. We also describe other aspects of the management, including prepartum cardiovascular assessment, mode of delivery, the use of epidural analgesia and the prevention of haemorrhagia and thromboembolism.
