Postpartum thrombosis of the great vein of Galen. Severe fits occurred in a patient 52 hours after placental abruption. Early use of computerised tomography scanning enabled a definitive diagnosis of thrombosis of the great vein of Galen to be made. The case illustrates the point that not all fits in the early postpartum period should be attributed to eclamptic toxaemia.
