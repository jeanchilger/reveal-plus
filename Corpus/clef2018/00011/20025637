Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in early pregnancy: an unusual presentation of primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, an unusual presentation of antiphospholipid syndrome, is a rare condition in pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. The authors of this case report present the case of a 20-year-old woman with sudden onset of headaches and hemiparesis in the first trimester of pregnancy. She underwent a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging. The image findings and the autoimmune serum test were consistent with a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis complicated by primary antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient's hemiparesis improved with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin and oral aspirin. In the third trimester of pregnancy, she developed seizures that were controlled by antiepileptic drugs. She delivered a healthy baby at 37 weeks' gestation without immediate or late postpartum complications.
