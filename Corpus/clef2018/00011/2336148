A case of surgical excision of intracerebral cavernous angioma in a patient with thrombasthenia. A case of thrombasthenia (Glanzmann) associated with an intracerebral cavernous angioma in a 32-year-old woman is reported. Since her childhood, the patient had experienced a tendency to develop purpura following minor trauma. But she had not had major bleeding even during pregnancy and delivery. On April 4, 1987, she presented generalized convulsion. A high density mass in the right temporal lobe was demonstrated with CT scan. Carotid angiogram was normal except that the right anterior choroidal artery was stretched. Inhomogeneous signal intensities in T1- and T2-weighted MRI images were seen in the tumor locus. The clinical diagnosis was cavernous angioma which was complicated with intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient had a disorder of platelet function without thrombocytopenia. Her bleeding time was markedly prolonged. Because of this, we did not try surgical excision at first. During the 13-month observation period, however, intracerebral bleeding occurred 5 times. We decided to operate on the patient using fresh blood and platelet transfusion. The postoperative course was uneventful and pathological diagnosis confirmed cavernous angioma. We would like to emphasize possible pitfalls in treating cases of intracerebral angioma with thrombasthenia.
