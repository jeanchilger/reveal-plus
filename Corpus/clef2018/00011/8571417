Long-term prognosis in cerebral venous thrombosis. Follow-up of 77 patients. Very little is known about the long-term outcome of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), particularly regarding the risk of residual epilepsy and further thrombotic events. We retrospectively studied 77 patients with CVT diagnosed by angiography and/or MRI.A cohort of 77 patients aged 18 to 77 (mean, 38.5) years with CVT, evaluated from 1975 through 1990, was followed up for a mean of 77.8 months (range, 14 to 204 months median, 63 months). Information on death, neurological status, seizures, recurrent CVT, other thrombotic events, and subsequent pregnancies was obtained from direct observation, mail questionnaire, or telephone interviews.Sixty-six of 77 patients (85.7%) had no neurological sequelae during follow-up. Eleven patients (14.3%) remained neurologically impaired. Two who initially presented with isolated intracranial hypertension had blindness due to optic atrophy. The other 9 had focal signs at the time of CVT and were left with various cognitive or focal deficits. Four of 28 (14.3%) patients who had seizures at the acute stage had recurrent seizures. One of the 51 patients with lateral sinus thrombosis developed a dural arteriovenous fistula. Nine of the 77 patients (11.7%) suffered a second CVT, all but one in the first year. Noncerebral thrombotic events occurred in 11 patients (14.3%). No recurrence of CVT occurred during later pregnancies, but 1 patient had a postpartum deep vein thrombosis.In the present series, CVT has an essentially good long-term prognosis. The frequency of long-standing epilepsy was low, suggesting that long-term anticonvulsant treatment is not necessary in the majority of cases. A second CVT or another thrombotic episode occurred in 20% of patients, stressing the need in a minority of cases for long-term anticoagulation.
