The second trimester Doppler ultrasound examination is the best predictor of late pregnancy outcome in systemic lupus erythematosus and/or the antiphospholipid syndrome. To examine the predictive value of clinical examination, laboratory tests and Doppler ultrasound examination in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) pregnancies.A prospective study of 116 pregnancies followed in a single tertiary referral centre. Outcomes analysed were fetal/neonatal death and adverse pregnancy outcome. Univariate analysis was performed for: (i) medical and obstetric history (ii) medical and obstetric clinical examinationSixteen out of 116 pregnancies ended in 12 fetal deaths and 4 embryonic losses. Hence, data for 100 pregnancies were analysed. Seven fetal deaths and one neonatal death occurred, associated with abnormal end-diastolic umbilical artery Doppler flow at the second trimester (P < 0.006), a history of thrombophlebitis (P < 0.001) or notched uterine artery and growth restriction at the second trimester (P < 0.002). Multivariate analysis retained abnormal end-diastolic umbilical artery Doppler flow (P = 0.047) and history of thrombophlebitis (P = 0.018) as significant predictors. Thirty-one adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred, associated with notched uterine artery (P < 0.00003), abnormal end-diastolic umbilical artery Doppler flow (P < 0.0006) and fetal growth restriction at the second trimester (P < 0.008), growth restriction (P < 0.00001) and notched uterine artery at the third trimester (P < 0.0008), use of heparin (P < 0.05) and history of thrombophlebitis (P < 0.04). Notched uterine artery at the second trimester remained the only predictor in multivariate analysis (P = 0.001).Results of the second trimester Doppler ultrasound examination are the best predictors for late pregnancy outcome in SLE and/or APS.
