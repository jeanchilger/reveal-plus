Intracranial meningioma with progesterone positive receptors presenting in late pregnancy. A 36-year-old female presented with seizures and transient dysphasia in her 31 week of pregnancy. Neuroradiological investigations revealed a large falx meningioma. A decision was taken to deliver the infant and excise the tumor before term because of the risk of an increase in the size of the tumour and the risk of sinus thrombosis. Therefore, she underwent in her 32 week of pregnancy an elective Caesarean section followed by a craniotomy to remove the meningioma. There were no neonatal complications and she made an uneventful recovery. The final pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of meningioma with progesterone positive receptors.
