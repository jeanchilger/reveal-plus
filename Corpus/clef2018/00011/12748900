Clinical presentation and management of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In February 2003, a newly emerged infectious disease was described, the etiology of which was initially unknown. It is referred to under the term SARS. In the beginning, it spread in some regions South-East Asia. Import infections appeared in many other parts of the world. Based on the first cases in Germany, this report illustrates the clinical appearance, the diagnostic results and the management of this new disease.We analysed the data of two patients with SARS and one suspected patient. The results of radiological, laboratory, microbiological and physical examinations were abstracted and compared with the data obtained in other regions.Two of the three patients under our care developed SARS disease. This is characterised by fever of sudden onset lasting for more than 5 days, rapidly changing consolidations in chest x-ray not affected by antimicrobial therapy, leuko-, lympho- as well as thrombopenia with a compromised pulmonary function later in the course. Close contacts with SARS patients does not regularly result in full development of the disease. Secretion of a coronavirus could be detected in respiratory samples during the febrile phase and in feces for a longer time. It is still an open question whether bedrest and antibiotic prophylaxis by themselves or an additional administration of ribavirin and corticosteroids can improve the outcome.SARS is a new and highly contagious lung disease. It is crucial to be able to recognize the clinical appearance and the diagnostic features of this disease at an early stage, in order to prevent a further dissemination of the disease.
