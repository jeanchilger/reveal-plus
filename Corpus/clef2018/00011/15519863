Intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms. Six patients with intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms (ICCAAns) were seen at our department from 1998 to 2002. All patients had only one intracranial aneurysm and their ages at diagnosis ranged from 36 to 72 years (median 56). Five were women and four had a history of hypertension. One patient was pregnant. All of the ICCAAns were symptomatic at diagnosis. Duration of symptoms was 2-30 days. On admission to our department, initial symptom was headache in four patients, visual loss in two, eye pain in one, third nerve paresis in two and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in one. Spontaneous thrombosis was present in two patients. All of the ICCAAns were saccular. Computed tomography (CT) was superior when compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis of ICCAAns on admission. Angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis and determination of specific anatomical details, which are necessary to plan treatment.
