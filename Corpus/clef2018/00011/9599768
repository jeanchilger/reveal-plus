Postpartum cerebral thrombophlebitis. A case secondary to acquired antithrombin III deficiency. The cerebral thrombophlebitis is a rare complication of the pregnancy and the postpartum. We report a case of a 21 year-woman presenting a post-partum cerebral thrombophlebitis, secondary to an acquired deficiency of antithrombin III. The clinical symptoms of cerebral thrombophlebitis can be misleading. The angiography and the magnetic resonance imaging permit the diagnosis. The treatment is relied on anticoagulating heparin therapy. This treatment will be adapted in case of coagulation's factors deficiency that must be searched in any thromboembolic accident having an unusual localization.
