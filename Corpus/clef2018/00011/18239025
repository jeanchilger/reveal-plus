Thrombosed fetal dural sinus malformation diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging. Dural sinus malformations are rare congenital forms of dural arteriovenous shunt. Our goal is to describe prenatal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of a thrombosed midline dural venous malformation.Second-trimester fetal ultrasonography and MRI demonstrated a large T2-hypointense mass centered at the level of the torcular Herophili consistent with complete thrombosis of a dural sinus malformation. A follow-up third-trimester MRI showed decreased thrombus size and no parenchymal injury. A neurologically intact newborn was delivered.Dural sinus malformations can lead to fetal intracranial thrombosis. Prenatal imaging is useful to establish the diagnosis of dural sinus malformations and to plan perinatal management and treatment options.
