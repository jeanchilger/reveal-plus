Characteristics of deep vein thrombosis associated with prolonged travel. to identify the incidence of prolonged travel among consecutive patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and to investigate any differences in the patterns of traveller's thrombosis versus DVT's with no history of prolonged recent travel.of 137 consecutive patients, who were confirmed to have DVT by duplex ultrasonography, 36 were excluded because of either prolonged immobilisation or recent surgery. All patients were asked whether they had travelled within 2 weeks for more than 3h. The presence of other classic risk factors for DVT was also recorded. Patients who were unlikely to travel as a result of prolonged immobility for more than 2 weeks and those who underwent surgery within 2 weeks were excluded from the study. The extent and location of thrombi was also verified by duplex scanning in each patient.of 101 patients, eligible for the final analysis, 15 (15%) claimed to have a recent travel, of whom 9 (9%) travelled by air. By comparison of a group of 106 patients with similar symptoms at presentation, but who had negative duplex finding 12 (11%) had a history of prolonged travel (p=0.8, Fisher's exact test). Travel-related DVT occurred to a significantly younger age group than non travellers. Thirteen (87%) out of 15 patients with travel-related DVT had another coexisting risk factor and 7 out of 10 patients had a positive thrombophilia screen.The majority of those with travel-related DVT had other concomitant risk factors and a high incidence of a positive thrombophilia screen, suggesting that travel itself may act as an additive risk among those with pre-existing risk factors for DVT.
