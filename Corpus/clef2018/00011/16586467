Spontaneous resolution of prenatally diagnosed dural sinus thrombosis: a case report. Fetal thrombosis of the dural sinus is an extremely rare congenital cerebrovascular condition that is potentially fatal. We report a case of dural sinus thrombosis diagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography and fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the second trimester. The thrombosis showed partial resolution during pregnancy and resolved spontaneously after birth without neurological complications. This is the first report of spontaneous postnatal resolution, and may provide helpful information on the natural history and prenatal counseling of fetal thrombosis of the dural sinus.
