Early metabolic response evaluation after stereotactic radiotherapy for lung cancer: pilot experience with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography. The early response of lung tumours to stereotactic radiotherapy was prospectively evaluated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Three months after treatment, the maximum standardised uptake value and the tumour diameter fell by 64 and 30%, respectively. This imaging strategy therefore remains under ongoing evaluation with the aim of identifying predictive and prognostic factors.
