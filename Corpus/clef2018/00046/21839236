Value of 18-FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography before and after transarterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing liver transplantation: initial results. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for various types of end-stage liver disease and the most appropriate alternative for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated liver cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to describe our initial experience with the use of 18-FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography CT before and after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC patients undergoing liver transplantation, seeking to predict the percentage of tumor necrosis achieved by TACE procedures.From January 2007 through December 2009, 39 patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis were included in our liver transplantation program. We selected the 6 subjects who underwent 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (18-FDG PET/CT) pre- and post-TACE.The median SUV (standardized uptake value) in the lesions studied were 4 (range, 2.79-6.95) before TACE with a median post-TACE SUV of 0 (range, 0-4). Among patients whose post-TACE SUV decreased to <3, the percentage of necrosis after studying the hepatectomy was >80%.Performance of an 18-FDG PET/CT before and after TACE and comparison of SUV in patients with HCC awaiting liver transplantation provided valuable information regarding the effectiveness of TACE.
