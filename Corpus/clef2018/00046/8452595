Hemimegalencephaly: evaluation with positron emission tomography. We performed positron emission tomographic (PET) studies with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose in 8 children with hemimegalencephaly (HME). HME is a developmental brain malformation associated with epilepsy, hemianopsia, and varying degrees of developmental delay. We hypothesized that the relatively poor overall developmental outcome of surgically hemispherectomized HME patients as a group, compared to children undergoing hemispherectomy for Sturge-Weber syndrome or chronic focal encephalitis, is related to dysfunction of the structurally "normal" non-HME side and that PET would be helpful in the pre-surgical evaluation of HME patients with intractable epilepsy. Visual analysis of the non-HME side on PET clearly revealed evidence of cortical hypometabolism in 4 patients compared to controls. Seven children underwent epilepsy surgery. One child had a glucose metabolic pattern suggesting a cortical lamination defect in the non-HME hemisphere, bilateral independent seizure onset, and was not considered to be a surgical candidate. We found a general correlation between the pattern of glucose utilization in the less affected hemisphere and prognosis. Although the follow-up periods are short, it is recommended that HME children with intractable epilepsy undergo hemispherectomy in the first year of life in order to allow maximal brain plasticity to occur however, preoperative evaluation should also include an assessment of the integrity of the non-HME hemisphere.
