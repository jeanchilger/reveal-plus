Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of novel PET probes for P-glycoprotein function and expression. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-dependent efflux pump protecting the body against xenobiotics. A P-gp substrate (7) and an inhibitor (6) were labeled with (11)C, resulting in potential tracers of P-gp function and expression.6 and 7 were labeled using (11)CH(3)I. (11)C-verapamil was prepared as published previously, using (11)C-methyl triflate. MicroPET scans (with arterial sampling) and biodistribution studies were performed in rats pretreated with saline, cyclosporin A (CsA, 50 mg/kg), or cold 6 (15 mg/kg).The radiochemical yields of (11)C-6 and (11)C-7 were approximately 30% with a total synthesis time of 45 min. Cerebral distribution volumes (DV) of (11)C-6 (2.35 +/- 0.11) and (11)C-7 (1.86 +/- 0.15) in saline-treated rats were higher than of (11)C-verapamil (0.64 +/- 0.12). DVs of (11)C-7 and (11)C-verapamil were significantly increased by CsA (to 5.26 +/- 0.14 and 5.85 +/- 0.32, respectively). The DV of (11)C-6 was reduced by cold 6 (to 1.65 +/- 0.03). Its uptake was also reduced (up to 67%) in several peripheral organs that express P-gp.(11)C-7 is a novel tracer of P-gp function with higher baseline uptake than (11)C-verapamil. Upregulation of P-gp function in response to treatment (which is hard to detect with (11)C-verapamil) may be detectable using (11)C-7 and PET. Because (11)C-6 shows specific binding in target organs, this compound is the first PET tracer allowing measurement of P-gp expression.
