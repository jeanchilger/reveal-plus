Positron emitters for the study of tumor metabolism. Positron emission tomography with metabolically active substances is a noninvasive imaging modality to determine tumor metabolism. Quantification of tumor metabolism provides valuable information, e.g., for the differential diagnosis of malignancies. Radiolabeled therapeutic substances can be traced with PET. Measurement of fluorouracil metabolite concentrations provides data about the accumulation pattern of the cytostatic agent and allows assessment of the therapeutic outcome.
