The nervous system in early HIV infection: a prospective study through 7 years. In this study 28 patients with early stage HIV infection (CD4 >280 x 10(6)/l) were subjected to yearly examinations of the nervous system up to 7 years in order to detect any deterioration. Clinical neurological as well as neuropsychological performance was evaluated. The patients also underwent yearly neurophysiological tests (digital EEG, visual evoked potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials, auditory evoked potentials P300 and electroneurography). Every other year, SPECT with (99m)Tc-D,L-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime and brain MRI were performed. Originally, 38 patients were included in the study but only the results of 28 patients who complied with three of more yearly check-ups are presented. The results of yearly investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been presented earlier [Eur J Neurol4 (1997) 1]. All the patients showed signs of HIV in the CSF. Yet, no major deterioration in the neurological, psychological performance, neurophysiological or neuroimaging examinations could be discerned.
