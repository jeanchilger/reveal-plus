Single photon emission tomography findings in lacunar lesions. 99-Tc hexamethyl propylene amine oxime single photon emission tomography was performed in 18 patients showing typical lacunar hypodensities on CT scan (3 with Binswanger's disease and 3 with acute-stage lacunar syndrome). Reduced radiouptake in the site of the lacunar lesions was observed in 7 out of the 18 patients, while all of the patients with Binswanger's disease showed a bilateral reduced whithe matter uptake. Two of the three acute-stage lacunar syndrome patients showed a reduced radio uptake in the cortical areas of the hemisphere, in which the lacunar lesion was detected (diaschisis), followed by subsequent normalization and clinical improvement.
