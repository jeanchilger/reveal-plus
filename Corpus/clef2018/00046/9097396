Imaging of cholinergic terminals using the radiotracer [18F](+)-4-fluorobenzyltrozamicol: in vitro binding studies and positron emission tomography studies in nonhuman primates. The goal of the present set of studies was to characterize the in vitro binding properties and in vivo tissue kinetics for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAcChT) radiotracer, [18F](+)-4-fluorobenzyltrozamicol ([18F](+)-FBT). In vitro binding studies were conducted in order to determine the affinity of the (+)- and (-)-stereoisomers of FBT for the VAcChT as well as sigma (sigma 1 and sigma 2) receptors. (+)-FBT was found to have a high affinity (Ki = 0.22 nM) for the VAcChT and lower affinities for sigma 1 (21.6 nM) and sigma 2 (35.9 nM) receptors, whereas (-)-FBT had similar affinities for the VAcChT and sigma 1 receptors (approximately 20 nM) and a lower affinity for sigma 2 (110 nM) receptors. PET imaging studies were conducted in rhesus monkeys (n = 3) with [18F](+)-FBT. [18F](+)-FBT was found to have a high accumulation and slow rate of washout from the basal ganglia, which is consistent with the labeling of cholinergic interneurons in this brain region. [18F](+)-FBT also displayed reversible binding kinetics during the 3 h time course of PET and produced radiolabeled metabolites that did not cross the blood-brain barrier. The results from the current in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that [18F](+)-FBT is a promising ligand for studying cholinergic terminal density, with PET, via the VAcChT.
