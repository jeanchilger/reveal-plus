Moyamoya syndrome: impaired hemodynamics on ECD SPECT after EEG controlled hyperventilation. Ischemic symptoms in children with Moyamoya syndrome are typically provoked by hyperventilation (HV) and are accompanied by the "re-build-up" phenomenon in EEG. The value of scintigraphic detection of HV-provoked perfusion deficits remains to be elucidated.In seven children with Moyamoya syndrome regional cerebral blood flow was assessed by 99mTc-ethyl-cysteine-dimer (ECD) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after HV and under baseline conditions to identify ischemia prone regions.Regional marked hypoperfusion after HV was found in all patients. Predominant perfusion deficits were detected in the frontal lobes.ECD SPECT is a potential tool for the preoperative evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics and for monitoring angiosurgical therapies in Moyamoya disease.
