Serotonin-1A receptors in frontotemporal dementia compared with controls. Using PET neuroimaging, we demonstrated that four frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) patients had significantly decreased serotonin 5-HT(1A) binding potential (BP) compared with controls in all 10 brain regions examined. These pilot data suggest that profound 5-HT(1A) BP losses may be present and contribute to symptomatology and treatment response in FTLD.
