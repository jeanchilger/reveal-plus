Thoracic real-time MRI: experience from 2200 examinations in acute and ill-defined thoracic diseases. To retrospectively assess the indication for thoracic real-time MRI, demonstrate typical findings, analyze the diagnostic potential in subgroups with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and aortic dissection (AD), and describe the influence of real-time MRI on the role of MRI in acute thoracic diseases.From July 2001 to February 2005, real-time MRI was applied in 2,256 examinations in 1,714 patients. MRI was the primary diagnostic modality for these thoracic diseases as computed tomography has been available only since 2003. Characteristics of the TrueFISP sequence applied were: TR/TE/flip angle 3.1 ms/1.6 ms/59 degrees , respectively. FOV 340 - 360 mm, matrix size 156 to 192 x 256 pixels, slice thickness 3 to 4 mm, slices overlapped by 50 %. Acquisition time was 0.4 to 0.5 s per image. Three hundred and twenty transverse, coronal and sagittal images were acquired in three minutes. No breath holding, and only minimal patient cooperation, was required. Turbo-spin-echo sequences as well as ECG-gated and contrast-enhanced sequences were added depending on the indication.Most common indications were: acute thoracic nonspecified disease (n = 276, 12.24 %), PE (n = 573, 25.4 %), bleeding (n = 154, 6.8 %), AD (n = 222, 9.8 %), topographic information in complex findings (n = 654, 29.0 %). Real-time MRI was the sole MRI technique applied in 180 examinations (8.0 %), ECG-gated real-time MRI was applied in 87 examinations and breath hold was used in 107 examinations. PE was diagnosed in 181 examinations reference techniques (MRI, computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography) confirmed 170 of these and detected 19 more cases (sensitivity 90.0 %, specificity 97.1 %). Real-time MRI detected 141 suspected AD and 53 more nonsuspected AD. Of these, 191 were confirmed by other MRI techniques, surgery or clinical course (98.5 %). Real-time MRI coincidentally detected 56 pulmonary tumors, all were confirmed with computed tomography. Thus, especially vascular diseases could be easily assessed with real-time MRI, while computed tomography had advantages in the evaluation of the lung parenchyma.Real-time MRI both enables emergency MRI examinations for thoracic diseases in clinical patients in unstable condition and allows an explorative style of working in patients with nondefined acute thoracic diseases.
