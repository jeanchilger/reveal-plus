Optimal imaging protocols for lung cancer staging: CT, PET, MR imaging, and the role of imaging. Chest radiography, the most commonly performed imaging technique for the detection of lung disease, is limited in accurately detecting early lung cancer. The main imaging modality for the staging of lung cancer is computed tomography (CT), supplemented by positron emission tomography (PET), usually as a hybrid technique in conjunction with CT (PET/CT). Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a useful diagnostic tool for specific indications and has the advantage of not using ionizing radiation. This article discusses the optimal imaging protocols for lung cancer staging using CT, PET (PET/CT), and MR imaging, and the role of imaging in patient management.
