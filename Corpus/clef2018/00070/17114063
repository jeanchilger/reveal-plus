PET imaging of tumour hypoxia. Tumour hypoxia represents a significant challenge to the curability of human tumours leading to treatment resistance and enhanced tumour progression. Tumour hypoxia can be detected by non-invasive and invasive techniques but the inter-relationships between these remains largely undefined. [18F]Fluoromisonidazole-3-fluoro-1-(2'-nitro-1'-imidazolyl)-2-propanol ([18F]MISO) and Cu-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone (Cu-ATSM)-positron emission tomography (PET), and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the lead contenders for human application based on their non-invasive nature, ease of use and robustness, measurement of hypoxia status, validity, ability to demonstrate heterogeneity and general availability PET techniques are the primary focus of this review.
