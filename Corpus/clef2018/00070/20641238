 Growth factors such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF), the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the tumor necrosis factor are known to have important roles in the development and progression of cancers (1-3). The EGF mediates its activity through a group of tyrosine kinase (TK)–dependent EGF receptors (EGFR) that promote not only cell proliferation but also cell survival and the motility phenotype that is necessary for the development of an invasive cancer (4). As a consequence, the EGFRs and their associated TKs are the targets of several anti-EGFR antibodies and TK inhibitors that are either approved by the United Stated Food and Drug Administration or are being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of various neoplasms. Before treatment, the patients are screened to determine the extent of EGFR expression in the tumors with the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence
