Modalities to assess myocardial viability in the modern cardiology era. Detection of viable myocardium in patients with left ventricular dysfunction has become an increasingly important guide to prognosis and treatment. This article reviews the current status and future potential for the application of modalities to assess myocardial viability. Imaging and other techniques that are reviewed are myocardial perfusion imaging by single-photon-emission computed tomography, positron-emission tomography, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance technology, computed tomography and catheter-based endocardial mapping.
