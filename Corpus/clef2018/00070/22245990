Staging and imaging of small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been primarily classified as limited or extensive, with limited stage confined to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. In the future, the TNM staging system should be integrated into the classification of SCLC. The appropriate staging work-up for patients with SCLC has traditionally included contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen, bone scan, and magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan of the brain. Recent data suggest that positron emission tomography can improve both staging accuracy and treatment planning in patients with SCLC. Treatment for limited-stage SCLC consists of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, and such therapy can cure 20-25% of patients. Extensive-stage SCLC is incurable, but chemotherapy can improve quality of life and prolong life.
