Reproducibility of in vivo brain measures of 5-HT2A receptors with PET and. The test/retest reproducibility of brain measures of 5-HT2A receptors with positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]deuteroaltanserin was examined in a group of eight healthy human subjects. PET measures of 5-HT2A receptors were obtained under an equilibrium paradigm, with a 40-min PET acquisition starting approximately at 300 min (308+/-11 min) after bolus plus constant infusion of the radiotracer. Three brain outcome measures were obtained at equilibrium, V(3) (ratio of specific brain uptake to free parent plasma concentration of radiotracer), V(3)' (ratio of specific brain uptake to total parent plasma concentration) and RT (ratio of specific to non-displaceable brain uptakes). V(3)' and RT had high test/retest reproducibility, as measured by mean intra-subject% change for cortical brain areas of 14.1 and 11.0%, respectively. They also had high reliability, as measured by mean intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for cortical brain areas of 0.86 and 0.88, respectively. V(3) had low test/retest reproducibility, due to high variability in the measures of free parent tracer in plasma. This study supports the feasibility of equilibrium imaging of 5-HT2A receptors with PET and [18F]deuteroaltanserin. The equilibrium imaging method with [18F]deuteroaltanserin allows a single acquisition and blood measurement to provide an image whose pixel values equal a receptor volume of distribution. Since the single image pixel values are proportional to receptor densities, the images can be used in pixel-by-pixel statistical methods, such as SPM, to assess the distribution and density of 5-HT2A receptors in neuropsychiatric disorders.
