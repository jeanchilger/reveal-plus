Detection of extrathoracic metastases by positron emission tomography in lung cancer. Accurate staging of non-small cell lung cancer is essential for treatment planning. We evaluated in a prospective study the role of whole-body 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in mediastinal nodal staging with a positive predictive value of 96%. The study was continued to further evaluate the value of whole-body FDG PET in detecting unexpected extrathoracic metastases (ETMs) in patients qualifying for surgical treatment by conventional staging.One hundred patients underwent clinical evaluation, chest and upper abdominal computed tomography scan, mediastinoscopy (lymph nodes greater than 1 cm on computed tomography), and routine laboratory tests. In 94 patients with stage IIIa or less and 6 with suspected N3 a whole-body FDG PET was performed. If clinical signs of ETMs were present additional diagnostic methods were applied. All findings in the FDG PET were confirmed histologically or radiologically.Unexpected ETMs were detected in 13 (14%) of 94 patients (stage IIIa or less) at 14 sites. In addition 6 of 94 patients were restaged up to N3 after PET. The suspected N3 disease (stage IIIb) on computed tomography was confirmed by PET in all 6 patients. There was no false positive finding of ETM. Weight loss was correlated with the occurrence of ETM: more than 5 kg, 5 of 13 patients (38%) more than 10 kg, 4 of 6 patients (67%). Pathologic laboratory findings were not predictive for ETM.Whole-body FDG PET improves detection of ETMs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer otherwise elegible for operation. In 14% of patients (stage IIIa or less), ETMs were detected, and in total, 20% of the patients were understaged.
