Detection of recurrence by 18F-FDG PET in patients with endometrial cancer showing no evidence of disease. This study assessed the feasibility of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) in the post-therapy surveillance for patients with endometrial cancer showing no evidence of disease (NED). From April 1997 to June 2007, 127 patients with endometrial cancer showing NED were performed (18)F-FDG PET scan. The feasibility of (18)F-FDG PET for the early detection of recurrence in patients with endometrial cancer was evaluated retrospectively. Of the 127 patients, 32 patients showed positive lesions on (18)F-FDG PET scan. Nineteen (19/127 cases, 15%) of them were confirmed to have a recurrence clinically or histologically. The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value of (18)F-FDG PET for detecting recurrences in patients with endometrial cancer were 100%, 88%, 59% and 100%, respectively. In conclusion, (18)F-FDG PET may be a useful method for the post-therapy surveillance in patients with endometrial cancer.
