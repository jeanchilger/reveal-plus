Imaging of metastatic disease to the thorax. Tumor imaging is at the forefront of radiology technology and is the focus of most cutting edge research. Radiologic applications for imaging of metastases are applied to initial staging, restaging after neoadjuvant therapy, and follow-up surveillance after therapy for tumor recurrence. CT is the routine imaging choice in staging, restaging, and detection of recurrence. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography has evolved as an imaging modality that further improves staging as well as the detection of recurrent and metastatic disease.
