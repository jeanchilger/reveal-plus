Imaging the efficacy of anti-inflammatory liposomes in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis by non-invasive imaging. Nanomedicine can provide a potent alternative to current therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis. For example, the encapsulation of anti-inflammatory drugs into liposomes improves their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, thereby enhancing bioavailability to atherosclerotic plaques and improving therapeutic efficacy. The evaluation of this type of experimental therapeutics can greatly benefit from in vivo evaluation to assess biological changes, which can be performed by non-invasive imaging techniques, such as ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Here, we will illustrate the methods for inducing atherosclerosis in a rabbit model, the production of anti-inflammatory liposomes and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy of experimental therapeutics with the above-mentioned imaging techniques.
