99mTc]demotensin VI: biodistribution and initial clinical results in tumor patients of a pilot/phase I stud. Neurotensin subtype 1 receptor overexpression is found in a variety of human tumors. The aim of this pilot/phase I study was to assess the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and imaging characteristics of (99m)Tc-Demotensin VI in tumor patients.Scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-Demotensin VI was performed in 14 patients (2 female and 12 male) with advanced tumor stages. The diagnoses were pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=4), small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (n=4), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n=4), and colon carcinoma (n=2). Patients were injected with 500-550 MBq (99m)Tc-Demotensin VI. Blood samples were taken at various time points and urine was also collected up to 24 hours post-injection (p.i.) Planar images were acquired at 15-30 minutes, 1-2 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours p.i. with additional SPECT imaging at 4 hours.Radiochemical purity always exceeded 95% up to 4 hours. Urinary and blood excretion was rapid with 5.05% ID (mean: n=5) in plasma after 4 hours. No side effects were observed after injection of (99m)Tc-Demotensin VI. Focal tracer accumulation was observed in 3 patients with brain metastases due to NSCLC, although specificity of this uptake could not be proven. Further, no tumor-related findings were observed. Although stability tests in human plasma revealed that (99m)Tc-Demotensin VI remained intact up to 2 hours incubation, ex vivo urine analysis indicated rapid metabolism.(99m)Tc-Demotensin VI was well tolerated by patients and showed favorable pharmacokinetics however, tumor targeting was limited to brain metastases. Further studies on stability issues and receptor characterization in tumors are warranted to introduce neurotensin receptors (NTSR) imaging into the clinic.
