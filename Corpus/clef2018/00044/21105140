Recent technological and application developments in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for improved pulmonary nodule detection and lung cancer staging. This review compares the emerging technologies and approaches in the application of magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) imaging for the assessment of pulmonary nodules and staging of malignant findings. Included in this review is a brief definition of pulmonary nodules and an introduction to the challenges faced. We have highlighted the current status of both MR and CT for the early detection of lung nodules. Developments are detailed in this review for the management of pulmonary nodules using advanced imaging, including: dynamic imaging studies, dual energy CT, computer aided detection and diagnosis, and imaging assisted nodule biopsy approaches which have improved lung nodule detection and diagnosis rates. Recent advancements linking in vivo imaging to corresponding histological pathology are also highlighted. In vivo imaging plays a pivotal role in the clinical staging of pulmonary nodules through TNM assessment. While CT and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT are currently the most commonly clinically employed modalities for pulmonary nodule staging, studies are presented that highlight the augmentative potential of MR.
