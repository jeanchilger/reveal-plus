Chart-algorithm of early etiological diagnosis of acute pneumonia. A proposed method of scheme-algorithm is aimed at facilitation of an early etiological diagnosis of acute pneumonia (AP) by initial clinical signs. A blind trial with 78 AP verified cases showed that the scheme can establish a correct etiological diagnosis basing on AP early clinical symptoms alone in 75% of cases. The sensitivity of the method is 75%, specificity 91%.
