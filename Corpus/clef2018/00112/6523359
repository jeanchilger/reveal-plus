Viral-microbial associations and the function of humoral factors of natural immunity in acute pneumonia patients. A total of 359 patients with acute pneumonia and 152 practically healthy subjects comprising the control group were examined. Immunofluorescence was used to investigate nasopharyngeal washings for detecting antigens of influenza and parainfluenza viruses, respiratory-syncytial virus, adenoviruses, whereas serological studies according to the hemagglutination delay test with diagnostic agents for detecting influenza A1, A2, B, types 1, 2 and 3 parainfluenza, and the complement fixation test were made to detect antibodies against adenoviruses. Serological (65%) and immunofluorescence (63%) studies revealed associations of different viruses: type 3 and 1 parainfluenza, respiratory-syncytial virus (73%) with adenoviruses, influenza B, A2, type 2 parainfluenza. Association of different bacteria was observed in 67% of patients: hemolytic staphylococcus (65%), hemolytic streptococcus (50%), pneumococci (45%), P. aeruginosa (40%), P. mirabilis (35%), E. coli (30%), enterococci (25%). Associations of 3-2 causative agents were predominant (53%). Marked decrease in the content of complement and beta-lysins, elevation of the level of lysozyme were observed in patients with viral-bacterial and viral pneumonias as compared to the same characteristics in patients with bacterial pneumonia and in control group subjects.
