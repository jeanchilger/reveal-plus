Humoral antiviral immunity in children with hematologic neoplasms. Antiviral humoral immunity was studied in patients with Hodgkin's disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and aplastic anemia (AA). Insufficiency of antiviral humoral immunity as regards antigenically unrelated viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was characteristic of all these conditions. A remission of Hodgkin's disease and ITP was associated with a reliable increase of the studied parameters in comparison with the acute period of the disease. After splenectomy humoral immunity parameters were virtually unchanged in patients with ITP, whereas in patients with Hodgkin's disease and AA the deficiency of antibody production is 40% increased after the operation.
