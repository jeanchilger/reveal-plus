Low prevalence of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae among patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infections in Dutch general practices. Acute respiratory disease is one of the most common reasons to consult a general practitioner. A substantial part of these diseases cannot be explained by an infection with a virus or a common pathogenic bacterium. To study this diagnostic deficit, the prevalence of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections was determined in two groups of patients consulting a general practitioner. DNA of C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae was detected by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nose/throat swabs from six (1.1%), and from seven (1.3%) patients, respectively, of 557 patients consulting a general practitioner for complaints suggestive for a virus infection during the 1994/1995 respiratory infections season. Two patients remained C. pneumoniae PCR-positive for at least 4 weeks. All others were negative within 3 weeks. Double infections of C. pneumoniae and influenza virus (3/6), and of M. pneumoniae and respiratory syncytial virus (1/7) or rhinovirus (1/7) were diagnosed. During the 1992/1993 season, attempts to isolate C. pneumoniae in cell culture or to detect C. pneumoniae DNA by PCR using throat swabs were all negative for 80 patients with a sore throat, although serological data suggested a C. pneumoniae infection in 13 (16%) patients. A specimen from another patient of this group was M. pneumoniae PCR-positive and the corresponding serum specimens showed a persistent high antibody titre. In summary, the prevalence of acute C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae infections was less than 2% in patients consulting a general practitioner.
