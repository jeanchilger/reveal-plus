The usefulness of open-lung biopsy in the pediatric bone marrow transplant population. From October 1976 to October 1986, 126 children had bone marrow transplants at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The indications were acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (30), nonlymphocytic leukemia (24), aplastic anemia (15), solid tumors (47), and miscellaneous conditions (10). Of these, 21 (17%) underwent 22 open-lung biopsies. Fourteen of these patients showed no causative microorganism. When a cause was found it was viral (usually cytomegalovirus [CMV]) in three, fungal in one, Pneumocystis carinii alone in two, both viral and pneumocystis in one, and a combination of viral, bacterial, and pneumocystis in one. Thirteen patients died due to continued deterioration after the biopsy. In only two patients was there a significant change in antimicrobial therapy as a result of the biopsy. Both had Pneumocystis (one in combination with virus and bacteria). One patient with chronic infiltrates showed a lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, which responded well to steroids. Open-lung biopsy is currently of limited value in this patient population. Survival is dismal unless the patient has Pneumocystis. We believe that prospective studies should be set up to compare open-lung biopsy with empiric antimicrobial therapy. A major emphasis must be on prevention.
