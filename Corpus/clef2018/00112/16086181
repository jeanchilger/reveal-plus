Value of axial and coronal maximum intensity projection (MIP) images in the detection of pulmonary nodules by multislice spiral CT: comparison with axial 1-mm and 5-mm slices. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of non-overlapping 10-mm axial and coronal maximum intensity projections (MIP) in comparison with standard axial 1-mm and 5-mm slices in the detection of pulmonary nodules. Sixty patients with suspected nodules who underwent multislice spiral CT of the chest were evaluated. Axial 1-mm and 5-mm slices as well as non-overlapping 10-mm axial/coronal MIPs were interpreted independently by three blinded radiologists. After initial review, a retrospective consensus session was performed for agreement on final nodule counts using the axial 1-mm slices as gold standard. Small nodules of less than 5 mm in size were most accurately detected by the axial MIPs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of these small nodules showed that 5-mm slices were not capable of a statistically significant differentiation of nodules from other focal lesions in two observers (p=0.034 and p=0.012, respectively) whereas 1-mm slices and coronal/axial MIPs did allow a statistically significant differentiation in all observers (p<0.001). Nodules larger than 5 mm were equally well depicted with all modalities. Non-overlapping 10-mm axial MIPs improve the accuracy in the detection of small pulmonary nodules.
