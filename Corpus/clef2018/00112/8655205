A randomized study of imipenem compared to cefotaxime plus piperacillin as initial therapy of infections in granulocytopenic patients. The objective of the presented, randomized study was to compare the efficacy of antimicrobial monotherapy with imipenem (3 x 0.5g/d) to a combination therapy with cefotaxime (3 x 2g/d) plus piperacillin (3 x 4g/d) for empirical treatment of infections in neutropenic patients. In 165 patients, 237 infectious episodes were evaluable. The overall response rate of patients treated with cefotaxime plus piperacillin was 67/115 (58%), of those treated with imipenem 66/122 (54%). In patients not responding to the initial therapy regimen within 2 or 3 days, the antimicrobial therapy was modified. After therapy modification 85/100 patients were cured. Fever of unknown origin (FUO) showed the most favourable course compared to other infection types, with a response in 46/59 (78%) and in 35/50 (70%) cases, respectively. In comparison, pneumonias were successfully treated in only 3/21 (14%) and 7/37 (19%) cases. Even including patients with modified therapy, only 66% (21/32) of pneumonia episodes responded. The unfavourable results in pneumonias is mainly due to the high rate of 13 systemic mycoses in this group (22%). Overall, a similar response was observed in patients treated with cefotaxime plus piperacillin in comparison with imipenem. In primary bacteremias however, an advantage was observed in patients treated with imipenem (20/27 74%) compared with cefotaxime plus piperacillin (11/23
