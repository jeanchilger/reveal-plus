Neurologic manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections: diverse spectrum of diseases. A report of six cases and review of the literature. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections of varying severity. It is also responsible for producing a wide spectrum of nonpulmonary manifestations including neurologic, hepatic, cardiac, and hematologic diseases. The neurologic manifestations are reported to be the most common nonpulmonary manifestations. We describe six patients demonstrating the protean neurologic manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. Four patients presented with the central nervous system manifestations of pyramidal and extrapyramidal tract dysfunction, seizures, cognitive abnormalities, and cerebellar dysfunction. Two patients presented with transverse myelitis. The outcome of this condition ranges from normal to severe residual deficits. Increased awareness of this disease entity may facilitate early diagnosis and thereby expedite starting appropriate therapy that may modify the outcome.
