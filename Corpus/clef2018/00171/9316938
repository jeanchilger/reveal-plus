PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and sequencing as an alternative to serology for M-antigen typing of Streptococcus pyogenes. A rapid PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for identification of 10 important emm gene types of Streptococcus pyogenes was developed. The emm genotypes of a coded panel of strains of known M serotype were determined, and in 144 of 149 cases (97%) the results were congruous. Strains of types that were not included in the panel of capture probes were emm genotyped by sequencing.
