Distribution of emm types among group A streptococcal isolates from Serbia. This is the first study concerning the molecular epidemiology of group A streptococcus in Serbia and includes 145 isolates from patients with various infections during the period 2001-2007. The emm types, superantigen profile and susceptibility pattern were determined. Among 31 emm types identified, the most prevalent were emm 6, emm 12, emm 1, and emm 58. All isolates showed uniform antimicrobial susceptibility to all tested antibiotics, with the exception of tetracycline and erythromycin (41% and 0.7% resistant strains, respectively). Significant heterogeneity of emm types was found, with a high frequency of emm 6 and emm 58, as well as a considerable prevalence of tetracycline resistance, and a low level of macrolide resistance.
