Antibody-mediated neuronal cell signaling in behavior and movement disorders. Behavioral and movement disorders may have antibody responses where mimicry and signal transduction may lead to neuropsychiatric abnormalities. In our study, antibodies in pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococci (PANDAS) reacted with the neuronal cell surface and caudate-putamen and induced calcium-calmodulin dependent protein (CaM) kinase II activity in neuronal cells. Depletion of serum IgG abrogated CaM kinase II cell signaling and reactivity of CSF was blocked by streptococcal antigen N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Antibodies against GlcNAc in PANDAS sera were inhibited by lysoganglioside G(M1). Results suggest that antibodies from an infection may signal neuronal cells in some behavioral and movement disorders.
