Childhood pneumococcal bacteraemia in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Forty-nine children with pneumococcal bacteraemia seen during a 5-year period (1 January 1991 to 31 December 1995) at King Khalid University Hospital were studied. The majority (61.2%) were under 2 years of age. The focus of infection was pneumonia, pharyngitis or undetermined in 28.6%, 18.4% and 20.4%, respectively. Diseases that had probably predisposed them to pneumococcal bacteraemia (mainly nephrotic syndrome) were encountered in 24.5% of cases. Forty-five per cent of the cases occurred during the summer season and in 29% the disease was nosocomially acquired. No death was recorded in this series and the reasons for this are discussed. Detection of pneumococcal antigens from blood taken for culture was successful in 96% of cases this test is important in the diagnosis of pneumococcal bacteraemia in partially treated patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed 20.4% of the isolates to be relatively penicillin-resistant. Resistance to other antimicrobial agents was also recorded and multiple resistance was noted in 22% of isolates. There was a significant difference between the ceftriaxone MIC of the relatively penicillin-resistant strains compared with penicillin-sensitive strains. The emergence and the steady increase in the numbers of relatively penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strains in Saudi Arabia during the last 10 years are discussed.
