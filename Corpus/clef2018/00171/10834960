High rate of tetracycline resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes in Iran: an epidemiological study. Streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen, is still considered susceptible to beta-lactams, but for other relevant antibiotics, highly variable resistance rates have been reported. Since no data were available from Iran, we tested 1,335 throat isolates from two different regions of the country for their antibiotic susceptibilities and, for comparison, a collection of 80 strains isolated from 1989 to 1991. Erythromycin resistance was uncommon (0.6%), whereas an overall high rate of tetracycline resistance was found, increasing between 1989-1991 and 1995-1997 from 23 to 42%. The tetracycline-resistant strains belonged to more than 10 different T types, the majority being types 4, 11, and B3264. By conventional M typing of 406 tetracycline-resistant isolates, more than 20 different M types were found. Approximately 50% of the strains were nontypeable by T agglutination as well as serological M typing however, by genotyping by a combined PCR-capture-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, many of these strains were successfully emm typed. We conclude that the high rate of tetracycline resistance among Iranian S. pyogenes isolates is due to multiclonal dissemination of resistance within the streptococcal population rather than epidemic spread of single clones.
