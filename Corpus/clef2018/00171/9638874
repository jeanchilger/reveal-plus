Cloning and sequencing of BeS-1 gene encoding the immunogenic antigen of Streptococcus sanguis KTH-1 isolated from the patients with Behçet's disease. In order to analyze the immunopathologic mechanisms of Behçet's disease, the gene (bes-1) encoding a streptococcal antigen correlated with the disease was cloned and sequenced, and protein produced by this clone was identified by Western immunoblotting using serum antibody from the patient. Cellular DNA of Streptococcus (S.) sanguis serotype KTH-1 (uncommon serotype 1, strain 113-20) from the patient was extracted and digested with EcoRI. The digested fragments were cloned into the cloning vector lambda gt11, and then the resulting DNA library was immunoscreened using the patient's serum antibody to serotype KTH-1. The immunopositive clone of the 1.5 kbp fragment was subcloned into pUC 118 plasmid (pU8BeS1-1) and sequenced. The sequence showed that the 3'-terminal half side region of this insert contained 962bp of open-reading frame (ORF) discontinued at the EcoRI restriction site, and the stop codon was not found. The nucleotide sequence of the remaining additional 3'-terminal region of this gene encoding whole BES-1 was determined by genome walking. The whole ORF of bes-1 consisted of 849 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 95 kDa. The residues in a portion of the amino acid sequence showed a 60% correspondence to those of the human intraocular peptide Brn-3b.
