Indicators of streptococcal infection and HLA antigens in patients with rheumatism. A study of histocompatibility antigens in 165 patients with rheumatic fever showed that the most commonly high titers of ASL-O, ASH, ADNAse B were found in the carriers of HLA, A11, B27, CW1, CW2, CW3, DR5 and DR7 antigens which, according to our data, were associated with rheumatic fever. High titers of streptococcal antibodies were found in persons with HLA-A1 and B27.
