Human beta-Defensins in different states of diseases of the tonsilla palatina. Tonsils are believed to play an important role during the development of the immune system. Although diseases of the tonsils like hypertrophy of the tonsil, acute tonsillitis, chronic tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess are common, little is known about the underlying pathophysiology. Little is known about antimicrobial peptides produced by the tonsils. The human beta-Defensins 1-3 (hBD1-3) are naturally produced "antibiotics" with antimicrobial activity against different bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The objective of the study was to determine the concentrations for hBD1-3 in different states of diseases of the tonsilla palatina. After tonsillectomy and tissue fixation in formalin, total proteins were isolated from 38 samples (11 hypertrophy of the tonsil, 8 acute tonsillitis, 11 chronic tonsillitis, 8 peritonsillar abscesses). The protein concentration was determined and ELISA for hBD1-3 were performed. We also conducted immunofluorescence double stainings for the co-expression of streptococcus group A and hBD1-3. We could verify a significant difference for the mean hBD1 score of the acute tonsillitis in comparison to the hyperplastic tonsil, the chronic tonsillitis, and the peritonsillar abscess. There was no statistically significant difference in the hBD2 and hBD3 concentrations between the four groups. The immunofluorescence stainings showed that hBD1-3 and the streptococcus group A in the same place. We conclude that in the hyperplastic tonsilla palatina hBD1-3 play an important role. The mouth is constantly faced with a high bacterial load. During a tonsillitis, the hBD1 concentration is lower than in the non-acute infected tonsil because hBD1 is being consumed for fighting the bacterial infection. But, the existence of hBD1-3 in the tonsil cannot prevent the tonsillitis to become chronic.
