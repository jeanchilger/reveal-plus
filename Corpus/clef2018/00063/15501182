New developments in imaging for diagnosis and therapy monitoring in rheumatic diseases. The availability of therapeutic modalities that are able to stop inflammatory joint damage has also markedly influenced recent developments in muskuloskeletal imaging. One focus of interest is the detection of joint pathology as early as possible in order to prevent erosive bony changes. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are the most valuable technologies in this respect. Another focus is on the exact assessment and documentation of joint damage using scoring systems not only in therapeutic trials, but also in clinical practice. In addition to these recent advances in peripheral and axial joint imaging, this chapter also discusses advances in vascular imaging and scintigraphy in rheumatoid diseases as well as interventional procedures guided by imaging technologies.
