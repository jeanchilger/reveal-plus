Surgical treatment of well differentiated neuroendocrine tumours of the lung. The bronchial tree represents the most frequent site of origin of carcinoids (around 25% of the total). The spectrum of differentiation of lung neuroendocrine tumors ranges from low-malignancy (carcinoids) to highly aggressive forms (small cell lung carcinoma) Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies therefore vary greatly. In well differentiated tumors (carcinoids) signs and symptoms are related to the airways obstruction in central forms, while peripheral forms are mostly discovered accidentally if asymptomatic. Clinical or subclinical paraneoplastic syndromes are associated in a minority of cases. Diagnostic work-up includes CT multislice, bronchial endoscopy and Octreoscan with chest Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Further contribute may be added by the (68), Ga-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-ocreotide (DOTATOC) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) PET-CT, at present available only in a few centres, and by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), fluorescence bronchoscopy and virtual bronchoscopy. Surgery is the treatment of choice, while medical therapy is useful to treat the hypersecretion in paraneoplastic syndromes and to control tumor proliferation in metastatic or/and inoperable disease.
