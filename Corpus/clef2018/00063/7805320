Bilateral cerebral mediofrontal hypoactivity in Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT imaging. Fifteen patients who had bilateral mediofrontal hypoactivity and 30 control subjects without this SPECT anomaly underwent Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT imaging. Bilateral mediofrontal hypoactivity was found in various neurologic disorders, including subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy, lacunar state, chronic alcoholism, progressive nonvascular dementia, carbon monoxide poisoning, and diabetes mellitus. This SPECT abnormality was, however, specifically associated with three clinical signs: motor disabilities predominating in the lower limbs, urinary incontinence, and akinetic mutism.
