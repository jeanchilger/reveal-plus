The use of PET/CT in the diagnostics of lung cancer. More than 6000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed annually in the Czech Republic. While incidence in men remains stagnant in recent years, incidence in women steadily grows. Combined imaging modality positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) becomes the imaging method of choice for an increasing number of oncology indications, including lung cancer. With this integrated PET/CT device, accurately registered anatomic and functional images can be acquired in a single examination. Having such aligned image sets available has been shown to increase the accuracy of the interpretation of pulmonary nodules and pulmonary masses.
