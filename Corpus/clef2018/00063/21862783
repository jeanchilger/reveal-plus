Imaging-guided preoperative hookwire localization of nonpalpable extramammary lesions. Imaging-guided hookwire localization of nonpalpable lesions in the breast is frequently performed preoperatively. Outside the breast, this procedure is useful for planning resection of lesions in anatomic regions without intrinsic landmarks. The purpose of this study was to review an experience with hookwire localization of nonpalpable extramammary lesions.Preoperative imaging-guided hookwire localization is a useful technique that allows precise exploration and resection of nonpalpable lesions and increases confidence that the lesions have been entirely resected.
