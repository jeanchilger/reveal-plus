Significance of rest technetium-99m sestamibi imaging for the prediction of improvement of left ventricular dysfunction after Q wave myocardial infarction: importance of infarct location adjusted thresholds. The value of rest technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi scintigraphy under oral nitrate medication to predict myocardial viability was examined in patients with chronic infarcts.The value of rest Tc-99m sestamibi to predict viability in infarct regions has not been fully established because significant underestimation of viability, especially in the inferior myocardial wall, has been reported.Forty patients with Q wave myocardial infarction underwent Tc-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography under nitrate medication before revascularization of the infarct-related artery. Wall motion was quantified from paired angiograms before and 4 months after revascularization. Tracer uptake was quantified in the central infarct region identified on the angiogram.The average Tc-99m sestamibi uptake in the central infarct region of patients with anterior infarcts and improvement of left ventricular function was significantly higher (68+/-12%, mean+/-SD) than in patients without improvement of function (40+/-14%, p < 0.02). The average Tc-99m sestamibi uptake in the central infarct region of patients with improvement of function and inferior infarcts was significantly lower (43+/-7%) than in patients with anterior infarcts (68+/-12%, p < 0.003), but was significantly higher than in patients with inferior infarction and no improvement of function (31+/-7%, p < 0.02). Using an infarct location adjusted optimal threshold (50% for anterior infarcts, 35% for inferior infarcts), Tc-99m sestamibi had a positive predictive value of 90% and a negative predictive value of 91% for improvement of left ventricular function.Quantitative rest Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy after oral nitrates reliably predicts improvement of left ventricular function after revascularization if infarct location adjusted thresholds are used.
