Diagnosis of lung cancer using two-phase Tl-201 SPECT and modified retention image to view tumor in the collapsed lung: comparison with bolus CT. In this report the usefulness of Tl-201 SPECT and modified retention images in the differentiation of lung cancer and postobstructive collapse was studied. Two-phase Tl-201 SPECT was performed in 20 lung cancer lesions in which postobstructive collapse was suspected on CT. Retention imaging was done afterward. Three types of Tl-201 images were compared with the bolus CT images. Bolus CT differentiated lung cancer from postobstructive collapse in 7 of the 20 lesions (35%). Tl-201 SPECT differentiated the two conditions in 9 of 20 lesions (45%) on early Tl-201 SPECT and in 13 of 20 lesions (65%) on delayed imaging. With modified retention images, differentiation was possible in 13 of 20 lesions (65%). By combining delayed Tl-201 SPECT and modified retention images, lung cancer alone could be demonstrated in 18 of 20 lesions (90%). Combined delayed Tl-201 SPECT and modified retention images were more effective than bolus CT in delineating the extent of lung cancer in the presence of postobstructive collapse.
