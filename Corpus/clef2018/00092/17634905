Solitary pulmonary nodule. Assessment and therapy. Solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) are radiologically defined as intraparenchymal lung lesions not bigger then 3 cm. In general all pulmonary nodules should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. Primary peripheral lung cancer is the most common cause, at 40%. The probability that an SPN is malignant increases with patient age. Spiral chest CT is the ideal imaging to indicate the precise anatomical location and expose other pathological findings. Malignant SPN can also persist without change for over 2 years. Only complete histological examination can exclude malignance. Therefore every SPN should be resected in operable patients. The surgical risk of video-assisted pulmonary resection and diagnostic thoracotomy is low. For patients who are not operable, other diagnostic procedures such as transthoracic needle aspiration or positron emission tomography may be helpful.
