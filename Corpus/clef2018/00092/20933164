What is the role of FDG-PET in thoracic oncology in 2010?. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography (FGD-PET) has been considered to have a major impact on the management of lung malignancies since the beginning of this century. Its value has been demonstrated by many publications, meta-analysis and European/American/Japanese recommendations. PET combined with computed tomography has provided useful information regarding the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer and allows for the delivery of adaptive radiotherapy. In its more common uses, PET has been shown to be cost-effective. With the widespread use of new radiotracers, PET will play an increasing role in the evaluation of response to treatment.
