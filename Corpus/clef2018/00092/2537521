SPECT-3-D reconstructions of lung perfusion in patients with thoracic space-occupying lesions. The present study deals with 3-dimensional reconstruction of lung perfusion examinations in 20 patients with thoracic masses. The images were obtained by single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and were compared with conventional scintigraphic images and with the CT findings. 3-D reconstructions proved superior to 2-dimensional images for the topographic demonstration of the affected lung segments. No additional information could be obtained concerning the extent of the mass. Use of this method is valuable for the preoperative estimation of pulmonary perfusion.
