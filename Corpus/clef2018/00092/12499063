Bronchoscopy and surgical staging procedures and their correlation with imaging. Bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT) and surgical staging procedures are complimentary methods of investigating patients with lung cancer. CT has been shown to be of value prior to bronchoscopy in the investigation of haemoptysis and malignancy, with excellent correlation between the detection of disease within the large airways on CT and direct visualisation at bronchoscopy. The utility of CT has been further increased by the development of multislice scanners with the generation of volumetric data enabling multiplanar image acquisition. Additionally the advent of CT co-registered with positron emission tomography will play an important role in guiding the choice of surgical staging procedures The increasing use of multidisciplinary medical care requires radiologists to have a greater understanding of the abilities and limitations of both bronchoscopy and surgical staging procedures in evaluating disease demonstrated on imaging.
