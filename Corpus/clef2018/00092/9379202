Performance evaluation of a whole-body PET scanner using the NEMA protocol. National Electrical Manufacturers Association. This study evaluates the performance of the newly developed high-resolution whole-body PET scanner ECAT EXACT HR+.The scanner consists of four rings of 72 bismuth germanate block detectors each, covering an axial field of view of 15.5 cm with a patient port of 56.2 cm. A single block detector is divided into an 8 x 8 matrix, giving a total of 32 rings with 576 detectors each. The dimensions of a single detector element are 4.39 x 4.05 x 30 mm3. The scanner is equipped with extendable tungsten septa for two-dimensional two-dimensional measurements, as well as with three 68Ge line sources for transmission scans and daily quality control. The spatial resolution, scatter fraction, count rate, sensitivity, uniformity and accuracy of the implemented correction algorithms were evaluated after the National Electrical Manufacturers Association protocol using the standard acquisition parameters.The transaxial resolution in the two-dimensional mode is 4.3 mm (4.4 mm) in the center and increases to 4.7 mm (4.8 mm) tangential and to 8.3 mm (8.0 mm) radial at a distance of r = 20 cm from the center. The axial slice width measured in the two-dimensional mode varies between 4.2 and 6.6 mm FWHM over the transaxial field of view. In the three-dimensional mode the average axial resolution varies between 4.1 mm FWHM in the center and 7.8 mm at r = 20 cm. The scatter fraction is 17.1% (32.5%) for a lower energy discriminator level of 350 keV. The maximum true event count rate of 263 (345) kcps was measured at an activity concentration of 142 (26.9) kBq/ml. The total system sensitivity for true events is 5.7 (27.7) cps/Bq/ml. From the uniformity measurements, we obtained a volume variance of 3.9% (5.0%) and a system variance of 1.6% (1.7%). The implemented three-dimensional scatter correction algorithm reveals very favorable properties, whereas the three-dimensional attenuation correction yields slightly inaccurate results in low- and high-density regions.The ECAT EXACT HR+ has an excellent, nearly isotropic spatial resolution, which is advantageous for brain and small animal studies. While the relatively low slice sensitivity may hamper the capability for performing fast dynamic two-dimensional studies, the scanner offers a sufficient sensitivity and count rate capacity for fully three-dimensional whole-body imaging.
