Imaging appearances following thermal ablation. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has an increasingly important role in the management of a number of solid tumours. Treatments usually take place at specialist centres that draw patients from a wide geographical area, but follow-up imaging is often undertaken at the referring institution. This review aims to describe and illustrate the range of normal and abnormal post-ablative appearances encountered in the most commonly treated organs, i.e. liver, lung, and kidney, to equip radiologists with the necessary knowledge for confident interpretation of post-ablation imaging in this diverse patient group.
