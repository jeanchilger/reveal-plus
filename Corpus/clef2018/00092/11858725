Expression of ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) Pit-1 in Escherichia coli: its purification and immunohistochemical detection using monoclonal antibody. The pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 belongs to the family of POU-domain proteins and is known to play an important role in the differentiation of pituitary cells. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding Pit-1 from the brackish water fish, ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis). Nucleotide sequence analysis of 1910 bp of ayu Pit-1 cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 1074 bp that encodes a protein of 358 amino acids containing a POU-specific domain, POU homeodomain, and an STA (Ser/Thr-rich activation) transactivation domain. We inserted the coding region of Pit-1 cDNA, obtained by PCR, into a pET-20b(+) plasmid to produce recombinant Pit-1 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Upon induction with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, Pit-1 was expressed and accumulated as inclusion bodies in E. coli. The protein was then purified in one step by affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column under denaturing conditions. This method yielded 0.7 mg of highly pure and stable protein per 200 ml of bacterial culture. A band of 40 kDa, resolved as recombinant ayu Pit-1 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, agrees well with the molecular mass calculated from the translated cDNA sequence. The purified recombinant Pit-1 was confirmed in vitro through Western blot analysis, using its monoclonal antibody. This monoclonal antibody detected Pit-1 in the nuclei of ayu developing pituitary by immunohistochemical reaction. It serves as a good reagent for the detection of ayu Pit-1 in situ.
