Tumor diagnosis by PET: potential of seven tracers examined in five experimental tumors including an artificial metastasis model. The potential of seven tracers for the metabolic imaging of tumors by positron emission tomography was studied using five experimental tumor models. The tracers examined were 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-galactose (2-[18F]FdGal) and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-L-fucose (2-[18F]FdFuc) for investigating energy metabolism. L-[methyl-11C]Methionine ([11C]Met) and 6-[18F]fluoro-L-fucose (6-[18F]FFuc) were used for assessing protein and glycoprotein synthesis, while [3H]thymidine ([3H]Thd) and 2-deoxy-5'-[18F]fluorouridine ([18F]FdUrd) were used to investigate nucleic acid metabolism. The highest mean uptake by the five different tumors was found for [3H]Thd, followed in order by [18F]FDG, [11C]Met, 2-[18F]FdGal, [18F]FdUrd, 2-[18F]FdFuc and 6-[18F]FFuc. The tumor-to-tissue uptake ratios indicated that the nucleosides, [11C]Met and 6-[18F]FFuc were better tracers in the brain region. All the tracers except for the fucose analogs were suitable for the thoracic region, while [11C]Thd and [18F]FDG were superior in the abdominal region. In comparison with the primary tumor model of Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL), [3H]Thd uptake in the artificial metastatic 3LL model showed the maximum enhancement, followed by [18F]FDG, [11C]Met and the other tracers. The [18F]FDG uptake correlated with the [3H]Thd uptake. [18F]FdUrd, 6-[18F]FFuc and 2-[18F]FdGal could be used for distinguishing different types of tumors. The combined use of these radiotracers can possibly allow the assessment of tumor metabolism, and this indicates the viability of tumors.
