Diastolic myocardial dysfunction does not affect survival in patients with cirrhosis. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (DDF) has been considered as a component of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. The clinical significance of DDF in cirrhotics has not been clarified. We prospectively evaluated the echocardiographic-Doppler, tissue-Doppler (TDI) findings of left ventricular function and survival in cirrhotics with or without DDF. Seventy-six cirrhotics without endogenous heart disease were included. DDF was diagnosed by mitral inflow Doppler parameters and diastolic myocardial velocities. Assessments of demographics, liver dysfunction, laboratory, echocardiographic systolic/diastolic indices, TDI of mitral annular motion and M-mode echocardiography were recorded. Patients were followed-up for a median of 25 months (15-40). DDF was diagnosed in 51 (67%) patients. Patients with compared with those without DDF had significantly older age and higher pulse rate as well as more frequently severe ascites, greater aortic root diameter and interventricular septal thickness. There was no difference in systolic myocardial function between two groups. Patients with DDF had a trend for worse survival (long rank, P = 0.094). A multivariate analysis showed that age, MELD and sodium but no DDF were predictive of death. DDF is prevalent in advanced cirrhosis and is associated with severe ascites. Systolic myocardial function and mortality do not seem to be strongly affected by the presence of DDF.
