Giant right atrial thrombus in hepatocellular carcinoma: real-time characterization by cardiac magnetic resonance and real time three-dimensional echocardiography. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extension to the right atrium is an uncommon form of cardiac involvement. We report a case of a 67-year-old man admitted to our Department for the incidental findings of a mass in the right atrium. Physical examination revealed leg edema, distention of external jugular vein and ascites. The anamnestic collection revealed HCC occurred on post-alcoholic liver cirrhosis 3 years earlier. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated RA containing a mass, with superficial apposition of a thrombotic material. Bi-dimensional echocardiography is the most commonly used noninvasive tool for evaluating intracardiac masses. Although MRI is considered the gold standard, real-time three-dimensional echocardiography has the capability to obtain the entire volume reconstruction of an intracardiac mass, even with an irregular shape. Moreover, it permits an hemodynamic evaluation of the potential obstructive effects visualized from different angles and planes.<br />
