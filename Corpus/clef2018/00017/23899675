Missed opportunities for hepatocellular carcinoma screening in an HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected cohort. We examined adherence to guidelines for screening of hepatocellular carcinoma in a cohort of HIV/hepatitis C virus-coinfected patients. Thirty-six percent of patients with documented cirrhosis did not have a screening ultrasound. Patients at centers with standardized systems for screening were more likely to have had an ultrasound performed.
