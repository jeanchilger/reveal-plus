Impact of the VIO system in hepatic resection for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This study aimed to evaluate a novel surgical device combination [VIO system containing a bipolar clamp (BiClamp) and the monopolar soft-coagulation (SOFT COAG)] in hepatic resection for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).This study performed 124 hepatic resections for HCC and divided them into 2 groups: 60 patients (Conventional group) underwent liver parenchymal transection using Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) system and saline-coupled bipolar electrocautery for hemostasis the BiClamp was used with the CUSA system for liver parenchymal transection and SOFT COAG was used with saline-coupled bipolar electrocautery for hemostasis in 64 patients (VIO group).The median blood loss in the VIO group was 345 mL, which was less than that in the Conventional group (median 548 mL, P = 0.0423). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that no use of the VIO system (P = 0.0172) was an independent predictor of intraoperative blood loss, respectively. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the VIO group included a significantly lower proportion of patients with liver cirrhosis that experienced more than 500 mL of intraoperative blood loss in comparison to those in the Conventional group (P = 0.0262).The VIO system was safe for hepatic resection and its use was associated with a significant decrease in intraoperative blood loss even in cirrhotic patients.
