Non-invasive diagnosis of focal liver lesions: an individualized approach. Modern cross-sectional imaging with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often reveals small focal liver lesions, which puts pressure on the reporting radiologist to characterize these tiny lesions. On the other hand, in patients with underlying diffuse liver disease, such as cirrhosis or severe steatosis, the detection of focal liver lesions can be quite difficult. Strategies for optimal detection and characterization of focal liver lesions should be developed according to the clinical situation, the likelihood of malignant disease and the presence of underlying diffuse liver disease. The presence or absence of a clinical history of cancer determines the algorithm for further characterization: work-up with contrast-enhanced MRI, biopsy or follow-up. In patients with chronic liver disease, recent guidelines on the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) favour the use of multiphasic MRI or MDCT, which allows confident diagnoses of HCC >1 cm. For lesions <1 cm in chronic liver disease, follow-up is recommended. In patients with moderate to severe steatosis, contrast-enhanced MDCT has low diagnostic yield for the detection of liver lesions contrast-enhanced MRI is far superior. This review describes successful strategies for the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions in different clinical scenarios.
