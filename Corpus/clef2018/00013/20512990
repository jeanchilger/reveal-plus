Intrahepatic peripheral cholangiocarcinoma in cirrhosis patients may display a vascular pattern similar to hepatocellular carcinoma on contrast-enhanced ultrasound. The aim of this study was to describe the imaging features by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in cirrhosis patients. We registered the CEUS images of cirrhosis patients with histologically confirmed ICC. In all cases magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done to confirm the diagnosis and/or staging purposes. A total of 21 patients met all the criteria to be included in the study. The median nodule size was 32 mm. All nodules showed contrast enhancement at arterial phase in 10 cases it was homogeneous and in 11 cases peripheral (rim-like). All nodules displayed washout during the venous phasesCEUS should not be used as the sole imaging technique for conclusive hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis and if the MRI does not display the diagnostic vascular pattern, a confirmatory biopsy is mandatory.
