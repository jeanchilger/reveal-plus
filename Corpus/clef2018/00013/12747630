A puzzling jaundice. In an adult beta-thalassaemic patient admitted on account of the sudden onset of nausea, vomiting and biliary pain, the concomitant jaundice was considered "obstructive" on the basis of ultrasonographic evidence of cholecysto-choledocal stones. However, when the patient was re-evaluated it was found that concomitant Gilbert's disease, hepatitis C virus related cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy had a detrimental effect on clinical and laboratory findings.
