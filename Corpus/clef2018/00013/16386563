Analysis of discarded livers for transplantation. The aims were to study the causes of nonacceptance of a liver for transplantation after exploration by the donor surgical team and to compare donor characteristics of transplanted and discarded livers. All donor harvesting procedures performed by our unit from 1988 to 2004 were retrospectively studied. Donors were divided in those accepted and transplanted and those discarded by the donor surgical team. The causes of rejection were classified as hepatic and nonhepatic. Donor characteristics of accepted, transplanted livers were compared with those rejected for hepatic reasons. Seven hundred fifty four donor liver procurements were performed: 628 livers were accepted and transplanted (TL), 126 (17.5%) were discarded owing to extrahepatic (n = 16) or hepatic causes (n = 110). Extrahepatic causes were: technical (5.6%), and incidental tumors infection (7.2%). Hepatic causes were: chronic disease or cirrhosis (26.4%), ischemic or septic liver (16.8%), and steatosis (44%). Univariate analysis of donor characteristics showed a significant difference in older age, diabetes, alcohol intake, arterial hypertension, abnormal liver ultrasound (US) exam, and abnormal liver function tests in the group of discarded livers. Obesity and the finding of steatosis in US exam were the only two factors that maintained statistical significance upon multivariate analysis.
