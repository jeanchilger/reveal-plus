Screening methods for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. The value of various screening methods in the detection of early hepatocellular carcinoma was investigated in 95 patients with cirrhosis. Infusion hepatic angiography and computed tomography with angiography were performed yearly, ultrasound every 3 months, and determination of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels every 2 months. "Space-occupying lesions" suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma were found in 13 of the 95 cases (13.7%). Detection rates of "space-occupying lesions" were 77% for infusion hepatic angiography, 77% for computed tomography with angiography and 54% for ultrasonography, respectively. In 8 of the 13 cases, "space-occupying lesions" were subsequently confirmed as hepatocellular carcinoma by operative findings or clinical course. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were negative in 3 of the 8 hepatocellular carcinoma-confirmed cases, and 3 of the remaining 5 cases demonstrated levels above 400 ng per ml at the time of diagnosis. A radical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma was successfully performed in two cases. Although it was difficult to differentiate hepatocellular carcinoma from other lesions in the case of "space-occupying lesions" smaller than 2 cm in diameter, the results suggest that regularly scheduled screening may be useful to detect early hepatocellular carcinoma.
