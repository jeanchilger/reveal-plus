Polycystic ovarian syndrome incidence in young women with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Recently, numerous studies have shown significant correlation between hyperandrogenism and elevated insulin levels in many patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Insuline-Resistance (IR) results in increased circulating levels of this hormone and it is the basis of the metabolic syndrome, characterized by the presence of fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is pathologically characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides as macro or micro vesicles, in more than 5% of hepatocytes. The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of NAFLD in young women with PCOS, who were lean, overweight or obese.Particularly, the levels of glucose and insulin, the lipidic profile, and all liver function indices were evaluated the severity and degree of steatosis were established on the basis of parenchymal echogenicity and the view of intrahepatic venous circulation.Our study showed that NAFLD is a common disease in women with polycystic ovaries, especially with high BMI, but an incidence rate of 40% in lean women too was found. Because steatohepatitis is a risk factor for the developmente of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, it is therefore prudent to carry out an ultrasound evaluation of liver in all young patients suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome, regardless of their BMI and the results of serological evaluation of liver.This collateral diagnosis that accompanies the diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome seems important since this type of patients could be treated with metformin or with thiazoles to reduce insulin-resistance and steatosis as well.
