Laparoscopic approach for down-staging in hepatocellular carcinoma patients who are candidates for liver transplantation. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of laparoscopic thermoablation (LTA) and laparoscopic resection (LR) as neoadjuvant therapy before orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).From June 2005 to November 2010, 50 consecutive patients affected by HCC with liver cirrhosis were treated with LTA under ultrasound guidance or LR. Of them, 10 patients (mean age, 58.3 ± 5.59 years male:female, 8:2) underwent OLT. They were mostly Child-Pugh class A (80%).A LTA of 12 nodules was achieved in 7 patients and an LR of 3 HCC nodules in the other 3 subjects. The mean length of surgery was 163 minutes (range 60-370). The mean hospital stay was 6.1 days. Transient mild postoperative liver failure was reported in 1 case. Complete tumor necrosis was observed in 10 thermoablated nodules (83.3%) via spiral computerized tomographic scan at 1 month after treatmentLaparoscopic ultrasound can be used in potential OLTs candidates to accurately stage HCC in advanced cirrhosis with minimal morbidity. LTA and LR proved to be safe and effective techniques for HCC patients, representing a valid "bridge" to OLT.
