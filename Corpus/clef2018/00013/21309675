Recent advances in imaging hepatic fibrosis and steatosis. Liver disease is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of parenchymal disease is histopathological assessment of a percutaneous or transjugular liver biopsy. The risks and limitations of this technique are well recognized and as a result, significant effort has gone into the development of novel noninvasive methods of diagnosis and longitudinal assessment. Imaging techniques have improved significantly over the past decade and new technologies are beginning to enter clinical practice. Ultrasound, computed tomography and MRI are the main modalities currently used, but novel MRI-based techniques will have an increasing role. While there has been extensive research into the imaging of focal liver disease, the evidence base for imaging in diffuse disease has also undergone recent rapid development, particularly in the assessment of fibrosis and steatosis. Both of these abnormalities of the parenchyma can lead to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma and represent an important opportunity for detection of early liver disease. We discuss the recent advances in liver imaging techniques and their role in the diagnosis and monitoring of diffuse liver disease, with a focus on their current and potential clinical relevance and whether they may replace or augment liver biopsy. We also discuss techniques currently under development and their potential clinical applications in the future.
