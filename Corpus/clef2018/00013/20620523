The effect of recipient hepatitis C virus infection on outcomes following heart transplantation. Insufficient data exist on the clinical course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in heart transplant (HT) recipients. Our study reports the outcomes of heart transplantation in pretransplantation HCV-positive (HCV+) recipients.A retrospective analysis of the heart transplantation database at our institution was performed to identify HT recipients who were HCV+ prior to transplantation. Chart reviews yielded demographic features, liver function tests, graft function, incidence of posttransplantation acute hepatitis and transplant coronary artery disease, and patient survival data.Between 1995 and 2006, 10 HCV+ patients underwent cardiac transplantation. The recipient mean age was 47 years (range, 23-69). Seven recipients were males and 3 were females. At listing 9 patients had no cirrhosis. One patient with Child-B cirrhosis was listed for combined heart-liver transplantation. Two of 10 donors were known to be HCV carriers. Posttransplantation in-hospital survival rate was 100%. At a mean follow-up of 58 months (range, 1.6-145), 3 deaths occurred, yielding an overall survival rate of 70%. Only 1 death (10%) was linked to accelerated acute hepatitis. Transplant coronary artery disease was detected in 2 patients (20%). Echocardiograms of survivors at last follow-up revealed normal ejection fractions. In addition, there were no cases of hepatocellular carcinoma all survivors were without evidence of hepatic dysfunction.Transplanting recipients known to have HCV did not seem to affect overall posttransplantation survival or to increase the risk of liver dysfunction or graft-related complications.
