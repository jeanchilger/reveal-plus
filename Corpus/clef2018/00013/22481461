Hepatic hemodynamics and transient elastography in alcoholic foamy degeneration: report of 2 cases. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) covers a wide spectrum of pathology ranging from fatty liver disease to acute steatohepatitis to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Alcoholic foamy degeneration (AFD) is an uncommon, potentially life-threatening condition that is part of the spectrum of ALD. It is characterized by extensive microvesicular steatosis in the perivenular areas. Since the first description in 1983, few case reports have been described. Here, we report 2 cases of AFD in patients with a previous history of chronic alcohol abuse and histological diagnosis of AFD with typical clinical, biochemical and histological features. In both cases we provide data on the hepatic hemodynamic status, and in one of them we report liver elastography results, which are features that have not been described previously. In both cases there was rapid resolution of biochemical and clinical abnormalities after complete abstinence, which is the mainstay of treatment for AFD.
