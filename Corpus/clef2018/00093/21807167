Gastrointestinal tumors in children. Although tumors arising from the spleen, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract in the pediatric population are relatively uncommon, imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. Initial imaging with abdominal radiograph contributes to the evaluation for intestinal obstruction, constipation, and mass effect, and sometimes may reveal areas of calcification.
