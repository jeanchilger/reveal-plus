The impact of detecting endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerosis: Role of positron emission tomography (PET). The endothelium plays an important role in the regulation of the intracellular fluid, vascular permeability, and modulation of vascular focal tone and angiogenesis. Endothelial dysfunction is manifested by the loss of the endothelium ability to modulate physiology changes in its vascular bed, and actually it is considered a prognostic marker of coronary artery disease. The relevance of assessing endothelial dysfunction relies in that it has been observed in different pathologies like DM, dyslipidemia, hypertension, tabaquism and in immunologic diseases like antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus. PET is a non invasive method that allows the absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow during rest, stress and adrenergic stimulation, which allows to asses endothelial function. Therefore PET is a useful diagnostic technique to identify patients with endothelial dysfunction, and in the assessment of its response to administered therapy, allowing an optimal control and prevention of secondary adverse events of these diseases.
