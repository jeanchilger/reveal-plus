Neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases: use of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging to monitor and predict radiolabeled octreotide therapy response. To evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for monitoring and assessing treatment response in patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases treated using yttrium 90 ((90)Y)-labeled octreotide ((90)Y-DOTATOC).The study was approved by the local research and ethics committee and patient informed consent was obtained. Twenty patients with liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors underwent T1-weighted DCE MR imaging of the liver before and at 2 months after intravenous (90)Y-DOTATOC treatment. Regions of interest were drawn around target lesions, as well as along liver outlines for each patient. A dual-input single-compartment model was used to compute parameters including fractional distribution volume and the arterial flow fraction. Pre- and posttreatment values were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Treatment response was defined as showing a greater than 50% reduction in the nadir chromogranin A level within the 1st year after treatment. Pretreatment values of responders and nonresponders were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. A two-tailed P value of .008 or less, which accounts for multiple testing, was considered to indicate a significant difference.In responders, tumor and whole liver distribution volume significantly increased after treatment (median tumor distribution volume, 0.182 vs 0.244 median whole liver distribution volume, 0.175 vs 0.207DCE MR imaging may be used to monitor the effects of peptide receptor radiolabeled targeted therapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors liver metastases a lower pretreatment distribution volume and high arterial flow fraction was associated with a better response to treatment.
