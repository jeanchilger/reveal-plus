Raise up 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT for detecting the changes in cerebral perfusion pressure. 99mTc-HMPAO crossed the blood brain barrier instantly in proportional to cerebral blood flow. Raise up stress and supine resting 99mTc-HMPAO with brain SPECT was devised for detecting abnormal response in the changes of cerebral perfusion pressure. Asymmetric ratio in the middle cerebral artery area in patients with internal carotid artery occlusion (n = 5) was changed significantly from 0.82 +/- 0.06 to 0.90 +/- 0.06 and that of normal (n = 5) was not changed from 0.94 +/- 0.03 to 0.95 +/- 0.01. Raise up 99mTc-HMPAO brain SPECT enhanced the detectability in abnormality of regional cerebral blood flow and visualized the dys-autoregulated area during blood pressure falls.
