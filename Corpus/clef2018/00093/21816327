Normal magnetic resonance imaging of the thorax. The soft tissue contrast properties of magnetic resonance (MR) allow excellent discrimination of most intrathoracic structures other than the lungs, and allow good insight into normal anatomy. Using MR imaging, the normal cardiorespiratory system, including portions of the lungs and pleural spaces, as well as the mediastinal, chest wall, and cardiac structures can be well depicted. In addition, using newer MR pulse sequences, dynamic ECG-gated imaging can also be achieved, which allows a window into the normal functional processes of these organs.
