Improved hypertrophy of future remnant liver after portal vein embolization with plugs, coils and particles. To retrospectively analyze efficacy as measured by volume gain of future remnant liver (FRL) after right portal vein embolization (PVE) using particles only versus particles and additional central plug and/or coil (CP/C) embolization.All patients who underwent PVE between July 2011 and December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Right PVE was performed either with particle-only (PO) embolization or additional CP/C embolization. All enrolled patients underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging before PVE and surgery. The images were used for volumetry of the FRL.Of 75 patients, 40 had PO and 35 CP/C embolization. Age, sex, and tumor entities did not differ significantly between the two groups. Tumor entities included cholangiocarcinoma (n = 52), metastasis from colorectal cancer (n = 14), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 2), and others (n = 7). Time from PVE to preoperative imaging was similar in both groups. FRL volume before PVE was 329 ± 121 ml in the PO group and 333 ± 135 ml in the CP/C group, and 419 ± 135 ml and 492 ± 165 ml before operation. The average percentage volume gain was significantly higher in the CP/C group than in the PO group, with 53.3 ± 34.5 % versus 30.9 ± 28.8 % (p = 0.002).Right PVE with additional CP/C embolization leads to a significantly higher gain in FRL volume than embolization with particles alone.
