How long should we follow the post-transplantation patient after graft loss? A case report of renal cancer in the grafted kidney that occurred 16 years after graft loss. Renal cancers commonly occur in the native kidneys of renal transplant recipients, whereas renal cancer in the grafted kidney has been reported occasionally. Renal cancer in the grafted kidney occurred 16 years after graft loss in this case, which would be a more rare case.A 60-year-old man who had a kidney transplant from his mother at the age of 31 years and had hemodialysis again because of chronic rejection from the age of 44 years had right lower abdominal pain. Computerized tomography (CT) showed tumor involvement in the grafted kidney. Positron-emission tomography-CT also showed hot spots in the liver, cervical vertebra, and costal bone. Needle biopsy for grafted kidney and liver tumors were done, and pathologic findings revealed renal cancer of grafted kidney and metastatic liver tumor. Graftectomy was done, and renal cancer was diagnosed as spindle cell carcinoma. Irradiation for cervical bone metastasis was done after the surgery. He complained of abdominal pain and eating disturbance 2 months after the surgery. CT showed a huge recurrence tumor and multiple tumor dissemination. Small intestine was involved and obstructed by the main tumor. He died of recurrence of renal cancer 3 months after the surgery.It is reported that the rate of renal cell carcinoma in the grafted kidney was 0.19%-0.5% and it occurred at a mean of 12.6 years after renal transplantation. Herein, we report a rare case of renal cancer that occurred 29 years after renal transplantation. Long-term observation should be required for recipients who had rehemodialysis.
