Diagnosis and treatment of choledochoceles. Choledochoceles are cystic dilatations of the intraduodenal portion of the common bile duct. Although often classified as Type III biliary cysts, choledochoceles have distinctive demographic and anatomic features and a lower risk of malignancy than other types of choledochal cysts. Type A choledochoceles are cystic dilatations of a segment of the intra-ampullary bile duct and are located proximal to the ampullary orifice. Type B choledochoceles are diverticula of the intra-ampullary common channel and are located distal to the ampullary orifice they can be distinguished from duodenal duplication cysts both anatomically and histologically. Both types of choledochocele may present with pancreatitis, biliary obstruction, or nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. Cross-sectional imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are useful for diagnosis. Choledochoceles may be drained or resected endoscopically. Surveillance for dysplasia should be considered for lesions that are not resected.
