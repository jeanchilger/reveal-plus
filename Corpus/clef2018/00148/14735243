Diagnosis of biliary tract carcinoma. There are several diagnostic tools available in the diagnosis of bile duct cancer. Tumors of the middle and distal part of the extrahepatic bile duct are accessible to endosonography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERC) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) are the most invasive procedures for diagnosis of bile duct cancer. However, they offer the opportunity to obtain material for cytological or histological investigation. Moreover, bile flow can be assured by inserting endoprostheses during the procedure. Cholangioscopy and/or intraductal ultrasonography can be performed during ERC. They confer to the diagnosis of a malignant bile duct tumor and are the most accurate methods to diagnose the extent of longitudinal spread. Magnetic resonance imaging-cholangiography is an efficient diagnostic procedure which should be used first, if the bile duct tumor is located in the hilar region.
