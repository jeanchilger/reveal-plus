Choledochal cyst: comparison of MR and conventional cholangiography. To assess the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography versus conventional cholangiography in patients with choledochal cyst and to determine whether MR cholangiography can be considered an alternative to conventional cholangiography.Thirteen patients with choledochal cyst were examined by MR cholangiography and conventional cholangiograms. Magnetic resonance cholangiography employed T2-weighted axial and coronal fast spin-echo, single and multislab single-shot fast spin-echo sequences, including source images with maximum intensity projections. The diagnostic value of MR cholangiography and conventional cholangiograms was assessed and compared using the criteria of depiction of morphology, anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct union and demonstration of complications such as stones. A four-point diagnostic scale was applied to the delineation of the ductal anatomy with the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test and McNemar's test used for statistical analysis.The depiction of the choledochal cyst was significantly better with MR cholangiography than with conventional cholangiography (P = 0.03). The detection rate of an anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct union was not significantly different with either method (P = 0.641), nor was the detection rate of bile duct stones (P = 0.375).Magnetic resonance cholangiography provides data equivalent to or superior to those from conventional cholangiography in evaluating choledochal cyst. Magnetic resonance cholangiography is recommended as a non-invasive examination of choice for the evaluation of choledochal cyst.
