Mesenteric cavernous hemangioma involving small bowel and appendix: a rare presentation of a vascular tumor. We report on a case of cavernous hemangioma of the small bowel mesentery. Fewer than five cases of large mesenteric cavernous hemangioma have been reported in the English literature. Cavernous hemangioma of the small bowel mesentery is extremely rare. A 32-year-old black male presented with 1 week of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. He had recently undergone computed tomographic guided biopsy of a pelvic mass at another facility. Repeat CT guided biopsy was nondiagnostic, mesenteric angiography was inconclusive, and magnetic resonance imaging was performed as well. Complete workup was performed to localize primary source of abdominal mass and eventual open biopsy was planned resulting in en bloc resection of the mass, which had invaded the terminal ileum and appendix. Final pathologic diagnosis was cavernous mesenteric hemangioma. The patient experienced a prolonged postoperative ileus and was eventually discharged in stable condition, tolerating a regular diet with adequate bowel and urinary function. Diagnosis of cavernous mesenteric hemangioma is difficult and multiple imaging modalities can prove inconclusive. Adequate biopsy can be difficult to obtain even in patients with small body habitus. Standard of care is resection of entire mass en bloc.
