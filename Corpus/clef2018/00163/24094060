Increase in Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A infections in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, January 2011 to August 2013. We report an increased number of Salmonella enterica Paratyphi A infections in adults in Cambodia. Between January 2011 and August 2013, 71 S. Paratyphi A isolates were recovered from blood cultures, representing a 44-fold increase compared to July 2007 to December 2010, while monthly numbers of cultures did not change. Infections with S. Typhi increased two-fold in the same period. Most cases came from the capital Phnom Penh. These findings warrant epidemiological investigation to support public health measures.
