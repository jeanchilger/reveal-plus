A case of fatal acute pyogenic meningitis in a neonate caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Salmonella group B. Salmonellosis constitutes an important public health problem throughout the world. In severe infections like meningitis and septicemia, antibiotic treatment is essential. Extended-spectrum cephalosporins are preferentially used to treat salmonellosis in children. Treatment failures due to in-vivo acquisition of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene in nontyphoidal salmonellae are now well established. A 45-day-old male baby presented to the pediatric intensive care unit with a history of fever, poor feeding, two episodes of seizures of 3 days duration and recurrent apnoea. At admission, cerebrospinal fluid, stool and blood cultures were done and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was isolated from all the samples. The stool isolate was confirmed to be ESBL producing. The baby expired due to acute pyogenic meningitis.
