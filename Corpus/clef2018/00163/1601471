Plasmid mediated multidrug resistance in Salmonella typhi. Between September 1989 and February 1991, strains of S. typhi showing multiple drug resistance were isolated from blood cultures of patients with typhoid fever. A total of 283 isolates were obtained over a period of 18 months. Forty four (11%) of these isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and tetracycline, the first three being drugs currently used in treating typhoid fever. Forty of the 44 multi-resistant strains tested showed transfer of resistance 'en block' to recipient Escherichia coli K 12 (J62-2). All 44 multi-resistant strains were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Since the resistance is plasmid-mediated, the problem is likely to get aggravated.
