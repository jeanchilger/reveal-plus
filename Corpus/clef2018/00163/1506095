Multidrug resistant typhoid fever: therapeutic considerations. Forty six blood culture positive cases were studied during the current outbreak of multidrug resistant typhoid fever (MRTF). The present outbreak was caused by E1 phage type and organisms were resistant to all commonly used drugs for the treatment of typhoid fever, viz., chloramphenicol (78%), co-trimoxazole (76%) and ampicillin (68%). Treatment failures with chloramphenicol (45.5%) corroborated well with in vitro resistance. No treatment failure was seen with chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone, when these drugs were used in cases infected with sensitive strains. Among the alternative drugs used in cases with in vitro sensitivity, successful clinical response was seen with ceftriaxone (4/4) and cefotaxime (8/9) as compared to cephalexin (3/5) or a combination of cephalexin and furazolidone (9/12).
