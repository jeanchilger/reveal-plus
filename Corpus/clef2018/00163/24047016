Studies on extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing salmonella isolates from clinical samples of Nepal. Present study was carried out among the patients of age 2-60 years from November 2009 to November 2011 to assess the production of Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) by salmonella enterica serotype (Typhi and paratyphi A) at Kanti Children's Hospital (KCH), Nepal Medical College (NMC), Kathmandu Medical College (KMC), National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) and Sankata Laboratory (SKL) of Nepal. Blood cultures were obtained from 4,820 patients with febrile illnesses. 400 strains of salmonella enterica were isolated. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out using disk diffusion method by Kirby-Bauer technique and ESBL screening were done by Double Disk Synergy Test (DDST), following the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) recommendations for Escherichia coli. Male had higher infection (56%) than female (44%). Highest number of culture positive cases were (37%) in 10-19 years of age groups. Highest episodes of enteric fever cases occurred during April - June (45%) followed by July-September (35%). Among the total isolates 286 (72%) were Multidrug resistance (MDR). All the Multidrugs resistance salmonella, resistant to third generation Cephlospornis were ESBL producers.
