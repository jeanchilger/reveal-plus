Functional reorganisation in patients with right hemisphere stroke after training of alertness: a longitudinal PET and fMRI study in eight cases. In patients with alertness deficits due to right hemispheric vascular brain damage, training induced changes in the individual functional networks involved in intrinsic alertness were assessed in a longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET)/fMRI activation study. Patients were trained by administering the alertness routine of the AIXTENT computerized attention training or, in the control condition, by using a computerized training of verbal and topological memory. Before and after the training, both a PET/fMRI and a neuropsychological assessment were carried out. In this paper, we are presenting four patients after alertness training: three, whose alertness performance improved significantly after training, and one, who did not improve. In the patients showing behavioural improvement, the PET/fMRI activation after training revealed partial restitution of the right hemisphere (RH) functional network known to subserve intrinsic alertness in normal subjects, especially in the right dorsolateral or medial frontal cortex. For the patient without behavioural improvement, the PET activation after training showed an increase of activation only in the left hemisphere. Out of the four patients in the memory training control group only one showed significant improvement of alertness. Another patient had an increase of right frontal activation after the training but this did not correspond to behavioural improvement. In a control group of six normal participants, repetition of the alertness activation paradigm in fMRI revealed a decrease of right frontal and parietal activation from the first to a second measurement after 3 weeks, in contrast to the observed training induced effects in the patients.
