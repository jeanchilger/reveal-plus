A SPECT imaging study of MRI white matter hyperintensity in patients with degenerative dementia. We investigated the correlation between cortical perfusion and white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance images (MRI) of patients with dementia. The study included 40 subjects, each of whom had undergone both MRI and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies as part of their diagnostic evaluation for degenerative dementia. Two neuroradiologists rated the MRI films for severity of periventricular white matter changes on a 0-5 point scale and severity of subcortical white matter changes on a 0-4 point scale. Twelve regions of interest from association cortex were sampled for the semiquantitative analysis of SPECT images. No relationship was found between these global MRI ratings and semiquantitative or qualitative SPECT findings. Dementia severity as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Clinical Dementia Rating was significantly correlated with SPECT, whereas age was significantly correlated with MRI ratings, particularly in the periventricular regions. These data support the view that cortical SPECT abnormalities are not associated with global MRI abnormalities in the subcortical and periventricular regions of patients with a clinical picture of degenerative dementia.
