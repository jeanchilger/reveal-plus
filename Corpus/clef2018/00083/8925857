Staging of non-small-cell lung cancer by whole-body fluorine-18 deoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG), showing increased FDG uptake and retention in malignant cells, has been proven useful to differentiate malignant from benign tissue. We undertook a prospective study in 61 patients to compare the accuracy of whole-body FDG PET and conventional imaging (CI) methods for the staging of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CI included chest and abdomen computed tomographic scanning and bone scintigraphy. When CI or PET study suggested metastatic disease, confirmation was obtained by biopsy or clinical or radiological follow-up. As compared to CI, PET correctly changed the N stage in 13 patients (21%) and the M stage in six patients (10%). There were three false-positive and no false-negative distant PET findings. Our preliminary results show that whole-body FDG PET can improve the diagnostic accuracy in the staging of NSCLC.
