Clinical features of 5 cases of tuberculous meningitis--with special reference to brain CT and MRI findings. We evaluated the clinical features of 5 cases of tuberculous meningitis who had been admitted to our department from 1987 to 1994. Three patients were male and two were female. Their age ranged from 17 to 74 years old. All cases were examined by both CT and MRI before and during antituberculous treatment. Before the treatment, CT scan revealed abnormal findings such as nodular lesion suggesting tuberculoma, subarachnoid contrast enhancement or cerebral infarction in 2 cases, while MRI revealed abnormal findings such as inflammatory lesions with Gd-enhancement in 4 out of 5 patients. During the treatment, all abnormal findings except cerebral infarction disappeared. No abnormal findings were detected by CT. MRI and SPECT in one case who showed right hemiparesis and motor aphasia. In summary, CT scan could demonstrate abnormal findings in only a small portion of patients with tuberculous meningitis. One the other hand, MRI revealed various abnormal findings in most patients, and could reveal some lesions which could be responsible for the symptoms of patients. In a few patients, however, MRI could not show any lesion in spite of obvious focal neurological signs. MRI is considered to be useful for detecting the lesions in most patients with tuberculous meningitis, although its findings are not always specific for the disease.
