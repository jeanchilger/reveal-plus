201Tl SPET in the differential diagnosis of brain tumours. The aims of this study were to assess the utility of 201Tl single photon emission tomography (SPET) in the differential diagnosis of brain tumours and to elucidate the relationship between 201Tl tumour uptake and degree of contrast-enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Early (15 min) and delayed (3 h) 201Tl SPET imaging and T1-weighted MRI were performed before and after Gd-DTPA enhancement in 101 (41 malignant and 60 benign) untreated brain tumours. The 201Tl uptake ratio (tumour-to-normal brain count ratio) for both the early and delayed SPET studies and the retention index (the ratio of delayed to early 201Tl uptake) were calculated. Malignant tumours were separated from benign tumours with 87% accuracy based on the assumption that tumours with a 201Tl retention index < 0.7 or no abnormal uptake are benign. Meningiomas and pituitary adenomas were differentiated from other benign tumours by their characteristic pattern on SPET. The degree of contrast-enhancement of the tumour on MRI was concordant with the early 201Tl uptake ratio for most histological types. However, schwannomas and cavernous haemangiomas showed a low 201Tl uptake ratio in spite of a high degree of contrast-enhancement on MRI. In conclusion, 201Tl SPET provides additional information that helps in the differential diagnosis of brain tumours.
