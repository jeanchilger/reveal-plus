Three-step tumor pre-targeting in lung cancer immunoscintigraphy. Radiolabelled MoAbs have been used in both the diagnosis and the treatment of a variety of tumors. Recently, a three-step tumor pre-targeting strategy has been proposed to overcome one of the major limiting factors in radioimmunodetection: the low tumor-to-background ratio. We evaluated this pre-targeting protocol in 10 patients diagnosed as having pulmonary carcinoma. One milligram of biotinylated anti-CEA MoAb (FO23C5) was administered i.v. (1st step) 24 hours later 5 mg of avidin was injected i.v. (2nd step) followed by 100-500 ng of 111In-biotin (5 mCi) the day after (3rd step). Imaging was performed using single photon emission tomography (SPET). No toxicity and no adverse reactions were observed. Tumor was detected in 8 out of 10 patients. Mediastinal metastases were also localised in 2 out of 3 patients, and adrenal gland recurrency in 1 out of 2 patients. The tumor/background (normal lung), heart, liver and spine ratios were respectively 2.0, 1.0, 1.3 and 4.1 at 90 minutes post-injection. These preliminary data show that the three-step pretargeting method is safe and allows SPECT tumor localization soon after the injection of the radiolabel. In the future, the use of MoAbs with higher specificity could result in improved tumor-targeting, and in the possibility of lung cancer radioimmunotherapy.
