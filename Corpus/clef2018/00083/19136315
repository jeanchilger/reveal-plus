A rodent model of metabolic surgery for study of type 2 diabetes and positron emission tomography scanning of beta cell mass. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a worldwide healthcare problem with major socioeconomic implications. Metabolic surgical procedures have been shown to improve diabetes, but the mechanism of action is poorly understood. The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rodent is a type 2 diabetic animal model that is ideally situated for studying the effect of surgery on diabetes however, the operative mortality is high. The aim of this study was to describe the operative technique, improvements in perioperative management, and the technique of micro-positron emission tomography (PET) scanning of the beta-cell mass in GK rodents.A total of 53 GK rats were divided into 1 of 3 operative groups: sham, sleeve gastrectomy, and duodenojejunal bypass. A subset of animals underwent micro-PET scanning with [11C]-dihydrotetrabenazine to determine the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 binding index, an indicator of beta-cell mass.The 30-day mortality in the sham and sleeve gastrectomy rodents was 0 however, 2 sleeve gastrectomy rodents developed enterocutaneous fistula and 1 developed an abscess. In the duodenojejunal bypass group, the initial mortality rate was close to 90%Intensive medical management in the perioperative period and attention to the operative technique lowered the mortality. [11C]-Dihydrotetrabenazine micro-PET scanning is a feasible method for assessing the beta-cell mass in GK rodents and could prove to be an important modality for evaluating beta-cell performance in type 2 diabetes.
