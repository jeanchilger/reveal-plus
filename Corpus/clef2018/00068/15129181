Outcome of acutely ischemic brain tissue in prolonged middle cerebral artery occlusion: a serial positron emission tomography investigation in the baboon. Thrombolysis within 3 to 6 hours of symptom onset is recommended therapy for acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, but recent imaging studies in humans suggest that the penumbra may last much longer in some patients. It is therefore important to study the events that take place with occlusions that last longer than 6 hours. Based upon positron emission tomography (PET), the tissue with high oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) is at risk of infarction. In a previous sequential PET study in anesthetized baboons, we documented that when reperfusion was initiated at 6 hours after MCA occlusion, the region with the acutely highest OEF was not incorporated within the final magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-defined infarct, suggesting reperfusion prevented such demise. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report here using the same sequential PET paradigm with final chronic-stage volume MRI that a 20-hour MCA occlusion resulted in, on average, 36% of the highest OEF area being recruited into the final infarct. We also found that the portion of the highest OEF area that went on to infarct had at the earliest time-point significantly lower cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen metabolism (mean reductions relative to unoccluded side, 56% and 32%, respectively) than the portion that did not (41% and 11%, respectively) and that some reperfusion occurred in the latter at second time-point, that is, before recanalization. Thus, apart from duration of occlusion, the fate of the at-risk tissue is predicated by the initial severity of the ischemia as well as by early secondary events such as partial spontaneous reperfusion.
