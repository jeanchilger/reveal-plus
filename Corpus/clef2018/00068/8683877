Diagnosis of lung cancer using functional image of 201Tl SPECT with parameter of 201Tl retention--evaluation of its applicability to post irradiated lung cancer. Thallium-201 (201Tl) SPECT is a useful method for detecting lung cancer. Moreover, the 201Tl Retention Index (R.I.) reported by Tonami et al is now available for differentiating pulmonary lung cancer from benign lesions. The diagnosis of recurrent tumors is, however, difficult to establish as they are often shaded by radiation pneumonitis or fibrosis. Therefore, we employed functional images (F.I.) obtained using as parameter a modified version of the R.I. First we indicated the statistical value of untreated solitary lung tumor as follows: sensitivity 84.6%, specificity 80.0%, and accuracy 83.3%. In our assessment, the lesions with tumor size over 2.0 cm and R.I. by Tonami et al over 12.7 were detected as positive images. Secondly in assessment of 22 cases (23 lesions) of post irradiated lung cancer, the results obtained were: sensitivity 80.0%, specificity 92.3%, and accuracy 87.0%. 201Tl SPECT functional images seem to be useful for the diagnosis of recurrent lung cancer by shaded radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis.
