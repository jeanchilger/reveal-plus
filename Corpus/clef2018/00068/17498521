In vivo tracking in cardiac stem cell-based therapy. Cell-based therapy has been heralded as a promising, novel therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases. Despite a rapid transition from animal studies to clinical trials, there remain numerous unresolved, and at times, controversial issues with respect to underlying molecular mechanisms. In parallel, recent advances in the field of molecular imaging has provided a means to bridge the gap in knowledge through in vivo stem cells tracking. Herein, we review current in vivo imaging techniques and future directions for tracking the effects of cell-based therapy.
