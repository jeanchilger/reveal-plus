Role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for the evaluation of mediastinal adenopathy. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be detected by CT-scan or positron emission tomography. Malignant (e.g, lung cancer, metastatic cancer, lymphoma), infectious (e.g, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis), and systemic processes (e.g, sarcoidosis) can cause mediastinal adenopathy. In the posterior and inferior mediastinum, endoscopic ultrasound visualizes and directs transesophageal fine needle aspiration of adenopathy. In the anterior mediastinum, endobronchial ultrasound visualizes and directs transbronchial fine needle aspiration of adenopathy. We discuss the role of EUS and EBUS in the evaluation of mediastinal adenopathy according to their anatomical localization.
