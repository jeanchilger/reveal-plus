Malignant pleural mesothelioma: evaluation with CT, MR imaging, and PET. Imaging plays an essential role in the evaluation of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Computed tomography is the primary imaging modality used for the diagnosis and staging of MPM. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and, more recently, positron emission tomography (PET) have emerged as modalities that can provide additional important diagnostic and prognostic information to help further delineate the extent of disease, especially in surgical candidates. Use of MR imaging performed with different pulse sequences and gadolinium-based contrast material can improve the detection of tumor extension, especially to the chest wall and diaphragm. PET can provide both anatomic and metabolic information, especially in cases of extrathoracic and mediastinal nodal metastasis. Each imaging modality has its advantages and limitations, but their combined use is crucial in determining the most appropriate treatment options for patients with MPM.
