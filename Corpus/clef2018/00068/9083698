Combined revascularization surgery for childhood moyamoya disease: STA-MCA and encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis. We present surgical techniques for optimal revascularization in childhood moyamoya disease. During the past 10 years we performed revascularization surgery for childhood moyamoya disease using direct revascularization with superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis and indirect revascularization of encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis (EDAMS) 43 times. Points of this surgery are as follows: (1) craniotomy and dural opening for the most extensive possible exposure of the brain surface, (2) protective manipulation of the STA, temporal muscle and middle meningeal artery, (3) STA-MCA anastomosis to the frontal branch of the MCA to improve cerebral circulation of the frontal lobe using a small branch of the STA, and (4) a small opening in the arachnoid membrane and watertight closure.
