Burkitt lymphoma associated with large gastric folds, pancreatic involvement, and biliary tract obstruction. Large gastric folds in adults are seen in many benign and malignant conditions, but they are rare in children with malignant diseases such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The authors report a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who had large gastric folds and jaundice as the initial symptoms. A 14-year-old boy was referred to the authors' hospital with upper abdominal pain and jaundice. A standard barium upper gastrointestinal series showed large gastric folds in the entire stomach. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a typical diffuse infiltrating type of pancreatic lymphoma. Because complete bilateral lower limb paralysis developed as a result of the epidural soft tissue mass, laminectomy and tumor resection were performed and a diagnosis of disseminated Burkitt lymphoma was established. After completing 6 months of chemotherapy, the patient has been disease-free without neurologic complications for 2.5 years.
