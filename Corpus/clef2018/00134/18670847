Epidermoid cyst originating from an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. We report a rare case of an epidermoid cyst originating from an intrapancreatic accessory spleen, in a 40-year-old Japanese man with no clinical symptoms. A cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail was detected incidentally by abdominal ultrasonography. The patient was referred to the KKR Tachikawa Hospital for further examination of the tumor. Preoperative imaging findings suggested that the tumor was an epidermoid cyst originating from an intrapancreatic accessory spleen. On both pre-and post-contrast computed tomography and magnetic resonance images, the solid compartment of the tumor had the same X-ray attenuation and intensity as the spleen. Upon surgical excision, the mass consisted of solid and cystic components that were macroscopically evident on the preoperative images. Microscopic analysis revealed that the solid component was an accessory spleen in the pancreatic tail, whereas the cystic component was lined with stratified epithelium representative of an epidermoid cyst. This is the thirteenth report (in English) of an epidermoid cyst originating from an intrapancreatic accessory spleen, and the first case to be diagnosed prior to surgery.
