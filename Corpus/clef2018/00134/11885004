Solid-pseudopapillary tumors in childhood. We report on fife female patients with solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas. The tumors are extremely rare in children. They occur mainly in adolescent and young adult females. The tumors are neoplasms of low malignancy with infrequent metastases, for instance, in the liver or the peritoneum. Although the tumors had reached a large diameter, all of them underwent complete tumor resection. After that the patients have a very good prognosis. Thus, so it is important to distinguish solid-pseudopapillary tumors from other tumors of the pancreas.
