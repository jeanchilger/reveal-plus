Limited efficacy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for differentiation between metastasis-free pancreatic cancer and mass-forming pancreatitis. Differentiation between metastasis-free pancreatic cancer and mass-forming pancreatitis is important to avoid unnecessary operative procedures. This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of PET/CT with F-FDG (FDG PET/CT) for the differential diagnosis between them.FDG-PET/CT was performed in 47 study patients with pancreatic masses and without any detectable metastases, 33 of which cases were finally diagnosed as pancreatic cancer and the other 14 as pancreatitis, and the corresponding imaging data were evaluated retrospectively. The maximal SUV (SUVmax) within the masses were determined at 1 hour and mostly at 2 hours after intravenous injection of FDG.SUVmax at 1 hour in pancreatic cancer was significantly higher than that in mass-forming pancreatitis, and the change in SUVmax from 1- to 2-hour time points was more consistent with pancreatic cancer than with mass-forming pancreatitis. However, there remained considerable overlapping between the SUVmax values of both diseases except either at the higher range for pancreatic cancer (> 7.7 at 1 hour or > 9.98 at 2 hours) or at the lower range for mass-forming pancreatitis (<3.37 at 1 hour or <3.53 at 2 hours). No obvious difference was found in the FDG uptake patterns of the mass areas between both diseases.Differentiation between metastasis-free pancreatic cancer and mass-forming pancreatitis is difficult by FDG-PET/CT due to considerable overlapping between the SUVmax values of the two diseases, although the differential diagnosis may be possible either at the higher range of SUVmax (> 7.7 at 1 hour or > 9.98 at 2 hours) for pancreatic cancer or at the lower range of SUVmax (<3.37 at 1 hour or <3.53 at 2 hours) for mass-forming pancreatitis.
