Advances in pediatric cardiology and congenital heart diseases. This article reviews the most significant developments reported between July 2006 and July 2007 in the fields of pediatric cardiology and congenital heart disease, in diagnosis and treatment in particular. In the area of imaging techniques, the increasing clinical roles of magnetic resonance imaging, tissue Doppler imaging and three-dimensional echocardiography are highlighted, as is the application of these techniques to fetal cardiology and its repercussions. The incidence and treatment of arrhythmias in children are also discussed and, with regard to heart failure, there is an assessment of recent findings in epidemiology and diagnosis, new drugs, ventricular assist systems, and the current status of heart transplantation. In the area of interventional cardiology, present-day techniques for the closure of atrial and ventricular septal defects are reviewed and there is an assessment of early results with partially absorbable devices, percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation, and new types of stent (e.g., premounted, coated and absorbable stents). In cardiac surgery, the focus is on studies that evaluate outcome quality, the search for new biocompatible conduits, experience with new techniques for treating complex transpositions (e.g., the Nikaidoh procedure and its variants), the medium- and long-term results of treating aortic valvular disease with pulmonary autografts (i.e., the Ross and Ross-Konno procedures), and current findings on the treatment of pulmonary insufficiency after correction of either the tetralogy of Fallot or a dysfunctional Fontan circuit.
