One-staged operation for mitral regurgitation and annuloaortic ectasia without aortic regurgitation with Marfan syndrome report of a case. A 32-year-old man with Marfan syndrome was admitted to our hospital for detail examination of congestive heart failure. Doppler echocardiography showed severe mitral regurgitation due to prolapse of posterior mitral leaflet. Annuloaortic ectasia without aortic regurgitation was also detected by aortography. Considering the future operative need for aortic root and ascending aorta, we performed mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve and preventive concomitant aortic root replacement with a composite valve graft. His postoperative course was uneventful. Optimal surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation and annuloaortic ectasia in Marfan syndrome is controversial because the underlying connective tissue defect theoretically might compromise repair durability. Several surgical options for mitral regurgitation and annuloaortic ectasia in Marfan syndrome are discussed.
