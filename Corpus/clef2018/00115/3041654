Duplex scanner study of carotid artery dissection following surgical treatment of aortic dissection type A. In patients suffering from aortic dissection, persistent perfusion of the false lumen distal to the implanted graft is frequent. Postoperative follow-up examinations of the carotid arteries of these patients were performed by duplex scanner and correlated with clinical symptoms. Thirty-nine patients who survived the surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection had duplex sonography of both common carotid arteries after an average postoperative follow-up of 53 months. In 21 cases a composite graft and in 18 cases a supracoronary prosthetic vascular graft were implanted. No sign of residual dissection of the common carotid arteries was seen in 23 patients in nine there was a dissection of both common carotid arteries, and seven patients had a unilateral carotid dissection (five right, two left). There were nine symptomatic patients with the following symptoms: transient ischemic attack (four), amaurosis fugax (four), stroke with incomplete recovery (one). Two symptomatic patients had a corresponding dissection. The generally good prognosis of all these patients suggests a conservative nonoperative treatment.
