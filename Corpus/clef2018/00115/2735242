The retroperitoneal liposarcoma: a case report. A 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of a mass in the right abdomen. Ultrasonography, aortography and computed tomographic (CT) scanning revealed the right kidney displaced by a huge and avascular mass containing fatty tissue. Also magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that it was contained of lipomatous tissue and demonstrated the mass occupying the entire right abdominal cavity. The tumor including the right kidney was resected, following diagnosis of the retroperitoneal tumor. The exercised tumor measured 28 X 22 X 18 cm and weighed 2,010g. The histological diagnosis was well-differentiated liposarcoma. She has been healthy for three months following postoperative chemotherapy. Many reports have been made on the ultrasonographic and CT appearance of retroperitoneal liposarcoma, but few have been made on the MRI appearance. According to our case, imaging diagnosis by MRI also seems to be useful in making a histological diagnosis of liposarcoma.
