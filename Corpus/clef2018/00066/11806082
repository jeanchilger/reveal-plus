Examination concerning dissociation of left ventricular volume calculation value based on difference of analytical algorithm and perfusion tracer in gated myocardial SPECT. According to improvement of SPECT system, ECG-gated SPECT with 201TlCl have been applied to the left ventricular volumetry. In this study 24 patients without ischemia demonstrated by stress (99mTc-TF) and rest (201TlCl) dual-isotope ECG-gated myocardial SPECT were enrolled. To evaluate left ventricular volumetry using 201Tl ECG-gated SPECT data, the left ventricular end diastolic volumes (EDV) were compared between Quantitative Gated SPECT (QGS) and Emory Cardiac Toolbox (ECT) as well as between dual-isotopes based on the same ECG-gated data. The EDV values with 99mTc data (EDVTc) using QGS were well correlated with those using ECT (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001). Both QGS and ECT demonstrated well correlation between EDVTc (r = 0.98, p < 0.0001) and the EDV value with 201Tl (EDVTl) (r = 0.93, p < 0.0001). However, QGS processing induced significantly lower EDVTl compared with EDVTc. In contrast, EDVTl were significantly higher than EDVTc in ECT performance. The QGS errors subtracting EDVTl from EDVTc were more evident according to the left ventricular volume increase. On the other hand, ECT error showed no tendency associated with the left ventricular volume. From these results, a careful strategy for selection of tracers and softwares should be necessary to assessment of quantitative values derived from ECG-gated SPECT data because of interaction with softwares, tracers, and subjects.
