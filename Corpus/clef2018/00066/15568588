Auditing a new lung cancer service. The Adelaide and Meath Hospital (AMNCH) is a new hospital, with the respiratory service established in 1999. We report on our experience with lung cancer in this short time. We conducted a retrospective chart audit, identifying patients from the Oncology Nurse patient list, of lung cancer cases diagnosed in 2001-2002. In 2001, 47 cases were diagnosed, with 71 cases diagnosed in 2002. Time to tissue diagnosis was 14.8, 2-46 (mean, range, one subject skewing the data) days. Diagnosis by tissue type was as follows: non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) n=92 (77.9%), small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) n=17 (14.4%), mesothelioma n=2 (17%), carcinoid n=1 (0.8%) and no tissue diagnosis n=6 (5.1%). Staging of NSCLC: stage 1a n=3 (3.2%), stage 1b n=6 (6.5%), stage 2a n=5 (5.4%), stage 2b n=2 (2.2%), stage 3a n=10 (10.9%), stage 3b n=22 (23.9%) and stage 4 n=44 (47.8%). Staging of SCLC: limited stage n=5 (29.4%), extensive stage n=12 (70.6%). Positive emission tomography (PET) was employed in the staging of 22 patients. In these patients PET up-staged the disease in 8 patients, and management was unchanged in 8 patients. We conclude that 1. the relatively new respiratory service in AMNCH is handling increasing numbers of lung cancer cases, 2. cases are diagnosed within an acceptable time-frame, 3. rate of tissue diagnosis is comparable to national figures, 4. most patients present with advanced disease and 5. PET is a useful imaging modality for detection of cancer spread in selected patients.
