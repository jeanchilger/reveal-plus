Prognostic value of myocardial perfusion gated SPECT in patients with symptomatic intracranial large-artery atherosclerosis. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of myocardial perfusion gated SPECT in patients with symptomatic intracranial large-artery atherosclerosis (ILA).Seventy-two consecutive first-ever symptomatic ILA patients without known heart disease underwent a stress myocardial perfusion gated SPECT, and long-term follow-up was conducted thereafter.During an average follow-up of 15.2 +/- 9 months, 9 patients (13.8%) presented major coronary events (CEs). Survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression) identified presence of moderate-to-severe myocardial perfusion defects (log rank p = 0.004) and ejection fraction <50% (p = 0.014) as predictors of future CEs. Neurovascular ischemic events were not predicted by SPECT variables.Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy predicts future CEs in patients with symptomatic ILA and may be helpful to guide therapeutic strategies in this subgroup of stroke patients.
