Role of FDG-PET/CT in follow-up of patients treated with resective gastric surgery for tumour. Gastric cancer has a poor prognosis and a high rate of recurrences after surgery. The optimal method for assessing early recurrences is not defined: conventional imaging (ultrasonography, CT and MRI) have difficulty in detecting them, because they don't give information regarding metabolic features or tumor response to chemotherapy. Actually 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission (18FDG-PET) has several indications for the primary staging and the follow-up of colon-rectal, lung, breast, neck cancers and lymphoma, but its clinical role in gastric cancer is not assessed. Our study analyzes the role of 18FDG-PET integrated with CT scan in the detection of gastric cancer recurrence.We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients which underwent follow-up 18FDG-PET/CT from 2006 to 2009 after radical surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma. Each study was repeated every 6 months for the first two years after surgery and every 12 months for the subsequent three years.18FDG-PET/CT was positive for suspected neoplastic disease in 29 (58%) and negative in 21 (42%) patients, with 3 false positive and 3 false negative results. 18FDG-PET/CT showed highly effectiveness in early detection of recurrences, as observed in 17 patients that were totally asymptomatic, allowing the initiation of multimodal treatment resulting in an important increasing of survival.18FDG-PET-CT has a very good sensitivity (89.7%) and specificity (85.7%) in detecting local and distant recurrences during post-operative follow-up. Positive 18FDG-PET/CT findings may lead to an early change in the management of these patients, directing them towards rescue surgery or chemotherapy thereby improving their overall survival
