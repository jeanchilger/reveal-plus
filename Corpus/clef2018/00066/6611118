Regional cortical dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease as determined by positron emission tomography. Local cerebral glucose metabolism and psychometric function were compared in 17 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 5 healthy age-matched controls. Performance on tests of global intellectual function averaged 30 to 45% lower in the Alzheimer's group. Mean cortical glucose metabolism, as determined by positron emission tomography following fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose administration, was reduced by 30% in the Alzheimer's group. There was a significant positive correlation between the degree of overall dementia and the amount of metabolic reduction. The distribution of cortical hypometabolism was not uniform: the posterior parietal lobes and contiguous portions of the posterior temporal and anterior occipital lobes were most severely involved. The frontal cortex was relatively spared. These findings are compatible with the major clinical deficits found in patients with Alzheimer's disease and may help focus future biochemical probes into the pathophysiology of this disease.
