Diagnostic imaging--recent progress. Current advances in the diagnostic imaging for lung cancer includes multidetector-row CT (MDCT), lung cancer screening using low-dose MDCT and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging. There is no question about the clinical usefulness of MDCT, and the further development of the hardware and the software of MDCT will open new horizons for CT diagnosis. PET is not an alternative modality to CT but a supplementary one, which adds metabolic information to the morphology. Recently, experimental research on the refraction imaging of human lung specimens has been performed with synchrotron radiation. With progressive refinement, this technique may come to have some practical purpose in diagnosing lung cancer in vivo.
