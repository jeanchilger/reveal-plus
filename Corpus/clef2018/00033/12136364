Symptomatic vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage: assessment of brain damage by diffusion and perfusion-weighted MRI and single-photon emission computed tomography. Our purpose was to assess the usefulness of diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MRI for the detection of ischaemic brain damage in patients with suspected vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). We studied 11 patients admitted with a ruptured aneurysm of the anterior circulation and suspected of intracranial vasospasm on clinical examination and transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD). All were investigated by technetium-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (Tc-HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and diffusion and perfusion-weighted MRI (DWI, PWI) within 2 weeks of their SAH. Trace images and TTP maps were interpreted by two examiners and compared with clinical and imaging follow-up. PWI revealed an area of slowed flow in seven patients, including four with major and three with minor hypoperfusion on SPECT. In two patients, PWI did not demonstrate any abnormality, while SPECT revealed major hypoperfusion in one and a minor deficit hypoperfusion in the other. Two patients with high signal on DWI had a permanent neurological deficit.
