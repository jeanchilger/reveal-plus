Management of prostate cancer recurrence after definitive radiation therapy. The management of prostate cancer (PC) recurrence after definitive radiation therapy (RT) is shifting and there is no consensus regarding the optimal strategy. The major challenge is determining the anatomical site of relapse. In case of biochemical relapse (BR), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a non-curative option commonly used, while patients with a local PC recurrence could be managed through a curative intent. Based on a Pubmed data search, this manuscript focused on the management of post-RT local PC recurrences. In case of BR (nadir+2 ng/ml), classical imaging work-up is not contributive for PSA levels <10 ng/ml while new imaging investigations (diffusion MRI, 11C-choline PET) are more sensitive to detect local and distant recurrences at lower PSA levels. Positive prostate biopsies are the only method for confirming local recurrence, although this technique presents limitations. Primary PC presentation as well as PSA-related features (interval to failure, PSA kinetic) and patient features (life expectancy, urinary, sexual status) are important to consider. Results of curative salvage options (radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, brachytherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound-HIFU) are analyzed and discussed. Each of these therapies appears feasible and has its own set of experience and toxicity profile. Other therapeutic options (photodynamic therapy, ADT, observation) are discussed. Longer follow-up and mature series are needed to evaluate the optimal strategy and prospective trials are warranted. Each clinical situation should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting. Different options should be explained to the patient and decision should be taken after balancing treatment outcomes with life expectancy.
