Expression, purification, and characterization of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. Human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is a homodimeric enzyme and each subunit is near 58 KD. It catalyzes the aminoacylation of tRNA(Tyr) by L-tyrosine. The His(6)-tagged human TyrS gene was obtained by RT-PCR from total RNA of human lung giant-cell cancer strain 95 D. It was confirmed by sequencing and cloned into the expression vector pET-24 a (+) to yield pET-24 a (+)-HTyrRS, which was transfected into Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus-RIL. The induced-expression level of His(6)-tagged human TyrRS was about 24% of total cell proteins under IPTG inducing. The recombinant protein was conveniently purified in a single step by metal (Ni(2+)) chelate affinity chromatography. About 22.3mg purified enzyme could be obtained from 1L cell culture. The k(cat) value of His(6)-tagged human TyrRS in the second step of tRNA(Tyr) aminoacylation was 1.49 s(-1). The K(m) values of tyrosine and tRNA(Tyr) were 0.3 and 0.9 microM. Six His residues at the C terminus of human TyrRS have little effect on the activities of the enzyme compared with other eukaryotic TyrRSs.
