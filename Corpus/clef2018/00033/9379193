Three-dimensional imaging of cortical structure, function and glioma for tumor resection. A three-dimensional brain imaging protocol with PET and MRI was used to visualize the cortical structure in relation to brain function and glioma infiltration to determine tumor resectability.Sixteen patients with glioma had a PET scan with 11C-methionine to visualize tumor infiltration. The PET images were co-registered to the patients' own MRI reconstructed to the three-dimensional brain surface images to indicate the gyral structure and the extent of tumor infiltration. Thirteen patients, who bore tumors adjacent to the language or motor cortex, had H2 15O activation study to locate the eloquent cortex. The area of tumor infiltration was superimposed on the brain surface images together with the language and/or motor cortex.When a tumor was located within a single gyrus without influencing surface cortical gyrus pattern, the motor and language areas were identified morphologically by three-dimensional surface image alone. However, when the tumor caused swelling and deformation of cortical structure, functional mapping with H2(15)O activation technique was essential in locating them correctly. In such cases, the combined mapping of the facial motor area with oral movement and the language area with word repetition was the most useful method to identify the parasylvian structure in the dominant hemisphere. Total or near total resection of low-grade glioma in eight patients and the effective decompression of the active part of the malignant glioma in four patients was completed without causing functional neurological deterioration.The three-dimensional expression of cortical structure and function combined with PET glioma imaging with 11C-methionine is useful for radical resection of cerebral glioma.
