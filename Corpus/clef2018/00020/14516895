Importance of ischemic and viable myocardium for patients with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction. The objective of this investigation is to determine the importance of ischemic viable myocardium for clinical outcomes in patients with severe chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation and severe left ventricular dysfunction undergoing surgical correction of mitral regurgitation. The study included 54 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of 27 +/- 9%. Positron emission tomography was performed preoperatively for the identification of ischemic viable myocardium. The patients with a large amount of ischemic viable myocardium (> or =5 segments) had significantly lower 6-month mortality rates than those with less viable myocardium (0 to 4 segments) after the surgery.
