Role of imaging techniques in the TNM classification of non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma. The Seventh Edition of the TNM Classification for non-small cell bronchogenic carcinomas include a series of changes in the T and M descriptor, in particular a re-classification of malignant pleural and pericardial effusions and of separated tumour nodes, new tumour size cut-off values and sub-divisions of the T1-T2 and M1 categories. We review these corrections that led to the changes in the staging system that affects stages II-III. Furthermore, we describe and illustrate the role of the different imaging techniques in tumour staging (CT, PET, PET-CT and MRI), highlighting their respective indications, advantages and disadvantages, as well their complementary function.
