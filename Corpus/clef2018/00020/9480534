Bronchial carcinoma: new radiologic methods. New imaging techniques, technical modifications, and new applications of established imaging techniques are discussed with regard to their cost-effectiveness in improving the end result (cure, survival, quality of life). In detecting lung cancer, two methods seem most likely to overcome the known limits of chest radiography: digital radiography with postprocessing and, for risk groups, low-dose CT. Specific diagnosis depends on detection of tiny calcifications, increased vascularization (CT, MRI) or metabolic activity (PET). Clinical staging will be improved by very short time acquisition (MRI), combination of morphologic and biological information (cross sectional techniques) and by observing metabolic activity (PET).
