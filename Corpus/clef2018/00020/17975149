Fluorine-18-alpha-methyltyrosine positron emission tomography for diagnosis and staging of lung cancer: a clinicopathologic study. L-[3-(18)F]-alpha-methyltyrosine ([(18)F]FMT) is an amino acid tracer for positron emission tomography (PET). We evaluated the diagnostic usefulness of [(18)F]FMT PET in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Tumor uptake of [(18)F]FMT was compared with that of 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) and correlated with L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) expression.Fifty NSCLC patients were enrolled in this study, and a pair of PET study with [(18)F]FMT and [(18)F]FDG was done. LAT1 expression and Ki-67 labeling index of the resected tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining.For the primary tumor detection, [(18)F]FMT PET exhibited a sensitivity of 90% whereas the sensitivity for [(18)F]FDG PET was 94%. For lymph node staging, the sensitivity and specificity of [(18)F]FMT PET were 57.8% and 100%, and those of [(18)F]FDG PET were 65.7% and 91%, respectively. The expression of LAT1 in squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma was significantly higher than that in adenocarcinoma. [(18)F]FMT uptake was also higher in squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma than in adenocarcinoma. Uptake of [(18)F]FMT in the tumor is closely correlated with LAT1 expression (rho = 0.890).[(18)F]FMT PET had no false-positives in the detection of primary tumor and lymph node metastasis and could improve the diagnostic performance in NSCLC. Uptake of [(18)F]FMT correlated with the expression of LAT1 that showed a significant association with cellular proliferation.
