 Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans that surround connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (1). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play an important role in inflammation and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (2). Invasive tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degradation of the basement membrane and ECM (3). Several families of proteases are involved in atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastasis (4-7). Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a serine protease (8, 9). The uPA/uPA receptor (uPAR) system is responsible for tissue degradation after plasminogen activation to plasmin, which leads to a cascade of proteolysis or thrombolysis, depending on the physiological conditions. uPA also directly activates MMPs, vascular endothelial growth factor, and human growth factor (10). Malignant tumors often express high levels of uPA and uPAR (11) therefore, the uPA/uPAR system is linked to vascular diseases and cancer. The synthetic peptide Asp-cyclohexylalanine-Phe-d-Ser-d-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Trp-Ser (AE105) has been identified to have a high affinity for human uPAR (dissociation constant (
