Is cerebral tomoscintigraphy with 99mTc-MIBI useful in the diagnosis of local recurrence in patients with malignant gliomas?. 99mTc-MIBI, an alternative radiopharmaceutical for myocardial perfusion study has been proposed for use as a tumor imaging agent, including breast cancer, lung cancer, lymphomas, melanomas, and brain tumors. After routine radiation therapy, deteriorating clinical status or treatment failure may be due to either radiation changes or recurrent tumor. CT and MRI offer imperfect discrimination of tumor viability and radionecrosis.Thirty-five malignant glioma patients with clinical deterioration were studied retrospectively. Tomoscintigraphy was performed 15 minutes after intravenous injection of 1110 Mbq 99mTc-MIBI. The images were obtained from a dual headed gamma camera using fan beam collimator. Transverse, coronal and sagittal views were reconstructed.A dramatic MIBI uptake was found in 31 patients. This uptake was correlated to tumor recurrence proven by histological fragments and/or the rapid, fatal evolution of these patients. Death occurred after the brain SPECT had been performed for those cases showing MIBI uptake, an average 5.48 months later. No MIBI uptake was found for these four remaining patients: their evolution can be currently considered to be a disease-free time.According to our results, the sensibility and specificity of 99mTcMIBI brain SPECT seems to be high. Moreover, this investigation is more accurate for discriminating tumor recurrence from radionecrosis than a CT scan or MRI.
