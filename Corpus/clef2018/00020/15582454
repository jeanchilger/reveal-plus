Synthesis and in vitro binding of N-phenyl piperazine analogs as potential dopamine D3 receptor ligands. A series of N-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine and N-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazine analogs were prepared and their affinities for dopamine D(2), D(3), and D(4) receptors were measured in vitro. Binding studies were also conducted to determine if the compounds bound to sigma (sigma(1) and sigma(2)) and serotonin (5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B), 5-HT(2C), 5-HT(3), 5-HT(4), 5-HT(5), 5-HT(6), and 5-HT(7)) receptors. The results of the current study revealed a number of compounds (12b, 12c, 12e, and 12g) having a high affinity for D(3) (K(i) at D(3) receptors ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 nM) versus D(2) (K(i) at D(2) receptors ranging from 40 to 53 nM) receptors and a log P value indicating that they should readily cross the blood brain barrier (log P = 2.6-3.5). All of the compounds evaluated in this study had a high affinity for serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors. These compounds may be useful as probes for studying the behavioral pharmacology of the dopamine D(3) receptor, as well as lead compounds for the development of radiotracers for studying D(3) receptor regulation in vivo with the functional imaging technique, positron emission tomography.
