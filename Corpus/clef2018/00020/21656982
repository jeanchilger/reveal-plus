 A common problem encountered with the chemotherapy or radiotherapy of cancer is the development of resistance to these treatments resulting in metastasis of the malignancy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new anti-cancer treatments that have a unique mechanism of action and are not prone to the development of drug or radiation resistance (1). Photothermal ablation (PTA) therapy is an emerging technique that uses heat produced from absorbed light to destroy cancer cells. PTA therapy can be performed frequently, has no side effects, and does not promote the development of resistance (1). For PTA therapy, near-infrared (NIR) light is used to deliver a predetermined amount of photothermal energy directly into a tumor, which stimulates photochemical and photothermal reactions within the malignant lesion that are fatal for the cancer cells (2). In addition, the application of PTA in the presence of a light-absorbing nanoparticles (NPs), such as gold NPs (shells, rods, and cages) or copper sulfide (CuS) NPs, has been shown to enhance efficacy of the therapy (3). However, many parameters, such as the dose of NIR required to maximize the efficacy of PTA therapy, the number of NPs required for optimal ablation, or how to monitor the treatment noninvasively, remain to be worked out (1). Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography are currently used to monitor morphological changes that occur after PTA therapy, but alterations in the tissue are visible with these techniques for only 2–3 months after initiation of the treatment (1). It is well known that
