Radiosurgery of liver tumors: value of robotic radiosurgical device to treat liver tumors. The treatment of isolated liver metastases has become a rapidly developing field with many new, technically advanced methods. Here we present the therapeutic efficacy of a robotic radiosurgery for local control of liver metastases from solid tumors.Patients with tumorous lesions to the liver, not qualifying for surgery, were treated with single-session radiosurgery (24 Gy) that used robotic image-guided real-time tumor tracking. All detectable lesions had to be irradiated. In a prospective analysis, follow-up was performed by magnetic resonance imaging scanning 2 months after the treatment, and subsequently at 3-month intervals to evaluate local control. For inclusion into the radiosurgery treatment protocol, tumor volumes had to be <90 ml.Thirty-six patients (median age, 65 years) with a total of 54 target lesions were evaluated. Single lesions were treated in 23 patients and multiple targets in 13 patients. Metastases originated from colon cancer (n = 19), ovarian cancer (n = 3), pancreatic cancer (n = 2), breast cancer (n = 2), and others (n = 6). Four lesions were of primary liver origin (hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma). Median tumor volume was 18 ml (range, 2.2-90 ml). The median follow-up was 21.3 months. The disease of 25 patients (69.4%) showed complete or partial local response, 6 patients (16.7%) had stable lesions, and 5 patients (14%) experienced local recurrence. Grade 2-4 adverse events due to radiation treatment were not observed.Robotic radiosurgery with image-guided real-time tumor tracking of liver neoplasm is a new and promising approach for patients with disease that is not eligible for surgical resection and might enhance the possibilities of multidisciplinary oncological treatment concepts.
