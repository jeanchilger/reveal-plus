Enhancement of the liver and pancreas in the hepatic arterial dominant phase: comparison of hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast agents, gadoxetic acid and gadobenate dimeglumine, on 3 and 1.5 Tesla MRI in the same patient. To evaluate the relative enhancement of liver, pancreas, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), pancreas-to-liver index, and FNH-to-liver index in the hepatic arterial dominant phase (HADP) after injection of hepatocyte-specific MRI contrast agents, gadoxetic acid and gadobenate dimeglumine, on 3 and 1.5 Tesla (T) MRI in the same patient.The MRI database was retrospectively searched to identify consecutive patients who underwent abdominal MRI at 3T and 1.5T systems, using both 0.025 mmol/kg gadoxetic acid-enhanced and 0.05 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI at the same magnetic strength field system. 22 patients were identified, 10 were scanned at 3T system and 12 at 1.5T system. The enhancement of liver, pancreas, and FNH was evaluated quantitatively on MR images.The relative enhancement of liver in HADP in the gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced group in all subjects was significantly higher than that in gadoxetic acid-enhanced group (P = 0.023). The gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced group in HADP had better relative enhancement of pancreas and FNH, pancreas-to-liver index, and FNH-to-liver index than gadoxetic acid-enhanced group, but the difference was not statistically significant.The 0.05 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced abdominal MRI studies at 3T and 1.5T MR systems are superior in relative enhancement of the liver in HADP to 0.025 mmol/kg gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. This type of assessment may provide comparative effectiveness data.
