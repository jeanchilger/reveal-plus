Juxtapapillary diverticulum: findings on CT and MRI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of juxtapapillary diverticulum. CT and/or MRI examinations of 12 patients were evaluated. The size, location of the diverticula and imaging findings of associated pancreaticobiliary disease were assessed. On CT, oral contrast air level was the characteristic imaging feature. On MRI, T2-weighted images demonstrated the air fluid level with hyperintense fluid and signal void air level above. Associated imaging findings were dilated common bile duct (CBD), cholecystitis, cholecystolithiasis and chronic pancreatitis.
