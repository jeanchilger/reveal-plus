Hemorrhage from abdominal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated successfully by emergency transcatheter arterial embolization. A 49-year-old Japanese woman with follicular lymphoma who presented with severe abdominal and back pain is reported. She was known to have malignant lymphoma and had been previously treated with combination chemotherapy. An abdominal tumor occurring at the root of the mesentery and involving the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) had been diagnosed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and abdominal angiography. Emergent ultrasonography and CT findings showed intraperitoneal bleeding from the abdominal tumor. Selective SMA angiography revealed extravasation from a small branch originating from the dorsal pancreatic artery, which was embolized through a catheter by using platinum coils. It should be noted that a large tumor of malignant lymphoma, involving large vessels, may bleed, and in such a case selective transcatheter arterial embolization may be one of the effective modalities for hemostasis.
