Cystadenoma of the pancreas: the clinical and preoperative diagnostic problems. Pancreatic cystadenomas must be considered in the differential diagnosis of all cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. On the basis of a clinical observation, the authors discuss the most important clinical and diagnostic findings of pancreatic cystadenomas with special regard for what concerns the mucinous type. The authors underline the extreme difficulty of a correct preoperative diagnosis and discuss, after a wide literature review, the utility and the validity of the various imaging, cytological and immunohistochemical preoperative diagnostic procedures. In most cases the final diagnostic confirmation comes from the histology on the resected specimen therefore all cystic neoplasms, no matter their location within the gland, which are not clearly identified pre or intraoperatively, should be surgically treated and removed.
