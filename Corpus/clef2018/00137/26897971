Management of Islet Cell Tumours: A Single Hospital Experience. Islet cell tumours (ICTs) are uncommon tumours in clinical practice. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for ICTs, but localisation of these lesions can be challenging. The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical diagnosis and treatment for ICTs.Thirty-one patients with ICTs who were diagnosed and who underwent surgical treatment in the affiliate hospital of Luzhou Medical College from 1 January 2000 to 31 July 2013 were enrolled. The clinical data of these patients were retrospectively reviewed.Among 31 patients (6 males, 25 females), 15 cases (48.39%) had non-functional ICTs and 16 (51.61%) cases were insulinoma. The mean age of patients with non-functional ICTs was 42.73 ± 12.34 years and of those with insulinoma was 48.88 ± 13 years. Non-functional ICTs had a non-specific presentation. Insulinoma makes different clinical presentations mostly with symptoms of hypoglycaemia.Preoperative and/or intra-operative localisation is needed for ICTs CT scan or MRI is used routinely as the first choice. If the lesion is very small, DSA is also good for localisation before operation. IOUS is a reliable technique in exactly localising insulinoma. ICTs are considered to be cured with successful surgical removal.
