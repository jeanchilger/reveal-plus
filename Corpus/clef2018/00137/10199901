Adult diseases in children. The classic teaching in performance and interpretation of diagnostic studies is that "children are not small adults." The purpose of this article is to show a spectrum of "adult" disease entities that can occur, but are not usually considered in the pediatric population: cricopharyngeal achalasia, Schatzki's ring, achalasia, Helicobacter pylori, pancreatic carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of the colon, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, malignant melanoma, hydatidiform mole, renal cell carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma of the ovary and sarcoidosis. Radiologists interpreting pediatric imaging should recognize these entities and perform an appropriate diagnostic workup.
