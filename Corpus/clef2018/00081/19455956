Usefulness of FDG-PET for diagnosis of lung cancer associated with interstitial pneumonia. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of FDG-PET for diagnosis of lung cancer associated with interstitial pneumonia (IP), clinicopathologically.32 patients with IP-associated lung cancer (IP-LC group) and 26 patients with IP not associated with lung cancer (IP group) underwent 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for diagnostic procedure from April 2004 through October 2007. Standard uptake values (SUV) were compared between IP and lung cancer fields in two groups. In addition, expression of Glut-1, MIB-1, and p53 in the resected lung tissues (n=10) were analyzed.There was a significant difference in SUVs between lung cancer fields and IP fields. However, it was difficult to distinguish the fields of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma from IP by SUV. Red blood cells in the vessels along the alveolar walls, hyperplastic alveolar type II cells, and squamous metaplastic cells in the fibrotic lung tissues revealed expression of Glut-1. In addition, hyperplastic alveolar type II cells and metaplastic cells also revealed expression of MIB-1 and p53.The elevation of SUV in IP fields can be caused by neovascularization and/or hyperplasia of alveolar type II cells and metaplastic cells in the fibrotic lesions.
