Head and neck oncology--2010, Part I. This article reviewed the current state of the art in head and neck oncology. These include very important and stimulating new areas of interest including the marked acceptance of chemoradiation in favor of surgery in patients with cancer of the head and neck. The concept of HPV as a cause of cancer of the oropharynx is relatively new and very important in the epidemiology of these tumors. New modalities such as PET CT scanning and robotic surgery are discussed and appear to be very important in management of cancer of the head and neck. Endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery is another new high technology contribution to the field of head and neck surgery as is the use of endoscopic assisted thyroid surgery. These and other new concepts are discussed in this manuscript.
