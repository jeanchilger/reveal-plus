Early tumor response to Hsp90 therapy using HER2 PET: comparison with 18F-FDG PET. We compared (68)Ga-DOTA-F(ab')(2)-herceptin (DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid [HER2 PET]) and (18)F-FDG PET for imaging of tumor response to the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG).Mice bearing BT474 breast tumor xenografts were scanned with (18)F-FDG PET and HER2 PET before and after 17AAG treatment and then biweekly for up to 3 wk.Within 24 h after treatment, a significant decrease in HER2 was measured by HER2 PET, whereas (18)F-FDG PET uptake, a measure of glycolysis, was unchanged. Marked growth inhibition occurred in treated tumors but became evident only by 11 d after treatment. Thus, Her2 downregulation occurs independently of changes in glycolysis after 17AAG therapy, and Her2 reduction more accurately predicts subsequent tumor growth inhibition.HER2 PET is an earlier predictor of tumor response to 17AAG therapy than (18)F-FDG PET.
