Advantages and pitfalls of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in detecting locally residual or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging. This prospective study was designed to elucidate the advantages and pitfalls of (18)F-FDG PET in detecting locally residual/recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in comparison with MRI.We recruited NPC patients from two ongoing prospective trials. One is being performed to evaluate suspected local recurrence (group A) and the other to assess local treatment response 3 months after therapy (group B). Both groups received (18)F-FDG PET and head and neck MRI. The gold standard was histopathology or clinical/imaging follow-up. An optimal cut-off standardised uptake value (SUV) was retrospectively determined.From January 2002 to August 2004, 146 patients were eligible. Thirty-four were from group A and 112 from group B. In all, 26 had locally recurrent/residual tumours. Differences in detection rate between (18)F-FDG PET and MRI were not statistically significant in either group. However, (18)F-FDG PET showed significantly higher specificity than MRI in detecting residual tumours among patients with initial T4 disease (p=0.04). In contrast, the specificity of (18)F-FDG PET for patients with an initial T1-2 tumour treated with intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) was significantly lower than that for patients not treated by ICBT (72.2% vs 98.1%, p=0.003). At an SUV cut-off of 4.2, PET showed an equal and a higher accuracy compared with MRI in groups A and B, respectively.(18)F-FDG PET is superior to MRI in identifying locally residual NPC among patients with initial T4 disease but demonstrates limitations in assessing treatment response in patients with initial T1-2 disease after ICBT. A cut-off SUV is a useful index for aiding in the visual detection of locally residual/recurrent NPC.
