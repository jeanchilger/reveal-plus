Recurrent steroid-responsive pancreatitis associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and transformations. Several paraneoplastic inflammatory conditions, particularly autoimmune diseases, have been described in association with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, to date, recurrent acute pancreatitis has never been described in association with MDS. A 44-year-old man presented with prolonged fever and fatigue. Aortitis and pericarditis were diagnosed simultaneously with MDS, refractory anemia with excess blast type 2. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein were markedly elevated. The vasculitic syndrome responded rapidly to corticosteroids, but soon after tapering of corticosteroids, acute pancreatitis developed. Pain and pancreatic enzymes, however, improved rapidly with escalation of corticosteroid dosage. Multiple attempts at discontinuing the drug resulted in symptomatic flare-ups. Finally, his MDS transformed into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) severe acute pancreatitis closely accompanied. Induction chemotherapy and high-dose corticosteroids, however, controlled both conditions. A subsequent pancreatitis attack with pseudocyst formation occurred, but again was controlled with corticosteroids, although this was followed closely by another relapse of AML. All etiologies for recurrent acute pancreatitis were ruled out. The dramatic response of his pancreatitis attacks to immunosuppression suggested its autoimmune origin, while the close relationship in both the timing and severity of acute pancreatitis and MDS/AML suggested that the autoimmune pancreatitis was a paraneoplastic phenomenon related to MDS.
