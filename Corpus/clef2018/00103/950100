Acute intermittent porphyria with relapsing acute pancreatitis and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without overt hemolysis. A 36-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with a first attack of acute intermittent porphyria. At the same time increased serum levels of amylase and lipase as well as an increased amylase clearance to creatinine clearance ratio were observed, permitting the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The etiology of the latter could not be determined. In addition, elevation of indirect bilirubin without evidence of hemolysis was observed Gilbert's syndrome was suspected. 40 weeks after the first episode, a second attack of identical abdominal pain was noted, with elevation of pancreatic enzymes in the serum. There is evidence that acute intermittent porphyria and acute relapsing pancreatitis may have some etiological connection in this patient.
