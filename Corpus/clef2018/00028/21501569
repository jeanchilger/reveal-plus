Dual-modality monitoring of tumor response to cyclophosphamide therapy in mice with bioluminescence imaging and small-animal positron emission tomography. The purpose of this study was to noninvasively monitor the therapeutic efficacy of cyclophosphamide (CTX) in a mouse model by dual-modality molecular imaging: positron emission tomography (PET) and bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Firefly luciferase (fLuc) transfected HCC-LM3-fLuc human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice to establish the experimental tumor model. Two groups of HCC-LM3-fLuc tumor-bearing mice (n  =  7 per group) were treated with saline or CTX (100 mg/kg on days 0, 2, 5, and 7). BLI and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET scans were done to evaluate the treatment efficacy. CTX induced a 25.25 ± 13.13% and 35.91 ± 25.85% tumor growth inhibition rate on days 9 and 12 posttreatment, respectively, as determined by BLI. A good linear correlation was found between the tumor sizes measured by caliper and the BLI signals determined by optical imaging (R(2)  =  .9216). (18)F-FDG imaging revealed a significant uptake reduction in the tumors of the CTX-treated group compared to that in the saline control group (5.30 ± 1.97 vs 3.00 ± 2.11% ID/g) on day 16 after CTX treatment. Dual-modality molecular imaging using BLI and small-animal PET can play important roles in the process of chemotherapy and will provide noninvasive and reliable monitoring of the therapeutic response.
