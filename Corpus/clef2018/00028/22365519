Pulmonary metastasectomy for soft tissue sarcoma. The American Cancer Society predicts 10,520 new cases and 3920 deaths from soft tissue sarcoma (STS) for 2010. STS disseminates primarily via the hematogenous route, although lymphatic spread does occur with certain subtypes. The lung is the most common metastatic site in most large series, accounting for up to 80% of metastases. The median overall survival for pulmonary metastatic disease with current multidisciplinary treatment is approximately 12 to 14 months. Pulmonary metastasectomy (PM) represents the only potentially curative treatment for patients with STS and lung metastases. This article discusses the management of STS using PM.
