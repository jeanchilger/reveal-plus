Comparison of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and carbon-11-methionine PET in detection of malignant tumors. Two commonly used tumor-seeking agents for PET are 2-deoxy-2-18F-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) and L-methyl-11C-methionine (Met). This study compared FDG and Met in detecting residual or recurrent malignant tumors in the same patients.Thirty-four lesions in 24 patients with clinically suspected recurrent or residual tumors were studied with PET using Met as well as FDG. FDG scans were conducted 1 hr after the completion of PET with Met. The color-coded superimposed images of standardized uptake values (SUVs) and transmission data were produced, and the peak SUVs in the lesions were then evaluated. Lesions above 2.5 SUV were interpreted as positive results for active tumor.The sensitivity of FDG-PET and Met-PET were 64.5% (20/31 lesions) and 61.3% (19/31 lesions), respectively. The mean SUV of FDG in residual or recurrent malignant tumors (n = 31) was significantly higher than that of Met but there was a significant correlation (r = 0.788, p < 0.01) between FDG and Met SUVs in all lesions (n = 34).PET using FDG and Met appear equally effective in detecting residual or recurrent malignant tumors although FDG uptakes were slightly higher than Met uptakes. Both showed a limited diagnostic sensitivity for small (< 1.5 cm) tumors.
