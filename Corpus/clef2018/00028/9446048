Additional studies in the assessment of brain concussion. Following minor head traumas nervous system injuries develop at cellular level. In these cases only multidirectional analysis using various techniques can contribute to easier detection of focal lesions. The importance of neurophysiological methods, including electroencephalography (EEG), polysomnography, neuroimaging methods, such as cerebral tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MRI), single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) in cases of minor head trauma. A brief review of the diagnostic methods applicable in the assessment of brain commotion shows that the dynamic development of new diagnostic techniques such as SPECT and MRI made possible a better insight into the processes taking place after minor trauma to the head. Together with traditional methods it can contribute to more objective demonstration of the symptoms, dynamics of the pathological process and more exact expertise of late sequelae of the trauma.
