What has positron emission tomography told us about the epileptogenic zone? There is no one ligand for visualising "the epileptogenic zone". Several PET ligands, however, can help by noninvasively or minimally invasively refining hypotheses regarding its location. Their relative merits depend not only on local availability and expertise, but also on epilepsy syndrome and overall diagnostic category. FDG, flumazenil (FMZ), alpha-methyl-tryptophan (AMT), the 5-HT1A ligands, and diprenorphine are discussed.
