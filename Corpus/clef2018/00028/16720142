Clinical usefulness of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the management of patients with nonpancreatic periampullary neoplasms. 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18-FDG PET) has been investigated for the diagnosis and staging of gastrointestinal malignancies including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical usefulness of 18-FDG PET in the diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of patients with periampullary neoplasms.Twenty-five patients underwent whole-body 18-FDG PET and abdominal computed tomography (CT). Pathologic confirmation was obtained in all patients by surgical resection or biopsy examination. The 18-FDG PET was analyzed visually and semiquantitatively using the standard uptake value (SUV). Positivity was assumed when a focal uptake occurred with an SUV of 2.5 or greater.Between January 1998 and December 2003, 14 ampullary, 7 bile duct, and 4 duodenal tumors were included in the study. PET showed increased focal uptake in 22 patients (88%): 11 of 14 (79%) ampullary tumors, and 100% of bile duct and duodenal tumors. PET showed a focal uptake in 11 of 12 patients without detectable mass at CT scan, and lymph node metastases in 6 patients. An SUV value of 2.7 discriminated adenomas or noninvasive cancers (n = 6) from invasive malignancies (n = 14). Follow-up evaluation including CT scan and PET was performed in 12 patients: PET showed recurrent disease not seen by CT in 4 patients, confirmed CT findings in 6 patients, and showed an unsuspected primary lung cancer in 1 patient and colon cancer in another patient.18-FDG PET is very sensitive for detecting periampullary neoplasms. It may be useful to differentiate benign or borderline lesions from invasive tumors when no mass has been identified by traditional imaging. Finally, it is very useful in the follow-up evaluation of resected patients to identify recurrent disease or other malignancies.
