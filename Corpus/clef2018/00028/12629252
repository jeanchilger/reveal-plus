Peri-ictal water drinking lateralizes seizure onset to the nondominant temporal lobe. The authors describe seven patients with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy whose seizures were associated with peri-ictal water drinking behavior. Presurgical evaluation, including video-EEG monitoring, MRI, SPECT, and neuropsychological testing, revealed a seizure onset in the nondominant temporal lobe. All patients had an excellent outcome after epilepsy surgery. Peri-ictal water drinking may represent a lateralizing sign indicating seizure onset in the nondominant temporal lobe.
