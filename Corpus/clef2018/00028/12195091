Determination of the prognostic value of [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by using positron emission tomography in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The aim of this study was to determine whether quantitative information obtained from [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) has a prognostic significance for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated (18)F-FDG PET imaging of 73 patients with NSCLC. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) was significantly different between the histopathological types of tumour (squamous cell carcinoma (n=37, 12.4+/-5.1), adenocarcinoma (n=30, 8.2+/-5.8), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (n=4, 2.6+/-1.7), <0.01). In the univariate analysis of all patients, staging (P=0.0001), tumour cell type (P=0.013), and a SUV(max) greater than 7 (P=0.0011) was correlated with survival. However, a multivariate analysis identified staging and SUV(max) greater than 7 were affected survival adversely. The mortality rate of patients with group I disease (stage I to stage IIIA) was 5.8 times lower than that of patients with group II disease (stage IIIB to stage IV). Patients with a high SUV(max) (> or =7) had a 6.3 times higher mortality than those with a low SUV(max)(<7). By multivariate analysis of patients with squamous cell carcinoma, only grouping affected survival (P=0.008, relative risk=4.3). In the case of adenocarcinoma, the SUV(max) (>10) correlated exclusively with poorer survival (P=0.031, relative risk=11.152). (18)F-FDG uptake correlated with survival in NSCLC. Especially in adenocarcinomas, the SUV(max) was complementary to other known prognostic factors.
