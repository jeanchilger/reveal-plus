Differential computed tomographic attenuation of metabolically active and inactive adipose tissues: preliminary findings. This study investigates differences in computed tomography Hounsfield units between metabolically active (brown fat) and inactive adipose tissues (white fat) due to variations in their densities. Positron emission and computed tomographic data from 101 pediatric and adolescent patients were analyzed. Regions of metabolically active and inactive adipose tissues were identified, and standard uptake values and Hounsfield units were measured. Hounsfield units of active brown fat were more positive (P < 0.001) than inactive fat (-62.4 ± 5.3 vs -86.7 ± 7.0) and the difference was observed in both males and females.
