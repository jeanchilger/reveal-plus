Comparative evaluation of cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow in acute ischemic stroke by using perfusion-weighted MR imaging and SPECT. To investigate the relationship between relative cerebral blood volume (CBV) measured with perfusion-weighted (PW) MR imaging and relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured with SPECT in acute ischemic stroke.Fifteen patients who had acute unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion underwent both PW MR imaging and 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT with an interval less than 20 min between the two examinations within 6 h after stroke onset. Lesion-to-contralateral relative CBV and CBF ratios measured in multiple regions of interest were compared to evaluate the relationship of the two parameters.An overall linear relationship was found between relative CBV and relative CBF ratios (R2 = 0.54, p < 0.0001). The two parameters correlated linearly to each other in regions with evolving infarction (R2 = 0.43, p<0.0001), but not in regions without evolving infarction (R2 = 0.001, p>0.05). Regions with evolving infarction had more severe hypoperfusion (mean relative CBF ratio, 0.38 +/- 0.22) than regions without (mean relative CBF ratio, 0.70+/-0.13) (p<0.0001).A significant linear relationship existed between relative CBV and relative CBF in acute ischemic stroke, although relative CBV did not change linearly to relative CBF in mild hypoperfusion. Relative CBV can be used as an alternative to relative CBF within 6 h after stroke onset, particularly in regions with severe hypoperfusion proceeding to infarction.
