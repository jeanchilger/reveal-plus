Radiologic evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule. The radiologic evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules can be a complex process. Modalities, which can be used, include the chest radiograph, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography scanning. Interventional radiology can also play a role with image-guided transthoracic needle aspiration of indeterminate pulmonary nodules. The primary role of radiologic evaluation is to try to differentiate benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. The imaging findings that can be helpful in making this distinction as well as the limitations of each of the modalities are discussed. For the purpose of this review, solitary pulmonary nodule mimics such as skin or rib lesions, vascular malformations, and areas of rounded atelectasis are not discussed.
