Prognostic implication of (18)F FDG-PET in patients with extrahepatic metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing systemic treatment, a retrospective cohort study. The role of (18)F FDG-PET in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been firmly established. We conducted this study to investigate the clinical implication of SUVmax on (18)F FDG-PET as a prognostic factor in patients with HCC, especially in the metastatic setting.HCC patients with extrahepatic metastatic lesions were enrolled that were evaluated by (18)F FDG-PET before palliative systemic therapy, between January 2002 and December 2009 at the Seoul National University Hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcome and the value of the SUVmax.A total of 25 patients (men, 88.0%) were enrolled. The response rate and disease control rate was 18.2% (95% CI: 2.1-34.3) and 32.0% (95% CI: 16.3-56.5), respectively. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.3 months (95% CI: 1.1-3.4) and 14.2 months (95% CI: 9.1-19.2), respectively. The univariate analysis of OS showed that SUVmax and alphafetoprotein (AFP) were significant prognostic factors (P = 0.023 and P = 0.006, respectively). The multivariate analysis of OS showed that SUVmax and AFP were significant prognostic factors (P = 0.008 and P = 0.006, respectively). SUVmax and AFP were independent prognostic factors for PFS, too (P = 0.010 and P = 0.016, respectively). When the patients were divided according to the SUVmax and AFP, the patients with an SUVmax < 4.9 and an AFP ≤ 400 ng/ml showed longer OS and PFS than the patients with SUVmax ≥ 4.9 or AFP > 400 ng/ml (26.7 months vs. 9.3 months, P < 0.001 and 5.6 months vs. 1.7 months, P = 0.012, respectively).The SUVmax of the (18)F FDG-PET has a prognostic value for OS and PFS in patients with metastatic HCC undergoing systemic therapy. The combined analysis of the SUVmax with AFP might provide more detailed prognostic information.
