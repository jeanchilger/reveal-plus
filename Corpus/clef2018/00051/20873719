Design, synthesis, radiolabeling, and in vivo evaluation of carbon-11 labeled N-[2-[4-(3-cyanopyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-3-methoxybenzamide, a potential positron emission tomography tracer for the dopamine D(4) receptors. Here we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of physicochemical and pharmacological properties of D(4) dopamine receptor ligands related to N-[2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-3-methoxybenzamide (2). Structural features were incorporated to increase affinity for the target receptor, to improve selectivity over D(2) and σ(1) receptors, to enable labeling with carbon-11 or fluorine-18, and to adjust lipophilicity within the range considered optimal for brain penetration and low nonspecific binding. Compounds 7 and 13 showed the overall best characteristics: nanomolar affinity for the D(4) receptor, >100-fold selectivity over D(2) and D(3) dopamine receptors, 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A), and 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptors and σ(1) receptors, and log P = 2.37-2.55. Following intraperitoneal administration in mice, both compounds rapidly entered the central nervous system. The methoxy of N-[2-[4-(3-cyanopyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-3-methoxybenzamide (7) was radiolabeled with carbon-11 and subjected to PET analysis in non-human primate. [(11)C]7 time-dependently accumulated to saturation in the posterior eye in the region of the retina, a tissue containing a high density of D(4) receptors.
