C-MOPP: the forgotten regimen plus Rituximab for untreated and relapsed follicular lymphoma. C-MOPP is a chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Because rituximab improves results in B-cell NHL, we added rituximab to C-MOPP, giving it the term C-MOPP-R. We retrospectively report the results of C-MOPP-R treatment for follicular lymphoma at Saint Louis University Cancer Center from 2000-2009. Treatment response was assessed with fusion PET/CT using International Harmonization Project Criteria and toxicity using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Thirty-seven patients with follicular lymphoma were treated at our institution with C-MOPP-R. The complete response rate was ninety-four percent and sixty-eight percent in untreated and relapsed patients, respectively. The median progression-free and overall survivals were not reached with median observation time of 34 months. Development of peripheral neuropathy required truncation of planned vincristine dosing in nearly half of patients. We believe that C-MOPP-R results in excellent response rates, progression-free, and overall survival for untreated and relapsed follicular lymphoma and capped vincristine dosing is essential to optimize safety.
