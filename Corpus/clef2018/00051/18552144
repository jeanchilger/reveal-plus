Monitoring the efficacy of adoptively transferred prostate cancer-targeted human T lymphocytes with PET and bioluminescence imaging. Noninvasive imaging technologies have the potential to enhance the monitoring and improvement of adoptive therapy with tumor-targeted T lymphocytes. We established an imaging methodology for the assessment of spatial and temporal distributions of adoptively transferred genetically modified human T cells in vivo for treatment monitoring and prediction of tumor response in a systemic prostate cancer model.RM1 murine prostate carcinoma tumors transduced with human prostate-specific membrane antigen (hPSMA) and a Renilla luciferase reporter gene were established in SCID/beige mice. Human T lymphocytes were transduced with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) specific for either hPSMA or human carcinoembryonic antigen (hCEA) and with a fusion reporter gene for herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1tk) and green fluorescent protein, with or without click beetle red luciferase. The localization of adoptively transferred T cells in tumor-bearing mice was monitored with 2'-(18)F-fluoro-2'-deoxy-1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-ethyluracil ((18)F-FEAU) small-animal PET and bioluminescence imaging (BLI).Cotransduction of CAR-expressing T cells with the reporter gene did not affect CAR-mediated cytotoxicity. BLI of Renilla and click beetle red luciferase expression enabled concurrent imaging of adoptively transferred T cells and systemic tumors in the same animal. hPSMA-specific T lymphocytes persisted longer than control hCEA-targeted T cells in lung hPSMA-positive tumors, as indicated by both PET and BLI. Precise quantification of T-cell distributions at tumor sites by PET revealed that delayed tumor progression was positively correlated with the levels of (18)F-FEAU accumulation in tumor foci in treated animals.Quantitative noninvasive monitoring of genetically engineered human T lymphocytes by PET provides spatial and temporal information on T-cell trafficking and persistence. PET may be useful for predicting tumor response and for guiding adoptive T-cell therapy.
