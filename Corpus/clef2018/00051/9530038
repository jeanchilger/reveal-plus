Localized form of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: FDG PET findings. The aim of our study was to describe 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) findings of a localized form of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and to compare those findings with other cell types of lung cancer.FDG PET was performed in 48 patients with lung cancer. The patients had carcinomas of various cell types: bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (n = 9), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11), adenocarcinoma (n = 22), and other cell types (n = 6). Using FDG PET, we compared peak standardized uptake values among the various cell types of lung cancer. CT and pathologic findings for patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma were also reviewed.Overall, 48 malignant tumors showed a mean peak standardized uptake value of 8.0 +/- 4.1. The mean peak standardized uptake value was 3.5 +/- 2.2 for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, 10.8 +/- 4.4 for squamous cell carcinoma, and 8.8 +/- 3.2 for adenocarcinoma. The mean peak standardized uptake value for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma was significantly lower than that for adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (p < .001). On high-resolution CT scans, bronchioloalveolar carcinomas appeared as areas of ground-glass opacity (n = 4), as nodules (n = 2), as masses (n = 2), and as a ground-glass opacity plus consolidation (n = 1). On pathologic examination, bronchioloalveolar carcinomas were well differentiated, having moderate degrees of nuclear atypism, mild degrees of mitotic figure, desmoplasia, and necrosis.The localized form of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma shows significantly lower peak standardized uptake values than do other lung carcinomas. Thus, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma can be a potential cause of false-negative findings of malignancy on FDG PET scans. When bronchioloalveolar carcinoma is suggested, FDG PET results should be interpreted in combination with high-resolution CT findings.
