Neuroimaging in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with central nervous system (CNS) changes that may affect cerebral blood flow (CBF), metabolism, structure, and diffusion. Each of the available neuroimaging techniques offers unique insight into the neural mechanisms underlying HIV, as well as a potential means of monitoring disease progression and treatment response. The purpose of the article is to provide a review of experimental studies evaluating changes related to HIV with imaging techniques, including single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and perfusion MRI (pMRI).
