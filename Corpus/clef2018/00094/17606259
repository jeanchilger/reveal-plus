High-normal fasting blood glucose in non-diabetic range is associated with increased coronary artery calcium burden in asymptomatic men. : The objective of the study is to evaluate whether high fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the non-diabetic range (<126 mg/dl) is associated with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis as determined by coronary artery calcium (CAC) independent of clustering of metabolic syndrome (MS) risk factors.: Previously non-diabetic, 458 asymptomatic non-diabetic Brazilian men (mean age: 46+/-7 years, range: 29-65) underwent clinical consultation including FBG measurements and electron-beam tomography (EBT). The mean FBG of the study population was 88+/-10mg/dl. Overall, 190 (42%) of men had CAC>0. The prevalence of CAC was significantly higher among men with high-normal FBG (4th quartile: 94-125 mg/dl) versus normal FBG group (lower three quartiles: 66-93 mg/dl) (62% versus 35%, p<0.0001). In age adjusted analyses the odds ratio (OR) for any CAC among men with high-normal FBG versus normal FBG was 2.19 (95% CI: 1.33-3.58). On further adjustment for risk factors the relationship was slightly attenuated, however remained statistically significant (OR=1.78, 95% CI 1.05-3.00, p=0.03). In sub-stratified analyses high-normal FBG was associated with CAC among men without MS (OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.04-3.78) and with MS (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 0.95-4.80). Similar relations with high-normal FBG were observed among individuals classified low risk (OR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.14-4.83) as well intermediate high-risk men (OR: 1.95, 95% CI: 0.99-3.86) by Framingham risk score (FRS), respectively.: Fasting blood glucose in the upper normal range appears to be associated with the presence of CAC in apparently non-diabetic Brazilian men.
