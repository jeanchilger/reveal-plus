Accessing the aortopulmonary window (#5) and the paraaortic (#6) lymph nodes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of the different techniques of lymph node biopsies in patients with suspected metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the subaortic (station #5) and paraaortic (station #6) lymph nodes.This was a retrospective cohort study conducted of a prospective database of patients between January 2003 and June 2006 with suspected N2 disease only in the #5 or #6 lymph nodes, or both. All patients had integrated 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and nodal biopsy or thoracotomy, or both, with complete thoracic lymphadenectomy.There were 112 patients with clinically suspected N2 disease in lymph node stations #5 or #6, or both. The primary tumor was in the left upper lobe in 98 (88%) and in the left lower lobe in 14 (13%), and 58 had pathologic N2 disease in #5 or #6 lymph node stations only. Mediastinoscopy, used in all patients found, unsuspected N3 disease in 4 patients (3.6%) and N2 (#4L) disease in 12 (11%). Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), implemented in 62 patients (56%), correctly identified 41 patients (66%). Left single-incision video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) was used in 39 patients and was correct in 100%. Of the 58 patients, 53 (91%) completed neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, followed by resection, and their 5-year survival was 64%.EUS-FNA is less accurate for the #5 and #6 lymph node stations than left VATS. We prefer left VATS over the Chamberlain procedure for patients with suspected nodal metastases isolated only to #5 or #6 stations, and if positive, we prefer neoadjuvant therapy. The advantage of neoadjuvant therapy followed by resection compared with resection followed by adjuvant therapy remains controversial and hence, the role for biopsy of these nodes is also controversial.
