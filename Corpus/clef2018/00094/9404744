Lung volume reduction surgery alters management of pulmonary nodules in patients with severe COPD. To examine the role of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) in expanding the treatment options for patients with single pulmonary nodules and emphysema.Retrospective review of all patients undergoing LVRS at the University of Michigan between January 1995 and June 1996. Those undergoing simultaneous LVRS and resection of a suspected pulmonary malignancy formed the study group and underwent history and physical examination, pulmonary function tests, chest radiography, and high-resolution CT of the chest. If heterogeneous emphysema was found, cardiac imaging and single-photon emission CT perfusion lung scanning were performed. All study patients participated in pulmonary rehabilitation preoperatively. Age- and sex-matched patients who had undergone standard lobectomy for removal of pulmonary malignancy during the same period formed the control group.Of 75 patients who underwent LVRS, 11 had simultaneous resection of a pulmonary nodule. In 10 patients, the nodules were radiographically apparent with 1 demonstrating central calcification. Histologic evaluation revealed six granulomas, two hamartomas, and three neoplastic lesions (one adenocarcinoma, one squamous cell, and one large cell carcinoma). Preoperative FEV1 was 26.18+/-2.49% predicted in the LVRS group and 81.36+/-6.07% predicted (p=0.000001) in the control group, and the FVC was 65.27+/-5.17% predicted vs 92.18+/-5.53% predicted (p=0.002). Two LVRS patients had a PaCO2 >45 mm Hg while 11 exhibited oxygen desaturation during a 6-min walk test. Postoperative complications occurred in two LVRS patients and three control patients. The mean length of stay in the LVRS group (7.55+/-1.10 days) was not different than in the control group (8.81+/-1.56 days). Three months after LVRS and simultaneous nodule resection, FEV1 rose by 47%, FVC by 25%, and all study patients noted less dyspnea as measured by transitional dyspnea index.Simultaneous LVRS and resection of a suspected bronchogenic carcinoma is feasible and associated with minimal morbidity and significantly improved pulmonary function and dyspnea.
