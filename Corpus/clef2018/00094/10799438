Neuroimaging in child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging in child psychiatry is a rapidly developing field and the number of different techniques being used is increasing rapidly. This review describes the current status of neuroimaging in childhood psychopathology and discusses limitations of the various studies. As yet, no specific and consistent abnormality has been detected in childhood psychiatric disorders. Obsessive compulsive disorder has shown the most consistent findings so far, with orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus being implicated. Better understanding of the corticostriatal neural networks will shed more light on the neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood.
