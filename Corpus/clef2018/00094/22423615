Phase II study of helical tomotherapy in the multidisciplinary treatment of oligometastatic colorectal cancer. Complete metastasectomy provides a real chance for long-term survival in patients with oligometastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). For inoperable patients, we evaluated in this study intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy (IMRT-IGRT) by helical tomotherapy.Twenty-four CRC patients with ≤ 5 metastases were enrolled, receiving a dose of 50 Gy in fractions of 5 Gy. No limitations concerning dimension or localization of the metastases were imposed. Whole body PET-CT was performed at baseline and 3 months after the initiation of RT to evaluate the metabolic response rate according to PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) version 1.0.A total of 53 metastases were treated. Seventeen patients (71%) received previously ≥ 1 line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease, displaying residual (n = 7) or progressive (n = 10) metabolic active oligometastatic disease at time of inclusion. Most common sites were the lung, liver and lymphnodes. One patient (4%) experienced grade 3 dysphagia. Twenty-two patients were evaluated by post-treatment PET-CT. Twelve patients achieved a complete (n = 6) or partial (n = 6) metabolic response, resulting in an overall metabolic response rate of 55%. At a median follow-up of 10 months, 7 patients (29%) are in remission, of which 5 received previous chemotherapy with residual oligometastatic disease at time of inclusion. The actuarial 1-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 54%, 14% and 78%.Helical tomotherapy delivering 10 fractions of 5 Gy resulted in a metabolic response rate of 55%, and appeared to be attractive as consolidation of inoperable oligometastatic disease after effective chemotherapy.Eudract 2008-008300-40 NCT00807313.
