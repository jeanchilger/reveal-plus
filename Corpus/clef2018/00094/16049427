Quantitative evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with moyamoya disease by dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging--comparison with positron emission tomography. We examined whether the degree of hemodynamic stress in patients with chronic occlusive cerebral vascular disease can be quantitatively evaluated with the use of perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI). Thirty-six patients with moyamoya disease (mean age, 26.8 years range, 18 to 59) underwent PWI and positron emission tomography (PET) within a month's interval. The PWI data were calculated by three different analytic methods. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) ratio, cerebral blood volume (CBV) ratio, and mean transit time (MTT) of the anterior circulation were calculated using the cerebellum as a control region and compared with PET data on the same three parameters and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF). Parametric maps of PWI attained a higher resolution than the PET maps and revealed focal perfusion failure on a gyrus-by-gyrus level. The relative CBV and MTT obtained with PWI showed significant linear correlations with the corresponding PET values (CBV, R2 = 0.47 to 0.58
