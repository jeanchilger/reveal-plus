Informatics in radiology (infoRAD): navigating the fifth dimension: innovative interface for multidimensional multimodality image navigation. The display and interpretation of images obtained by combining three-dimensional data acquired with two different modalities (eg, positron emission tomography and computed tomography) in the same subject require complex software tools that allow the user to adjust the image parameters. With the current fast imaging systems, it is possible to acquire dynamic images of the beating heart, which add a fourth dimension of visual information-the temporal dimension. Moreover, images acquired at different points during the transit of a contrast agent or during different functional phases add a fifth dimension-functional data. To facilitate real-time image navigation in the resultant large multidimensional image data sets, the authors developed a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine-compliant software program. The open-source software, called OsiriX, allows the user to navigate through multidimensional image series while adjusting the blending of images from different modalities, image contrast and intensity, and the rate of cine display of dynamic images.
