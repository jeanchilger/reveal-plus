Altered large-ring cyclodextrin product profile due to a mutation at Tyr-172 in the amylomaltase of Corynebacterium glutamicum. Corynebacterium glutamicum amylomaltase (CgAM) catalyzes the formation of large-ring cyclodextrins (LR-CDs) with a degree of polymerization of 19 and higher. The cloned CgAM gene was ligated into the pET-17b vector and used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Site-directed mutagenesis of Tyr-172 in CgAM to alanine (Y172A) was performed to determine its role in the control of LR-CD production. Both the recombinant wild-type (WT) and Y172A enzymes were purified to apparent homogeneity and characterized. The Y172A enzyme exhibited lower disproportionation, cyclization, and hydrolysis activities than the WT. The k(cat)/K(m) of the disproportionation reaction of the Y172A enzyme was 2.8-fold lower than that of the WT enzyme. The LR-CD product profile from enzyme catalysis depended on the incubation time and the enzyme concentration. Interestingly, the Y172A enzyme showed a product pattern different from that of the WT CgAM at a long incubation time. The principal LR-CD products of the Y172A mutated enzyme were a cycloamylose mixture with a degree of polymerization of 28 or 29 (CD28 or CD29), while the principal LR-CD product of the WT enzyme was CD25 at 0.05 U of amylomaltase. These results suggest that Tyr-172 plays an important role in determining the LR-CD product profile of this novel CgAM.
