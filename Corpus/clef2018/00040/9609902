Untreated primary lung and breast cancers: correlation between F-18 FDG kinetic rate constants and findings of in vitro studies. To compare kinetic modeling of 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-18 FDG) between untreated primary lung and untreated primary breast cancers by using positron emission tomographic (PET) findings and to correlate these findings with findings of in vitro studies.Nineteen patients (12 men, seven women age range, 49-82 years) with untreated primary lung cancer and 17 women with untreated primary breast cancer (age range, 26-65 years) underwent 1-hour dynamic F-18 FDG PET. A three-compartment model was applied to F-18 FDG kinetics in tumors. The standard uptake value normalized for lean body mass (SUVlean) in tumors was measured 50-60 minutes after tracer injection. In vitro, thin-layer chromatography was performed to evaluate the intracellular phosphorylation of tritiated F-18 FDG in human lung cancer and breast cancer cell lines.At PET, lung cancer had a significantly (P < .003) higher rate constant for F-18 FDG phosphorylation (k3) and SUVlean than did breast cancer (0.164 +/- 0.150 [standard deviation] vs 0.043 +/- 0.018 and 8.25 +/- 3.28 vs 3.17 +/- 1.08, respectively). Breast cancer showed a significant correlation between k3 and SUVlean (r = .607, P < .01), although no such correlation was observed in lung cancer. In vitro studies showed phosphorylation of F-18 FDG in breast cancer cells was less complete in hyperglycemia than it was in lung cancer cells.A much lower k3 appears to be a rate-limiting factor for F-18 FDG accumulation in breast cancer, while the higher k3 in lung cancer is probably not rate limiting for F-18 FDG accumulation.
