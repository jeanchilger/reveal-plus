Positron emission tomography in thoracic radiography. The optimisation of the field of irradiation is the aim of the radiotherapist. Pet-Scan provides information revealing a better cartography of node involvement and allowing a better delineation of the tumour zone. In the follow-up of irradiated patients, PET-Scan provides information on the nature of residual lesions and a possible recurrence.
