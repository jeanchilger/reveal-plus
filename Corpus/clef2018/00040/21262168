Need of better preoperative staging of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer is one of the most frequent gynaecological cancers in Danish women. The staging of the cancer is done surgically in accordance with guidelines from the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. The method has proven insufficient and unsuitable because treatment is frequently decided during surgery and the final staging is done by the pathologist when examining the specimen. Too many patients are over- or under-treated and there is a high demand for new diagnostic tools for preoperative staging of endometrial cancer. We have reviewed recent literature on the subject.
