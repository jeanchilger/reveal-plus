Rapid detection of a molecular marker for chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria. A PCR-based technique using molecular beacons was developed to detect the chloroquine resistance-associated pfcrt K76T point mutation in Plasmodium falciparum. One hundred thirty African clinical isolates were tested by the new method in comparison with the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. This rapid and inexpensive genomic assay could expand the possibilities for monitoring chloroquine resistance.
