Complete remission of acute promyelocytic leukemia resisting all-trans retinoic acid of one case treated by tanshinone II A. A 30 years-old man was administrated with dizziness and fatigue for half month, and the big toe on his left foot got the prolonged bleeding of wound complicated with fever 7 days before the admission. The physical examination (PE) discovered that the case suffered from the anemic appearance, lower part tenderness of sternum, petechiae and purpura on skin of lower extremities, and with remaining not to be remarkable. The examination of blood routine showed WBC 2.3 x 10(9)/L, Hb 60/L, BPC 34 x 10(9)/L and blasts 0. 85. The bone marrow smear indicated markedly the hypercellularity, promyelocytes 89% and strongly positive myeloperoxidase (MPO). The PT and APTT were prolonged, and the FDP and D-dimer were positive. The acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with DIC was diagnosed. The patient was administered with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with dosage of 20 mg three times per day. After 14 week treatment, the patient did not get complete remission. Then the tanshinone II A was taken orally with 30mg twice each day. After 8 week treatment of tanshinone II A, the blood routine was restored to normal. Four weeks later, the bone marrow also became normally, and the patient got a complete remission (CR). After more than 3 months of consolidation therapy with tanshinone II A, the patient was relapsed. When the homoharringtonine and cytarabine (HA) were given, the patient was got CR again. Three years later, he was relapsed secondarily, and then died of intracranial hemorrhage. The tanshinone II A could induce CR of APL with ATRA resistance, no side effect was observed there is a reoccurring possibility from consolidation therapy with tanshinone II A.
