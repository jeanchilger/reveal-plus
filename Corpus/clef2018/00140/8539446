Primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma with multiple metastases: a case report. We report a rare case of primary hepatic neuroendocrine cell carcinoma with multiple metastases to the liver, lung, diaphragm, bone, and pancreas. The patient was a 45-year-old man with jaundice and a large hepatic tumor measuring 12 x 16 cm at autopsy. Located in the right lobe, it was hyperechoic and inhomogeneous on US, a diffusely low density mass that contained capsule- and septum-like structures enhanced by contrast medium on CT, an inhomogeneously low intensity mass with much lower intensity foci on T1-weighted MRI, and a diffusely high intensity mass containing small higher and lower intensity foci on T2-weighted MRI. These findings are similar to those of a few previously reported cases, but are not specific to this tumor.
