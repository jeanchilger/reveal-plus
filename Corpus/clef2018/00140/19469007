Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for the detection of pancreatic duct stones in patients with chronic pancreatitis. To assess the role of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in detection of pancreatic duct stones (PDS) in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP).Clinical data of 78 CP patients who were treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (China) between January 2004 and July 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. A predictive model of pancreatic duct stones was established through logistic regression and its effectiveness was verified. Among these patients, MRCP was performed in 60 patients who served as a control group, while 44 patients with a higher predictive value than the entry threshold of the predictive model served as an experimental group.The positive rate of PDS in the 78 patients with CP was 19.2% (15/78). The predictive entry threshold of the predictive model was 5% (P < 0.05). The possibility of existence of PDS could be predicted according to the following 4 indexes: gastrointestinal symptoms, intermittent abdominal pain, diabetes mellitus (DM)/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and positive B-mode ultrasound results. The incidence of PDS in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05).MRCP is strongly suggested for the detection of PDS in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, intermittent abdominal pain, DM/IGT and positive B-mode ultrasound results.
