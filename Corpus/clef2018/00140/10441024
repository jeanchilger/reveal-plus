Unexpected MR-T1 enhancement of endocrine liver metastases with mangafodipir. With the use of available liver magnetic resonance contrast agents, such as mangafodipir (Mn-DPDP), liver metastases do not exhibit enhancement on T1-weighted images. This absence of enhancement is due to the lack of hepatocytes within these tumors. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate an unexpected enhancement on T1-weighted images 30 minutes after injection of mangafodipir, in the case of endocrine liver metastases from a non-hyperfunctioning neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor. Different hypotheses could explain this unexpected enhancement, such as increased arterial tumoral flow or high metabolic activity. Contrary to liver metastases of other origins, Mn-DPDP enhancement can be present in neuroendocrine metastases. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 199910:193-195.
