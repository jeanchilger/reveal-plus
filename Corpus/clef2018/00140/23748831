A case report of a patient with advanced acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas: long-term survival with regional, systemic and targeted therapy. Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas is an uncommon malignancy for which there are no prospective, randomized data to guide therapy. We describe the clinical course and management of a patient with advanced pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma who is alive seven years after diagnosis using systemic and regional chemotherapies as well as molecularly targeted agents.
