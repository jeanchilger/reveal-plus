Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas. A case of lymphoepithelial cyst (LEC) of the pancreas is presented. A 48-year-old man complaining of general fatigue was found to have a heterogeneous water-dense mass protruding from the surface of the pancreas on plain computed tomography (CT). Dynamic CT disclosed septa within the mass. Magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI) showed a hypointense mass on T1-weighted imaging, and a hyperintense mass on T2-weighted imaging. MRI with gadolinium enhancement revealed septa within the mass. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed septa and fine echogenic structures within the cystic echoic lesion. Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography showed a normal duct system. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed, with a suspected diagnosis of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Histopathologic examination disclosed LEC of the pancreas. Our case suggests that LEC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.
