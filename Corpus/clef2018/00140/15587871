Diagnostic imaging in a case of a cystic lesion of the pancreas. The case of a patient admitted to hospital for symptoms characterized by upper abdominal pain of pancreatic type associated with vomiting, is discussed. MRI was performed. It documented a focal fluid lesion apparently in communication with the dilated main pancreatic duct showing filling defects. Based on previous radiologic examinations performed elsewhere and MRI findings the diagnostic suspicion was of a cystic lesion. MRI was performed again for re-evaluation and lithotripsy was done the patient was discharged with the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis from alcohol abuse.
