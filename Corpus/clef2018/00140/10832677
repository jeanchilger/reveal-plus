Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas with sebaceous differentiation. We recently encountered a patient with a lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas with sebaceous differentiation. We sought to compare the characteristics of this patient with those previously reported in order to foster a keener understanding of this rare clinical entity. After reviewing the present patient's case in detail, we conducted a comprehensive review of the English-language literature and analyzed the clinical characteristics of reported cases of lymphoepithelial cysts. Our patient was an asymptomatic 60-year-old man who presented with an incidental finding of a cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas documented by computed tomography. The cyst was enucleated, and was found to contain keratinized material. It was lined by squamous epithelium with small sebaceous glands, and surrounded by lymphoid tissue with germinal centers. Of 33 reported cases, only 6 (18%) contained sebaceous glands. In all patients who underwent operation, the cysts were easily resected, and the outcome was favorable. Lymphoepithelial cyst of the pancreas is rare, and may be difficult to differentiate from cystic neoplasms preoperatively. Therefore resection is indicated. The diagnosis, however, can be confirmed by careful histologic review, and the prognosis is excellent.
