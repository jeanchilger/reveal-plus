The incidental cystic pancreas mass: a practical approach. Technical advances in cross-sectional imaging have led to the discovery of incidental cystic pancreatic lesions in the oncology and non-oncology population that in the past remained undetected. These lesions have created a diagnostic and management dilemma for both clinicians and radiologists: should these lesions be ignored, watched, aspirated, or removed? In this review, recommendations concerning the assessment of the more common pancreatic cystic incidental lesions are presented.
