Disappearance of globus pallidus hyperintensity in a patient with portal-systemic encephalopathy after occlusion of the shunt vessel. A 67-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with confusion and asterixis on January 23, 1994. She had had the same symptoms repeatedly. On admission she was disorientated, and had slurred speech and asterixis. Laboratory data showed hyperammonemia (84 micrograms/dl) with a poor ICG hepatic clearance (ICG15min = 32%), although hepatic failure did not exist. Abdominal ultrasonography, CT scan and liver biopsy showed no evidence of cirrhosis. Celiac arteriography revealed a large shunt vessel connecting the portal vein to the left renal vein. A 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a bilateral and symmetrical hyperintensity of the globus pallidus in the T1-weighted images. Portal-systemic encephalopathy recurred repeatedly in spite of the conservative therapy, and there was no evidence of the portal hypertension. Therefore, the operative procedure of ligation of the shunt vessel was done on February 21, 1995. After the operation, blood ammonia level and ICG hepatic clearance were normalized. She became free from encephalopathy. Twenty-seven months after the operation, the hyperintensity of the globus pallidus in the T1-weighted images completely disappeared. There have been several reports describing that the globus pallidus alterations on the T1-weighted images in patients with liver cirrhosis, manganese intoxication and portal-systemic encephalopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first case that the hyperintense signal of the basal ganglia in a patient with portal-systemic encephalopathy disappeared completely after occlusion of the shunt vessel.
