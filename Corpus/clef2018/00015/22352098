Corelation of serum alpha fetoprotein and tumor size in hepatocellular carcinoma. To determine the correlation of elevated serum Alpha feto-protein with tumour size in hepatocellular carcinoma.A cross-sectional analytical study was done at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Medical Unit-III, Ward-7 from January 2009 to June 2010. Patients enrolled in study were known cases of chronic liver disease and were complicated by development of hepatocellular carcinoma those having metastasis in liver from any where were excluded. Demographic data such as age, gender, residence, were recorded. Detailed clinical history and examination were carried out and recorded in a preformed Performa. Complete blood count, liver function test, total protein, Albumin/Globulin (A/G) ratio, serum Albumin, HBsAg, anti HCV, alpha fetoprotein, ultrasound guided liver biopsy, ultrasound whole abdomen and/or CTscan Abdomen for size and number of tumour were also done. On the basis of alfa fetoprotein level patients were divided in to 3 groupsReview of the clinical data of 98 patients male 69 (70.4%) and female were 29 (29.6%) with mean age of 53.89 +/- 12.511 ranging from 32 to 82 years was done. Of these there were 22 (22.4%), 25 (25.5%), 51(52%) cases in group 1, 2, 3 respectively. While in tumour size groups, 17 (17.3%) were in group A, 35 (35.7%) in group B and 46 (46.9%) in group C. There was a significant correlation of serum AFP level with tumour size in hepatocellular carcinoma. (r=0.472, 0.0001).Our study suggests that serum AFP has significant correlation with the size of tumour. AFP level may serve as a useful marker for detection of Hepatocellular carcinoma and to differentiate between early and advance stage. On the basis of this proper treatment strategy can be planned.
