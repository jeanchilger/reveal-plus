New aspects in sonography of the liver. Ultrasound-based technologies are competing more and more success-fully against computerized tomography and magnetic resonance based imaging procedures. This thanks to technological improvements as well as accumulating evidence, stemming from properly conducted controlled clinical studies. The reduced cost and radiation safety issues are additional arguments in its favor. This article reviews new developments in ultrasound medicine as applied to the liver. Emphasis lies on new data related to contrast-ultrasound (Sulphur Hexafluoride SonoVue®) which allows a dynamic analysis of liver perfusion and hence improved characterization of focal liver lesions, such as metastases of extrahepatic tumors, regenerative nodules in patients with liver cirrhosis, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver hemangioma, liver adenoma and or focal hypo-respectively hypersteatosis. This article also deals with important new techniques, which allow assessment of liver stiffness such as transient elastography (Fibroscan), ARFI (Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse) or real-time-tissue elastography. These new techniques will help us to assess and quantify the levels of liver steatosis with more precision and permit accurate follow-up measurements.
