Hepatocellular carcinoma: diagnosis, staging, and treatment strategy. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a tumor with a high incidence and high mortality. These data justify screening programs to enable curative treatments to improve survival rates. Screening the population at risk (mainly patients with cirrhosis of the liver) should include ultrasonographic examination twice yearly. Given the vascular characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma, it can be detected using dynamic techniques (contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, CT, and MRI). In cases in which the enhancement pattern is not characteristic, these techniques should be complemented with lesion biopsy. Once hepatocellular carcinoma is diagnosed, the tumor is staged, and together with the clinical condition of the patient, the stage will determine the most appropriate treatment strategy in each case.
