Angiosarcoma of the liver as a rare cause of rapidly progressive liver failure. Angiosarcoma of the liver is a rare, highly malignant and sometimes diffusely infiltrating vessel tumor with rapid progression and poor prognosis.A 46-year-old male patient with rapidly progressive liver failure, initially regarded as decompensation of known alcoholic liver cirrhosis, is reported. The patient was referred to the authors' center for evaluation of liver transplantation, but a massive weight loss despite long absence of any alcohol intake raised the suspicion of a malignant disease. The abdominal ultrasound examination showed a massive hepatomegaly with an extremely inhomogeneous echo structure as well as moderate ascites. A following MRI demonstrated diffuse focal contrast enhancement in the entire liver parenchyma, confirming diffuse infiltration of the organ by a malignant tumor. In addition, MRI was suspicious of bone metastases. The usual tumor markers were normal. Sonographically guided percutaneous liver biopsy established the diagnosis of a malignant vascular tumor with diffuse infiltration of the liver parenchyma. 3 days later the patient died of uncontrollable bleeding from esophageal varices. Macroscopic examination of the liver during autopsy showed multiple lacunae filled with blood. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of a peliosis hepatis was raised. However, histology confirmed the diagnosis of a malignant angiosarcoma with diffuse osseous metastases.A diffuse infiltration of the liver by an angiosarcoma in the absence of any definite lesions may lead to a substantial delay of the diagnosis. The only relevant differential diagnosis in this case is the equally rare peliosis hepatis.
