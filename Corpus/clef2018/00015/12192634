An older female patient with refractory anemia and hemochromatosis. A 69-year-old woman was admitted because of a normocytic anemia. One year before an acute B19 parvovirus infection had been diagnosed, but the anemia was attributed to intestinal bleeding caused by a dysplastic colonic polyp. However, anemia persisted despite polypectomy. There was an excessive elevation of serum ferritin.A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate led to the diagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome (pure sideroblastic anemia). Ultrasound demonstrated advanced fibrosis of the liver. Fibrosis in association with severe parenchymatous siderosis was also demonstrated by histology. Analysis of the hemochromatosis gene (B-HFE, nt 845, G/A) was negative.The patient had secondary hemochromatosis due to a myelodysplastic syndrome. An acute infection with parvovirus B19 had been noted at the time of the first admission, one year before MDS was diagnosed. At that time, hemochromatosis had already caused fibrosis of the liver. However, complete regression of organ siderosis was achieved by deferoxamine administration. The myelodysplastic syndrome itself did not show any progression even 7 years after the diagnosis was established.Our case demonstrates the uncommon association between sideroblastic anemia and secondary hemochromatosis. Acute parvovirus infection may induce severe anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes. In acute B19 parvovirus infections an underlying hematologic disease should be excluded.
