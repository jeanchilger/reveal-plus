Ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome of pregnancy and the puerperium. There is little information on ischemic cerebrovascular pathology of pregnancy and puerperium. The clinical characteristics and the results of tomographic and angiographic evaluation of nine patients with ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome of pregnancy and puerperium are described. Venous thrombosis was the cause of cerebrovascular episode in 4 of the 9 patients presenting characteristic clinical manifestations and occurring particularly during puerperium. The diagnostic method of these cases was angiography since the scanner was normal in almost all the cases. Arterial pathology presented preferentially during pregnancy with no peculiar clinical characteristics being observed. In these cases the cerebral scanner was the best diagnostic technique. Follow-up suggested a better prognosis for venous pathology in terms of sequelae.
