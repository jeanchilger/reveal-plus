Isolated internal cerebral venous thrombosis in a neonate with increased lipoprotein (a) level: diagnostic and therapeutic considerations. Background. Internal cerebral venous thrombosis is a life-threatening condition, which requires immediate therapy. Being infrequent in childhood, internal venous thrombosis is very rare in the neonate and has never been observed without concomitant occlusion of further dural sinuses. Case Description. We report a neonate born at term, who developed seizures on the third day of life after normal pregnancy and uneventful delivery. Ultrasound and CT disclosed bilateral intraventricular and intracerebral hemorrhage with an unusual distribution for germinal matrix hemorrhage. MRI disclosed thrombotic occlusion of the straight sinus and the internal cerebral veins with concomitant bleeding into the ventricles, the basal ganglia, thalamus and the periventricular hemispheres. The other sinuses were not affected. The clinical condition of the child improved after initiation of a low-dose heparin treatment with subsequent partial recanalization of the occluded vessels. The screening for risk factors disclosed an elevated lipoprotein (a) level, also present in both parents. Conclusion. Internal cerebral venous thrombosis may be encountered in neonates and must be included in the list of differential diagnosis of perinatal intraventricular and intracerebral bleeding. MRI allows the diagnosis even in the absence of widespread dural sinus occlusion. Low dose heparin may be a therapeutic option in these cases. This is the first report of neonatal internal venous thrombosis due to hereditary lipoprotein (a) level elevation, which must be included in the list of possible predisposing conditions.
