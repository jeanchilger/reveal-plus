Management of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy. Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) is the major cause of maternal death in the UK, with recent trends showing an increase in the numbers of deaths. Underlying PTE is the problem of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). An appreciation of risk factors, particularly, thrombophilia, and signs or symptoms suggestive of thromboembolism, coupled with objective diagnosis and treatment should reduce mortality and morbidity. There are particular considerations with regard to the management of thrombosis in pregnancy, especially the use of anticoagulants. Low-molecular-weight heparins are now replacing unfractionated heparin for the treatment of DVT and PTE in pregnancy.
