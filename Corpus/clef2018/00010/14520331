Dural sinus thrombosis presenting three months postpartum. Dural sinus thrombosis is a rare complication of pregnancy and the puerperium. We report a case of dural sinus thrombosis that presented as a persistent headache and then a new-onset seizure in a previously healthy 28-year-old woman 3 months postpartum. Subtle changes consistent with sinus thrombosis were present on noncontrast computed tomography, but magnetic resonance venography ultimately confirmed the diagnosis. Anticonvulsant and anticoagulant therapy were initiated and maintained, and the patient recovered completely. Follow-up genetic analysis revealed heterozygosity for the Factor II 20210A variant of the prothrombin gene mutation.
