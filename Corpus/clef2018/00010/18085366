Emergency pulmonary embolectomy during the second trimester of pregnancy: report of a case. We report a case of acute massive pulmonary thromboembolism, which occurred during the second trimester of pregnancy in a 35-year-old woman with thrombocytopenia and anemia secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome. We performed successful emergency pulmonary embolectomy, under cardiopulmonary bypass, using argatroban as an anticoagulant. An intra-aortic balloon pump was used to maintain placental blood flow. The patient recovered completely and was later delivered of a healthy baby. Thus, pulmonary embolectomy saved both the mother and the fetus.
