Neuropsychological manifestations in a case of bilateral thalamic infarction. Neuropsychological manifestation has been reported with lesions of the anterior and non-specific thalamic nuclei and mammilothalamic tract (MMT). These have been reported in the setting of arterial infarction and/or haemorrhage. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cause of brain infarction. It occurs in the setting of oral contraceptive administration or pregnancy. Inherited thrombophilias are documented risk factors. The most frequent being heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. We report a single case of bilateral thalamic infarction due to cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis. Clinically the case manifested with memory impairment and dysexecutive symptoms. Predisposing factor for venous thrombosis was a homozygous factor V Leiden mutation. The patient was treated with anticoagulation and made a good recovery.
