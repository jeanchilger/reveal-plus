Postpartum cerebral venous thrombosis. Cerebral venous thrombosis is a rare entity in pregnancy and the postpartum period, with an incidence of 1:10,000 to 1:25,000.A 19-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, presented to the emergency department on postpartum day 7, having experienced seizures. Severe preeclampsia had been diagnosed during the antepartum period. The patient initially was diagnosed with postpartum eclampsia and started on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. Magnetic resonance imaging later showed cerebral venous thrombosis of the left transverse sinus and right frontal and left frontoparietal cortical veins.Cerebral venous thrombosis and eclampsia may manifest in a similar manner. Physicians can optimize the care of patients presenting with seizures by considering etiologies rarer than eclampsia and pursuing tests that may distinguish them.
