Cerebral venous thrombosis and familial prothrombin gene G20210a mutation. The prothrombin gene variant G20210A was first described as a risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, and recently for cerebral venous thrombosis, although reported cases had other concomitant risk factors.A 33 years old woman, with no previous vascular nor thrombotic risk factors, was admitted with thrombosis of superior longitudinal, lateral and sigmoid right sinus. The father had deep venous thrombosis 3 years before. One year later, the 29 year old sister of the proband, developed massive deep venous thrombosis, when she was 8 months pregnant. Laboratory investigations showed elevated anticardiolipin antibodies titer in the proband. Prothrombin activity was in the normal range in the 3 patients. Prothrombin gene mutation G 20210A was detected in the 3 patients.As the presence of more than one thrombophilic factor (in the reported case, prothrombin G20210A mutation and anticardiolipin antibodies) increases the likehood of a thrombotic event, it is useful to screen for thrombotic genetic conditions, even when other vascular risks are present, and vice versa.
