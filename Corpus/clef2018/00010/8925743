Reversible bilateral changes in cerebral proton-spin tomography in eclampsia. Case 1: A 19-year-old primigravida was hospitalised in the 24th week of pregnancy after a series of grand-mal seizures. Investigation showed the classical eclamptic triad of oedema, hypertension and proteinuria. Case 2: 6 days post-partum a 24-year-old primipara developed hypertension and typical clinical prodromata. Subsequently she had a series of sometimes initially focal grand-mal seizures.In both cases seizures ceased following pharmacological treatment. The pregnancy in the first case remained intact. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated characteristic findings in both cases, in case 1 bilateral disseminated supratentorial foci of oedema without space-occupying features, in case 2 occipital white matter oedema and several supratentorial foci. All changes were completely reversible, in case 1 after 10 days, in case 2 after 16 days.Together with the clinical findings the focal changes on MRI provide a characteristic picture. MRI can thus be an important aid to the diagnosis of eclampsia and will prevent a misinterpretation as focal encephalitis or venous sinus thrombosis.
