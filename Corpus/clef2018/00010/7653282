Recurrent intracardiac mass in a pregnant woman with antiphospholipid syndrome. Clinical manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome result from thromboembolic phenomena that occur in all vascular territories. Cardiac manifestations frequently associated with this syndrome include valvular and myocardial lesions. We present a case report of primary antiphospholipid syndrome in a pregnant young woman with a right atrial mass detected by echocardiography. Its morphological characteristics presented problems in establishing differential diagnosis within atrial thrombus and atrial myxoma. This case was complicated by pulmonary embolism and recurrence of the mass within four months. Cardiac surgery was performed and two masses excised. Histopathological studies showed them to be thrombotic in nature.
