Spontaneous resolution of marked dilatation of cerebral duro-venous system in newborn presenting with fetal hydrops. A newborn with antenatal diagnosis of fetal hydrops at 36 wk of gestation, presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) and generalized edema. Computed tomographic angiography showed marked dilatation of cerebral duro-venous system including vein of Galen (VOG), straight sinus, torcula and transverse sinus without evidence of arteriovenous fistulae at the vein of Galen. Dilatation of duro-venous system resolved with concomitant improvement in biventricular function and CHF with decongestive therapy. Such entity should be differentiated from more serious conditions like VOG malformation and venous sinus thrombosis.
