Prenatal diagnosis of Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome as a cause for in utero heart failure and severe postnatal sequelae. Ultrasound examination led to prenatal diagnosis of Klippel-Trénaunay-Weber syndrome complicated by early fetal congestive heart failure. The postnatal course was complicated by the Kasabach-Merritt syndrome of thrombocytopenia due to platelet consumption within the haemangioma. There was need for neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation and limb amputation.
