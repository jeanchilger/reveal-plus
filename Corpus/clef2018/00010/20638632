Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after gender reassignment surgery. Many factors have been implicated in the etiology of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT). These include head injury, cancer, infections (sepsis, sinusitis, and mastoiditis), coagulopathies, pregnancy, systemic lupus erythematosus, and dehydration.We present the case of a patient who received long-term estrogen therapy for approximately 15 years after feminizing genitoplasty. The patient experienced a CVT with an excellent clinical outcome. A similar case has not been reported in the literature.Because CVT may be associated with morbidity, mortality, and risks from the complications and treatments of the condition, further research is needed to clarify the factors that may contribute to the long-term risk of CVT in patients receiving long-term estrogen therapy after feminizing genitoplasty.
