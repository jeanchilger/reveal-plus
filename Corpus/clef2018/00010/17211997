Pregnancy-associated recurrent liver necrosis in patient with antiphospholipid syndrome. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with thromboembolic events, thrombocytopenia and numerous pregnancy complications such as recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. This condition is known as the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). We describe a rare case of recurrent liver necrosis postpartum in two consecutive pregnancies of woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) who underwent complete recovery.
