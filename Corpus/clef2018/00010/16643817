Maternal serum concentration of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor in women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler and in those with fetal growth restriction. This study was undertaken to determine whether maternal serum concentration of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its circulating antagonist, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE), are altered in pregnancies that subsequently develop PE and in those with established fetal growth restriction (FGR).Three groups of healthy pregnant women at 23 to 25 weeks of gestation were examined: group A (n = 42) with normal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, group B (n = 49) with abnormal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, and group C (n = 15) with abnormal Doppler results and established FGR. Comparisons between multiple groups were performed by using 1-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test.In group C, compared with group A, the median sFlt-1 was significantly higher (P < .0001) and VEGF was lower (P < .001). Group C included 3 women who had PE develop. In group B, 19 women had a normal outcome, 13 had PE develop, and 17 had FGR develop. There were no significant differences in sFlt-1 levels between any of the subgroups of group B and group A.Maternal serum concentration of sFlt-1 in pregnancies with FGR is increased but this increase is not evident in pregnancies with impaired placentation that subsequently had either FGR or PE develop.
