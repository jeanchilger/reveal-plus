Adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with multiple maternal thrombophilic factors. To determine to what extent adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with thrombophilia.We studied 31 women who had HELLP syndrome, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction or unexplained stillbirth (study group), matched with 12 controls. All women were tested for: Factor V, Prothrombin, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) mutations for Protein C, S and Antithrombin III deficiencyWomen with multiple thrombophilic factors had a significant lower birth weight (1568.33+/-146.8 g versus 2546.45+/-438 g), higher 24 h mean diastolic blood pressure at second trimester (76.3+/-12.5 mmHg versus 65.2+/-7.8 mmHg) and higher RI of uterine arteries (0.69+/-0.05 versus 0.50+/-0.15) than women with single thrombophilic factor.Multiple thrombophilic factors carry a major additional risk for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes and correlate well with placental maladaptation as indicated by uterine Doppler velocimetry and 24h BP monitoring.
