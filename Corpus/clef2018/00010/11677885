Cerebral infarction in conjunction with patent foramen ovale and May-Thurner syndrome. Stroke patients with paradoxical embolus mandate a search for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities. Iliac vein compression, or May-Thumer syndrome, places certain patients at risk for development of DVT. The authors present 3 stroke patients with patient foramen ovale and paradoxical cerebral embolism, with demonstrated iliac vein compression as the presumed source of their embolus. May-Thumer syndrome should be considered a potential source of clot, as definitive therapy of this disorder can be curative.
