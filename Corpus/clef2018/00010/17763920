Multifocal avascular necrosis revealing antiphospholipid syndrome. Osteonecrosis (ON) is a clinical entity characterized by death of bone marrow and trabecular bone as a result of disruption of blood supply to the bone. The antiphospholipid (APL) syndrome is characterized by arterial and/or venous thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity in association with APL antibodies. The involvement of multiple or atypical sites by ON has been reported, especially in association with APL antibodies. We described herein multiple and atypical infarcts which developed in a patient with primary APL syndrome.
