Neonatal sinovenous thrombosis associated with homozygous thermolabile methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in both mother and infant. The C677T mutation in 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) predicts substitution of valine for alanine at residue 223 (A223V). This thermolabile form of MTHFR has 50% reduced activity, has been associated with hyperhomocystinemia, and is a described risk factor for thrombosis in adults.(1-3) In addition, it has been associated with birth defects in the infants of affected mothers and with recurrent fetal losses.(4-6) We report the occurrence of sinovenous thrombosis in a newborn infant who presented with seizures. Both infant and mother were subsequently identified as having homozygous C677T alleles for MTHFR.
