Anomalies of the fetal venous system: a report of 26 cases and review of the literature. To evaluate sonographic appearance, natural history, and neonatal outcome of fetal venous anomalies.We performed an observational study, including all fetuses affected by abnormalities of the venous system diagnosed by ultrasound during the prenatal period.26 fetuses were identified. Other malformations were present in 5 cases (19.2%), 1 fetus had trisomy 21, and 1 fetus had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Twenty-five pregnancies ended in liveborn infants, and there was 1 case of unexplained intrauterine death in the fetus with IUGR affected by varix of the umbilical vein.Fetal venous anomalies are very rare and may be associated with fetal malformations or IUGR. Conservative management appears to be an adequate medical practice in the absence of other fetal problems, but in the presence of a varix of the umbilical vein, serial follow-up scans are needed to exclude the onset of hydrops or thrombosis of the varix.
