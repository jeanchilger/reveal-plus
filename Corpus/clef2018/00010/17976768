Cerebral venous thrombosis: a case report. The incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is three to four cases per one million in adults and seven cases per one million among children. We discuss a case of CVT in a 19-year-old woman with a history of migraine headaches. A CVT most commonly presents acutely, with a wide variety of signs and symptoms in young adults and children. The most common presenting complaint in adults is severe headache. The most frequently thrombosed sinuses are the lateral, cavernous, and superior sagittal sinuses. Risk factors include any genetic or acquired prothrombotic conditions, including pregnancy and the peripartum period. Computed tomography may show the classic "delta sign," although magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance venography is more sensitive. Treatment is controversial at this time. Options include fibrinolysis, anticoagulation, mechanical thrombectomy, or surgery. Despite the lack of agreement on management of CVT, the prognosis of CVT has improved, due to an increasing frequency of diagnosis.
