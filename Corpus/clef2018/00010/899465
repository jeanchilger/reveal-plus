Clinical picture and diagnosis of acute disorders of cerebral venous circulation. The authors studied 4 patients with acute disturbances of cerebral venous circulation. In 2 cases the diagnosis was verified by carotid angiography and sinusography, in 2 cases--by autopsy. The authors consider that for diagnostical purposes of paramount importance is the anamnesis which in some cases permits to reveal in the past thrombophlebits with different localization, an appearance of the first symptoms after delivery. Cerebral venous thrombosis is characterized by a polymorphism of neurological symptoms, their migration and multifocal localization. In some cases convulsive syndromes were observed and in half of the cases engorged popilla on the eye ground. Of special importance are the x-ray contrast methods and first of all carotid angiography which helps to eliminate a newgrowth of the brain and to detect thrombosis of the cerebral veins.
