Phase II study of helical tomotherapy for oligometastatic colorectal cancer. To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of helical tomotherapy in the treatment of oligometastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who were not amenable for metastasectomy and/or (further) systemic treatment.CRC patients with five or less metastases were enrolled. No limitations concerning dimension or localization of the metastases were imposed. Patients were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy, delivering a total dose of 40 Gy in fractions of 4 Gy. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was carried out at baseline and 3 months after the initiation of radiotherapy to evaluate the metabolic response rate according to PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) version 1.0. Side-effects were scored using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTC AE) version 3.0.Twenty-three patients were enrolled. A total of 52 metastases were treated. One patient (4%) experienced grade 3 vomiting two patients (9%) grade 2 diarrhea and dysphagia, respectively. Twenty-two patients were evaluated by post-treatment PET-CT. Five (23%) and seven patients (32%) achieved a complete and partial metabolic response, respectively, resulting in an overall metabolic response rate of 55%. The actuarial 1-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 54%, 25% and 86%, respectively.The use of helical tomotherapy in oligometastatic CRC patients resulted in a promising metabolic response rate of 55%.
