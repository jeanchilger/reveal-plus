Advance of diagnostic imaging in lung cancer. The rapid development of CT scanning and the advent of multislice CT have led to its increasing use in the evaluation of lung cancer. The widespread use of CT for the screening of lung cancer has resulted in the detection of many early-stage lung cancers. Recently, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) systems have become an extremely useful tool in evaluating the primary tumors, regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis in patients with lung cancer. Moreover, the latest MRI and CAD (Computer-Aided Diagnosis) systems have been introduced in actual clinical practice. This review focuses on the current imaging techniques used to evaluate patients with lung cancer.
