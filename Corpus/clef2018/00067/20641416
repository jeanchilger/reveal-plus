. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease associated with an irreversible decline of mental functions and with cognitive impairment (1). It is characterized pathologically by neuronal loss with the presence in the brain of senile plaques of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of filaments that contain the hyperphosphorylated protein tau (2, 3). Accelerated deposition of Aβ deposits seems to be a key risk factor associated with AD. Early diagnosis of AD is important for treatment consideration and disease management (4). Several radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed (5-7) and tested in humans as
