Case involving long-term survival after esophageal cancer with liver and lung metastases treated by multidisciplinary therapy: report of a case. A 57-year-old male with lower esophageal cancer underwent subtotal esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy. The histopathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, pT2N1M0 pStageIIB. After one course of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy involving low-dose CDDP/5FU, a PET-CT scan obtained 12 months after surgery revealed a solitary liver metastasis in the S2 area. The patient then underwent five courses of docetaxel chemotherapy (80 mg/body, tri-weekly), and a partial response was observed. We also performed radiofrequency ablation (RFA), after which a complete response was observed. Twenty months after surgery, we detected local liver recurrence in the same position and performed additional RFA. Twenty-four months after surgery, a solitary lung metastasis was detected in the left S2 area and the patient was administered five additional courses of docetaxel therapy. Subsequently, PET-CT revealed growth of lung and liver tumors without recurrence in other areas. Twenty-nine months after surgery, we partially excised metastatic liver and lung tumors, and no subsequent recurrence has since been detected. The prognoses of patients who suffer from esophageal cancer organ recurrence are known to be extremely poor, and optimal therapeutic strategies for treating these patients have not been established. This long-term survival case suggests that multidisciplinary therapy for the treatment of liver and lung recurrence after esophagectomy is effective.
