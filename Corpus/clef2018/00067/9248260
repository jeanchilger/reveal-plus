Cost effectiveness analysis of FDG-PET in the differential diagnosis and staging of lung cancer in Japan. Several studies have shown that FDG-PET is more accurate than CT for the differential diagnosis and for the staging of lung cancer. We have analyzed potential effect of FDG-PET on the medical cost for the management of patients suspected of lung cancer. In the differential diagnosis, chest CT plus FDG-PET protocol reduced the number of bronchofiberscope (BFS) and biopsy by one fourth of that in the conventional protocol using CT alone. PET protocol reduced unnecessary examinations for the patients of benign disease, however, it increased the total cost of examinations by 25% due to the higher cost of PET than that of BFS and biopsy in Japan. In the staging of lung cancer, PET protocol improved accuracy of staging, reduced unnecessary surgery by 67%, and showed a saving of the cost of examination by 5%, and the total medical cost by 2.5% compared to that in the conventional protocol using CT, brain MRI, and bone scan.Use of FDG-PET for the staging may contribute to the improvement of patient management of lung cancer patients also to the saving of the medical cost.
