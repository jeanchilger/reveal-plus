Advances in penumbra imaging with MR. The concept of the ischaemic penumbra as critically hypoperfused and functionally impaired, but potentially viable brain, was introduced over 25 years ago. Recent studies have used a combination of perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to delineate the putative penumbra. PWI provides semiquantitative cerebral blood flow imaging and DWI is an index of the largely irreversible ischaemic core. PWI > DWI mismatch is an operational definition of the penumbra that was introduced in the late 1990s. This definition has been modified in recent years with the recognition that the PWI boundary includes a region of benign oligaemia and that a portion of the DWI core is potentially salvageable with rapid reperfusion. An MRI penumbral signature is present in the majority of patients within 6 h of stroke onset, often but not invariably associated with proximal arterial occlusion on magnetic resonance angiography, and is strictly time dependent. It has been postulated that penumbral imaging using MRI can provide a physiological 'tissue clock' and be used to predict benefit from thrombolytic therapy beyond the established 3-hour window. This has been suggested by pilot studies, but confirmation will rely on ongoing, prospective, randomized trials. The presence and extent of the penumbra may also predict the opportunity for tissue salvage with neuroprotection strategies. DWI and PWI parameters are being used in proof-of-principle stroke trials. Such trials can be performed with 100-200 patients randomized between treated and control groups and provide a biological signal of efficacy with only 10% of the sample size required for a Phase III study.
