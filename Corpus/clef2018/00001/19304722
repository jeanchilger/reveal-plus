Adenomyosis: sonohysterography with MRI correlation. The purpose of this study was to describe the sonohysterographic features of adenomyosis with MRI correlation.In this study, when the sonohysterographic findings suggested adenomyosis, MRI findings confirmed the diagnosis in 96% of cases. Myometrial cracks are, to our knowledge, a previously undescribed sonohysterographic sign of adenomyosis.
