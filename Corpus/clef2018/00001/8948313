Risks of ovulation-induction therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus. We report on four women with systemic lupus erythematosus who developed two types of complications after ovulation-induction therapy for primary or secondary infertility. Primary infertility was associated with endometriosis in one patient. Three had previously known systemic lupus erythematosus. All had inactive disease at onset of ovulation-induction therapy. Three patients developed symptoms consistent with moderate lupus flare a few weeks after the onset of ovulation-induction therapy. One patient developed inferior vena cava and unilateral left renal vein thrombosis. No patient became pregnant. A high oestrogen level induced by ovulation-induction therapy may explain the occurrence of lupus flare in patients with prior inactive lupus. All our patients had prior asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibodies. One patient developed a major thrombotic event. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies increases the thrombotic risk related to ovulation-induction therapy. We conclude that ovulation-induction therapy should be restricted to patients with long-standing inactive systemic lupus erythematosus. A preventive increase of the corticosteroid dosage should be proposed in addition to heparin or antiaggregant therapy for those with prior asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibodies, or with heparin therapy for those with prior antiphospholipid antibody-related events.
