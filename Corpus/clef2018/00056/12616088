Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT): Clinical Applications. Positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography are nuclear imaging modalities that excel in depicting the biological function of tissue. Unlike structural imaging methods, they provide functional diagnostic information about brain neoplasms, stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, epilepsy, cortical visual loss, and migraine.
