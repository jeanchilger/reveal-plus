Pharmacological evaluation of (+)-2- [123I]A-69024: a radioligand for in vivo studies of dopamine D1 receptors. (+)-2-[123I] A-69024, [(+)-1-(2-[123I] iodo-4,5-dimethoxy-benzyl)-7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline], is a specific and enantioselective dopamine D1 receptor radioligand. The in vivo biodistribution of this radioligand in rats showed high brain uptake and a distribution consistent with the density of dopamine D1 receptors. Highest uptake was observed in the striatum (0.65 %ID/g) at 5 min followed by clearance. As a measure of specificity the striatum/cerebellar ratio reached a maximum of 3.9 at 30 min post-injection. Radioactivity in the striatum was reduced by 68% by pre-administration of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390. Pre-administration of other dopamine binding drugs, spiperone (D2), 7-OH-DPAT (D3), and clozapine (D4) displayed no inhibitory effect on (+)-2-[123I]A-69024 accumulation in any brain region. Ketanserin (5-HT2/5-HT2C) and haloperidol (D2 receptor antagonist/sigma receptor ligand) also displayed no inhibitory effect in any brain region studied. With the pharmacologically inactive enantiomer, (-)-2-[123I]A-69024, the brain uptake was determined to be non-specific since a striatum/cerebellar ratio of near 1 was observed throughout the time course of the experiment. (+)-2-[123I]A-69024 displays enantioselectivity for dopamine D1 receptors and may deserve further investigation as a possible SPECT radioligand.
