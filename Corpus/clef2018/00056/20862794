6,7-Dimethoxy-2-[3-(5-[ One of the mechanisms of tumor cells to escape the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents, such as adriamycin, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, actinomycin D, and paclitaxel, is to limit their presence inside the cells by way of a multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene protein (1, 2). The MDR-1 gene encodes a transmembrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as an ATP-dependent multidrug transporter that is capable of actively pumping a variety of agents out of the cells. Injection of unlabeled efflux pump substrates increases the retention of the radioactivity in the tumor by blocking the efflux rather than reducing radioactivity as seen with receptor-binding radiotracer blocking studies. Overexpression of P-gp in tumor cells (such as renal carcinoma, hepatoma, pheochromocytoma, and colon carcinoma) leads to resistance to anticancer drugs (3). P-gp is also present in a variety of normal cells, such as intestinal mucosal cells, hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (4, 5). Calcium channel blockers (such as verapamil), cyclosporine (CsA, P-gp inhibitor) and CsA's non-immunosuppressive analog PSC 833 (other mechanism) are MDR modulators that inhibit the transport of P-gp substrates out of the cells (6, 7).
