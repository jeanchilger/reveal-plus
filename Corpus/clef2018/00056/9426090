Whole-body 18FDG positron emission tomography in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer. Despite advances in morphological imaging, some patients with lung cancer are found to have nonresectable disease at surgery or die of recurrence within yr of surgery. We performed a prospective study in 109 patients to compare the accuracy of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (18FDG) and conventional imaging (CI) methods for the staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). When CI or PET study suggested metastatic disease, confirmation was obtained by biopsy or follow-up information. As compared to CI, 18FDG-PET correctly changed the N stage in 22 patients (33%) and the M stage in 15 patients (14%). For the detection of distant metastases, PET study showed five false-positive sites and no false-negative cases. Currently, the accuracy of PET in the detection of M stage is 96%. Our study shows that visual interpretation of whole-body fluorine-18 deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography images can improve the diagnostic accuracy in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer. Further experience is needed to establish if metabolic imaging would be a cost-effective tool in the future management of lung cancer.
