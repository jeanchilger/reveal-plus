Anatomically derived attenuation coefficients for use in quantitative single photon emission tomography studies of the thorax. Elimination of errors due to poor attenuation correction is an essential part of any quantitative single photon emission tomography (SPET) technique. Attenuation coefficients (mu Tc) for use in attenuation correction of SPET data were determined using technetium 99m and cobalt 57 flood sources and using topographical information obtained from computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance (MR) images. In patients with carcinoma of the bronchus, the mean attenuation coefficient for 99mTc was 0.096 cm-1 when determined across a transverse section of the thorax at the level of the tumour by means of a 57Co flood source (13 patients) and 0.093 and 0.074 cm-1 as determined from CT scans for points in the centre of the tumour and contralateral normal lung, respectively (21 patients). In 18 patients with breast tumours, the mean attenuation coefficient for 99mTc was 0.110 and 0.076 cm-1 when determined from MRI cross-sections for points in the centre of the tumour and normal contralateral lung, respectively. This indicates significant overcorrection for attenuation when the conventional value of 0.12 cm-1 is used. A value in the range 0.08-0.09 cm-1 would be more appropriate for SPET studies of the thorax. An alternative approach to quantitative region of interest (ROI) analysis is to perform attenuation correction appropriate to the centre of each ROI (using topographical information derived from CT or MRI) on non-attenuation-corrected reconstructions.
