How to diagnose giant cell arteritis. Current debate on how to diagnose giant cell arteritis (GCA) has strayed from the traditional approach of temporal artery biopsy and has instead explored the effectiveness of alternative imaging modalities.We have reviewed the literature and pooled published results for temporal artery imaging including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Duplex ultrasound, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan.The results of this review show that ultrasound and MRI both represent viable options for evaluation of GCA however utilizing ultrasound first may be the best first option in diagnostic tools. In 1990 the American College of Rheumatology offered criteria for positive pathology in GCA.In this study, we propose a risk stratification criteria as well as an algorithm for the best diagnostic approach when GCA is suspected.
