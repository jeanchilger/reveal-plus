PET-CT in the oncological translational platforms. Molecular Imaging is changing the development of new therapies. Conventional imaging methods evaluate response based in the reduction of tumour size, which often is a late effect and, therefore, it can take months to confirm the efficacy of an antitumoral therapy. Systems based in imaging biomarkers or radiotracers, as PET and PET-CT can detect the response as soon as a few days after initiation of therapy. A large number of imaging radiotracers has been proposed. They are capable of supplying a varied information: metabolism, cellular proliferation, DNA replication, protein or membrane lipids synthesis, amino acid transport, angiogenesis, hypoxia, apoptosis, etc.
