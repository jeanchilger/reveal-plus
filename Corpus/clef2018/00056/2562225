Feline immunodeficiency virus infection in a population of pet cats from southeastern Florida. Blood samples from 95 randomly selected pet cats that were brought to veterinarians in southeastern Florida were tested for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Virus-specific antibodies (indicative of virus infection) were found in 8 of the 95 (8.4%) cats tested. All of the virus-infected cats were males (statistically significant, P less than or equal to 0.016) and were at least 1 year of age. The 3 most severely ill cats infected with FIV were also infected with feline leukemia virus.
