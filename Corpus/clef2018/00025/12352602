Biodistribution and displacement studies of the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist 123I-5-I-R91150 in the normal dog. There is increasing interest in mapping receptors in vivo by using functional imaging modalities such as single photon emission tomography (SPET) and positron emission tomography (PET). Since SPET is a more accessible functional imaging modality than PET and, overall, it is more economical, radioligands suitable for this technique are in greater demand. Recently, 123I-5-I-R91150, a radioligand with high selectivity and affinity for 5-HT(2A) receptors in the brain, was introduced for SPET. This study reports on the whole-body distribution and brain uptake of the selective 123I-5-I-R91150 ligand in four normal dogs. The frontal to cerebellar ratio of uptake in time was determined in three dogs. Time-activity curve of venous blood was determined in one dog. Maximal global brain uptake was found at 10-60 min post-injection. Higher brain uptake was noted in the frontal cortical areas compared to the cerebellum. The frontal-cerebellar ratio reached the highest values at 90-180 min. Reversibility and pharmacological selectivity of ligand binding was demonstrated through displacement and blocking studies with the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist ketanserin. This study demonstrates that the specific 5-HT(2A) iodinated ligand can be used for imaging and semi-quantification of the 5-HT(2A) receptors in the canine brain in vivo by using SPET.
