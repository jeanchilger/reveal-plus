Clinical applications of FDG-PET in oncology. Positron emission tomography together with F-18-deoxyglucose (FDG) has emerged as a valuable clinical tool in the field of oncology. FDG-PET diagnoses, stages and restages most cancers with a high diagnostic accuracy. The effects of chemotherapy on tumour metabolism can be monitored with this whole-body technique. Recent studies have established a high prognostic accuracy of PET for predicting the clinical outcome of cancer patients. The current review addresses the role of FDG-PET for diagnosing, staging and restaging of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and breast cancer staging and provides a brief outlook for future applications of clinical PET imaging.
