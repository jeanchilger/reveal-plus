Characterization of extrahepatic distribution of Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin in hepatic perfusion imaging studies prior to yttrium-90 microsphere therapy. Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin (MAA) hepatic perfusion study and hepatic angiography are routinely performed prior to yttrium-90 (Y-90) microsphere therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic cancers to the liver. The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of altered Tc-99m MAA distribution in these patients and to identify factors that are associated with these changes. A total of 176 Tc-99m MAA hepatic perfusion studies in 159 patients performed in preparation for Y-90 microsphere therapy were retrospectively reviewed. Abnormal findings were identified and correlated with diagnosis, infusion site, tumor volume, and tumor uptake by using bivariate statistical analysis. Abnormal Tc-99m MAA distribution on the hepatic perfusion imaging studies include excessive hepatopulmonary shunting with an elevated shunting fraction (>10% n=23, 13%) and abnormal intra-abdominal visceral deposition in the GI tract, pancreas, spleen, and umbilical vein (n=19
