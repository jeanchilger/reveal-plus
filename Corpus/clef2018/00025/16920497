Non-invasive imaging of dendritic cell migration in vivo. Dendritic cells (DCs) play important roles in the initiation of adaptive immune responses. The transport of antigen from the infection site to the draining lymph node by DCs is a crucial component in this process. Accordingly, immunotherapeutic applications of in vitro-generated DCs require reliable methods experimentally in mice and clinically in patients to monitor the efficiency of their successful lymph node homing after injection. Recent developments of new methods to follow DC migration by non-invasive imaging modalities such as scintigraphy, PET, MRI, or bioluminescence imaging, have gained attraction because of their potential clinical applicability. The current state of the literature and a comparative evaluation of the methods are reported in this review.
