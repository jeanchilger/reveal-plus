Cerebral blood flow and metabolism in hypertensive patients with cerebral infarction. The authors investigated, by positron emission tomography, the effect of long-standing hypertension on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen metabolism in patients with chronic atherothrombotic brain infarction. In the nonbrain infarct (non-BI) group (n = 13, mean age: sixty-two years), the regional CBF (rCBF) was decreased significantly with a rise in the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in the cerebral cortexes (r = -0.575) and the deep gray matter (r = -0.451), whereas the regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (rCMRO2) remained unchanged. In the brain infarct (BI) group (n = 22, mean age: fifty-eight years), however, the rCBF as well as the rCMRO2 were reduced even in the normotensive patients and thus did not correlate with the MABP. These results suggest that long-standing hypertension per se causes a reduction in the rCBF but not in the oxygen metabolism with a compensatory increase in the oxygen extraction fraction. On the other hand, patients with brain infarction, even normotensives, show a diffuse decrease in cerebral circulation and metabolism, which is probably due to the more severe sclerotic changes that take place in the cerebral vessels.
