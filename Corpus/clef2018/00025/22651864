Impact of noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes on carotid wall 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography uptake. In this study, the impact of noninsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus on carotid wall (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in patients with documented or suspected cardiovascular disease was evaluated.Inflammation is a pivotal process in the progression of atherosclerosis, which can be noninvasively imaged by FDG positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).Carotid artery wall FDG uptake was quantified in 134 patients (age 60.2 ± 9.7 years diabetic subjects, n = 43). The pre-scan glucose (gluc) level corrected mean of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) values ((mean)SUV(gluc)), mean of the maximum target-to-background ratio ((mean)TBR(gluc)), and single hottest segment (SHS(gluc)) of FDG uptake in the artery wall were calculated. Associations between FDG uptake, the presence of risk factors for atherosclerosis, and diabetes were then assessed by multiple regression analysis with backward elimination.The study demonstrated a significant association between diabetes and FDG uptake in the arterial wall (diabetes (mean)SUV(gluc) β = 0.324, (mean)TBR(gluc) β = 0.317, and SHS(gluc) β = 0.298 for all, p < 0.0001). In addition, in diabetic patients, both body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ((mean)SUV(gluc) β = 0.4, (mean)TBR(gluc) β = 0.357, and SHS(gluc) β = 0.388Type 2 diabetes was significantly associated with carotid wall FDG uptake in patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease. In diabetic patients, obesity and smoking add to the risk of increased FDG uptake values.
