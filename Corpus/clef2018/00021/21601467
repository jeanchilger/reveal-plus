Premature craniosynostosis--the role of skull base surgery in its correction. A surgical and radiological experience of 172 operated infants/children. Most craniofacial abnormalities are non-syndromic craniosynostoses due to premature fusion of one or more craniofacial sutures. Functional impairment is caused either by a pathological growth pattern or increased intracranial pressure. The indications for surgery are to increase intracranial volume and to correct aesthetics.We retrospectively reviewed 172 patients who had been operated on for premature craniosynostosis, including fronto-orbital advancement, from 1992 to 2002. Demographic data, clinical follow-up findings, and regular photo documentation were analyzed.After a mean follow-up of 6 years the overall outcome for those operated on within the first 6 months of life was satisfactory in 97%. The remaining 3% were reoperated at between 4 and 6 years of age. All cephalometric indices normalized postoperatively. Eight patients underwent SPECT studies which showed preoperative perfusion asymmetry corresponding to the fused sutures that were normalized following surgical decompression. No severe perioperative complications were seen.Cephalometric parameters represent an excellent method to compare the postoperative outcome. Standard skull base procedures need to be adapted carefully to the individual form of craniosynostosis to avoid an unfavourable result. Single Photon Emissin Computed Tomography (SPECT) studies give evidence that correction of single cranial suture synostosis allows for normalization of cerebral blood flow and should be performed within first 6-8 months of life.
