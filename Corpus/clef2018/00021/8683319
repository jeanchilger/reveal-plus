Thallium-201 uptake, histopathological differentiation and Na-K ATPase in lung adenocarcinoma. To clarify differences in accumulation in 201 Tl scintigraphy, we examined the relationship between uptake of 201 Tl, histopathological differentiation and Na-K ATPase.Thallium-201 SPECT was performed twice: 15 min (early scan) and 120 min (delayed scan) after intravenous injection of 3 mCi 201 Tl-chloride. The uptake ratio of 201 Tl was calculated and compared with the grade of differentiation and the staining pattern of Na-K ATPase.The sensitivity of 201 Tl SPECT for well-differentiated adenocarcinomas was lower than that for moderately and poorly differentiated ones. The uptake ratio on the delayed scan was significantly lower in the well-differentiated group than that in the moderately and poorly differentiated groups. This parameter was also significantly higher in the Na-K ATPase-positive group than the -negative group.These results indicate that the uptake ratio of 201 Tl SPECT may be a noninvasive indicator of the grade of pathological differentiation of adenocarcinoma and provide insight into the relationship among 201 Tl SPECT, malignancy and Na-K ATPase.
