The incremental value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in paediatric malignancies. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been used in the assessment of paediatric malignancies. PET/CT increases the diagnostic accuracy in adult cancer patients. The present study assesses the incremental value of FDG PET/CT in paediatric malignancies.A total of 118 (18)FDG PET/CT studies of 46 paediatric patients were reviewed retrospectively. PET and PET/CT results were classified as malignant, equivocal or benign, compared on a site- and study-based analysis, and also compared with the clinical outcome.Three hundred and twenty-four sites of increased FDG uptake were detected. Discordant PET and PET/CT interpretations were found in 97 sites (30%) in 27 studies (22%). PET yielded a statistically significant higher proportion of equivocal and a lower proportion of benign lesion and study results (p<0.001) than PET/CT. With PET there were 153 benign (47%), 84 (26%) equivocal and 87 (27%) malignant sites, while PET/CT detected 226 benign (70%), 10 (3%) equivocal and 88 (27%) malignant lesions. PET/CT mainly improved the characterisation of uptake in brown fat (39%), bowel (17%), muscle (8%) and thymus (7%). The study-based analysis showed that 17 equivocal and seven positive PET studies (20%) were interpreted as benign on PET/CT, while three equivocal studies were interpreted as malignant. The study-based sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT were 92% and 78% respectively.PET/CT significantly improved the characterisation of abnormal (18)FDG foci in children with cancer, mainly by excluding the presence of active malignancy in sites of increased tracer activity.
