Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in a population of infants with diarrhea in Chile. The incidence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) was investigated in 95 E. coli strains isolated from 48 infants with diarrhea in Santiago, Chile. By using standard biological assays and DNA-DNA hybridization procedures, ETEC was found in 31.2% of the cases: 14 strains produced heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) only, three strains produced heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and ST, and two strains produced LT only. DNA probes detected all enterotoxin producers except one ST-producing strain. The ST strains hybridized with one or both of the human ST probes (ST Ib and ST A2). Two of the LT-ST strains hybridized with the ST Ia and ST Ib probes, and the third strain did not hybridize with any of the ST probes. Only the ST group expressed multiple resistance (85.7%) and colonization factor antigen I (CFA I) (92.8%) CFA II was found in two of three LT-ST strains. The O153:H45 serotype was found in 10 of 14 ST strains, and O6:K15:H16 was found in one LT strain and in two LT-ST strains. These findings suggest that ETEC, especially strains that produce ST, may be an important cause of diarrhea among Chilean infants.
