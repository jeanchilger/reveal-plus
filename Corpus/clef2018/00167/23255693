Glycoprotein B genotyping in congenital/perinatal Cytomegalovirus infection in symptomatic infants. Molecular epidemiological studies on circulating strains of CMV in cogenital/perinatal infections have not been done earlier in this region.To study the glycoprotein B genotypes in babies with symptomatic congenital/perinatal CMV infection and to assess the possible influence of genotype on the outcome of the infection.Clinical samples (blood and urine) of symptomatic babies are sent to the Virology Department of NCDC, Delhi for the diagnosis of congenital infections. 375 clinical samples of infants (newborn - 6 months old) were included for the study. Serum samples were subjected to ELISA for detection of IgM antibodies against CMV. DNA isolation and amplification of CMV genomic DNA targeting gB gene fragment by nested PCR, was carried out in the samples. The amplified fragment including the cleavage site was subjected to RFLP using restriction enzymes Rsal and Hinf1. They were also verified by sequencing using Big Dye Terminator chemistry.75 samples out of 375 tested were confirmed positive for CMV infection by serology and PCR. Both RFLP and sequencing of gB gene fragment showed that gB 1, 2 and 3 genotypes were in circulation. gB 3 was the most prevalent genotype in symptomatic infants. Hepatosplenomegaly was the most common feature in gB-3 genotype of CMV. gB2 congenital CMV infection was more commonly associated with long term sequelae.
