Rotaviruses in younger children in Novosibirsk in 2005-2007: detection and genotyping. Examination of 1898 patients with acute enteric infection from March 2005 to February 2007 showed that group A rotaviruses were the most frequent cause (35%) of acute gastroenteritis among children under 3 years of age. Majority of cases of rotavirus infection was detected in infants under 1 year of age (71.8%). The peak of sporadic incidence was observed between February and May. High rate of mixed infection (45.6%) was observed - associations of rotaviruses with other viruses (noroviruses, astroviruses) and bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and opportunistic species) were detected. P- and G-genotypes of 337(50.8%) isolates of group A rotaviruses were determined by RT-PCR. The most prevalent strain was P[8]G1 (54.6%) followed by P[8]G3 (10.7%), P[8]G9 (8.6%), P[4]G2 (8.3%), and P[8]G4 (4.5%) genotypes.
