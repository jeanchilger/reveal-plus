Soft-tissue pyogenic infection in neonates caused by Staphylococcus aureus carrying Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes. To investigate the pathogen causing soft-tissue pyogenic infection in neonate.The isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were obtained from liquor puris and blood by routine method. The Automated Microbiology Analyzer was used for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test of the isolates. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes were determined by multiplex PCR in the isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to determine the sequence types (STs) of the isolates. The genotypes of SCCmec were also determined by another multiplex PCR in the isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).In 3 cases of neonate with soft-tissue pyogenic infection, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from liquor puris in 2 cases. 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from liquor puris and blood from another case. All 4 isolates were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains carrying PVL genes. Their SCCmec types were SCCmec IIIA. The STs of 4 isolates were ST88. The antimicrobial-resistance profile of the isolates were the same except erythromycin.Soft-tissue pyogenic infection in the 3 neonates was caused by the same clone of MRSA carrying PVL genes.
