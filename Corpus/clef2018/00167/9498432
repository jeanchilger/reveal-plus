Maternal viral genotypic zidovudine resistance and infrequent failure of zidovudine therapy to prevent perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 076. Maternal samples were assessed from 96 women enrolled in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 076 to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotypic zidovudine resistance at entry, if zidovudine resistance developed on study, and the role of zidovudine resistance in vertical transmission of HIV-1 despite zidovudine therapy. Low and high levels of genotypic resistance were assessed by differential hybridization, oligoligation, or direct sequencing of plasma HIV-1 RNA for codons K70R and T215Y/F. None of the women had high-level genotypic resistance to zidovudine at study entry or delivery. For low-level zidovudine resistance, the 95% confidence intervals were 0.3%-6.8% for baseline prevalence and 0.3%-14% for delivery incidence. Low-level zidovudine resistance, adjusted for plasma viral RNA level at delivery, was not strongly associated with an increase in vertical transmission risk (odds ratio, 4.8 95% confidence interval, 0.2-131
