PCR-mediated search for herpes simplex virus DNA in sections of brain from patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been shown to cause central nervous system demyelination in experimental animals and several studies have implicated HSV in the aetiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). We have used the polymerase chain reaction to look for DNA of both type 1 HSV (HSV-1) and type 2 HSV (HSV-2) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded brain tissues from patients with MS and other neurological diseases. Primers which amplify a fragment of the normal cellular gene c-myc were included in the reactions to assess the preservation of DNA in the tissue samples. 77 plaques of demyelination from 23 patients with MS were examined. HSV-1 DNA was amplified from only one plaque. This plaque involved the trigeminal root entry zone in the pons and it is suggested that the presence of viral DNA was related to the site examined rather than to the demyelination per se. HSV-2 DNA was amplified from none of the plaques. As expected, HSV-1 DNA was detected in the brains of 6 patients who died of HSV-1 encephalitis and HSV-2 DNA was amplified from the brain of a neonate with congenital HSV-2 infection. In sections of brain from 39 patients with a wide range of other neurological diseases HSV-1 DNA was detected in the pons of only 1 patient, who had AIDS associated with cytomegalovirus ventriculitis subsequent investigation confirmed the presence of concomitant HSV-1 brain stem infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
