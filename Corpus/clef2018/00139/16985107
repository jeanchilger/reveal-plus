MRI of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. CT is the established imaging technique for evaluation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. MRI, however, can play a major role in this disease. The objective of this study is to illustrate the strengths of MRI for evaluating pancreatic adenocarcinoma.The superior soft-tissue contrast of MRI compared with CT is useful in the detection and characterization of non-contour-deforming pancreatic masses. MRI compared with CT may be more sensitive in the detection of distant disease, better for defining appropriate surgical candidates, and better for characterizing small liver metastases and peritoneal and omental metastases.
