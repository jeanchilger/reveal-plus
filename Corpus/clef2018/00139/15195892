The substitution of endoscopic ultrasonography for endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography: implications for service development and training. Diagnostic indications of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) have not completely disappeared. But the substitution of this examination by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the work-up of biliary and pancreatic diseases is supported by EUS's reliability and cost-effectiveness. In the future EUS will be challenged by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), when easily available. Therefore, the choice between EUS, MRCP and ERCP will become simplified: MRCP as the first option for diagnosis, EUS in doubtful cases needing sampling for pathology and ERCP as a therapeutic alternative to some surgical procedures.
