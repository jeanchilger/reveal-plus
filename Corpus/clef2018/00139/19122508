Neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas: endoscopic diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. This review highlights advances over the last year in EUS in the evaluation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.We will focus on recent findings regarding the accuracy of EUS, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-fine needle aspiration), emerging cytologic markers obtained from fine needle aspiration samples, and the role of EUS screening for patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome. Additionally, we will introduce potential therapeutic EUS interventions in the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.The present review highlights recent advances in the utility of EUS in the clinical management of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Key studies from the last year demonstrate the important role of EUS in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
