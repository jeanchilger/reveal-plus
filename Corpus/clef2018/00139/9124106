Iron overload in reticuloendothelial systems of pediatric oncology patients who have undergone transfusions: MR observations. Pediatric oncology patients who undergo intensive chemotherapy develop anemia caused by myeloid suppression that necessitates transfusions that, in turn, cause iron deposition in the reticuloendothelial system. We describe MR imaging of iron overload in pediatric patients who underwent such chemotherapy and who have solid and hematologic tumors.The MR appearance of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow was evaluated in 13 children with both solid (n = 10) and hematologic (n = 3) malignant lesions using known criteria for the presence of iron deposition. Findings were correlated with transfusional history, chemotherapeutic regimens, and ferritin levels.MR imaging obtained after chemotherapy and transfusional therapy revealed signs of iron deposition in the liver and spleen, particularly on T2-weighted images. Bone marrow signal intensity varied among patients. Pancreatic signal intensity was normal. Ferritin levels were elevated in all patients.Reticuloendothelial system iron deposition present in follow-up MR imaging of pediatric solid and hematologic malignant lesions reflected the intensity of the chemotherapeutic regimen, the degree of myeloid suppression, and the resultant transfusional requirements. Such iron deposition appeared to have no effect on cardiac, liver, or pancreatic function.
