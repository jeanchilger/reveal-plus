Solid, cystic and vanishing tumors of the pancreas. Two girls with pancreatic tumors are reported. They were presented with abdominal pain, no history of abdominal injury and no tumor marker abnormalities. Imaging studies demonstrated that the tumors in two patients had both solid and cystic components. The tumors gradually regressed and finally disappeared without any treatment. There has been no evidence of recurrence in 5- and 4-year observation periods, respectively. Pancreatic tumor with solid and cystic components may rarely be self-limited.
