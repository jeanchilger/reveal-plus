Acute pancreatitis after gynecologic and obstetric surgery. Our goal was to evaluate the prevalence and comorbidity of acute postoperative pancreatitis after gynecologic and obstetric surgery.We reviewed the Mayo Medical Center surgical database (January 1953-January 1997) to identify all confirmed cases of acute pancreatitis occurring within the standard 6-week postoperative convalescence after obstetric and gynecologic surgical procedures. Pancreatitis as a result of concurrent pancreatic or biliary surgery was excluded. Pertinent clinical data were reviewed.Eleven cases of postoperative pancreatitis were identified, with an overall incidence of 1 in 17,000 surgical procedures. Postoperative pancreatitis was more common after obstetric surgery. Identifiable risk factors were noted in 45% of cases, with occult cholelithiasis the predominant factor. Presenting signs and symptoms were primarily epigastric pain, oliguria, and ileus. Significant morbidity or mortality was noted in 27% of the cases.Acute postoperative pancreatitis is a rare complication after gynecologic and obstetric surgery. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis are nonspecific in the postoperative setting. Prompt diagnosis and supportive therapy are essential to minimize morbidity and mortality.
