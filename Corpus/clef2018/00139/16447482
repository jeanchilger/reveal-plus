Spontaneous subcapsular splenic hematoma: a rare complication of pancreatitis. Subcapsular hematoma of the spleen is a rare complication of pancreatitis despite its close proximity to the pancreas. Pancreatic pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas may erode into the splenic hilum causing hilar vessel bleeding with subcapsular dissection and hematoma formation. The management of such complication is still controversial. It has been suggested that most of these complications spontaneously regress and therefore can be managed conservatively. A case of spontaneous splenic subcapsular hematoma resulting from pancreatitis was managed conservatively with a good outcome.
