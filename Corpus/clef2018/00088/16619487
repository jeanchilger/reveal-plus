Comparative evaluation of FET and FDG for differentiating lung carcinoma from inflammation in mice. Clinical FDG/PET (2-deoxy-2-18F-fluoro-D-glucose/positron emission tomography) studies encounter difficulties in detecting early stage lung cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of O-2-18F-fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine (FET) and FDG to differentiate between inflammation and lung carcinoma in mice.Sixty-four C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 2x10(6) LLC1 lung carcinoma cells in the right hind flank on day 0 and were then injected with 0.1 mL turpentine in the left thigh muscle on day 3. The progress of inflammation and tumor in mice was longitudinally monitored by FDG/microPET. The biodistribution study, pharmacokinetic evaluation and whole-body autoradiography of FET and FDG were performed on day 8 after tumor inoculation.The FDG uptakes in tumor and inflammatory lesions were 4.42-fold and 3.53-fold (n = 4) higher, respectively, than that in muscle at 90 min post-injection and the tumor-to-inflammation ratio was 1.25. For FET/microPET, the tumor uptake was 2.07-fold and 2.07-fold (n = 4) higher than those in muscle and inflammatory lesions at 90 min post-injection, respectively. The distribution half-life (t1/2,alpha) and the elimination half-life (t1/2,beta) of FET were 39 min and 205 min, respectively, in mice.FDG delineated both tumor and inflammation, while FET accumulated in tumor to a significantly higher extent. Our results demonstrated the potential of FET to distinguish epidermoid lung carcinoma from inflammatory lesions in mice.
