Evaluation of cerebral blood perfusion in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy using densitometric analysis of conventional cranial CT. To evaluate the efficacy of densitometric analysis of cranial CT imaging in the measurement of areas with low cerebral blood flow and lack of hemodynamic reserve in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.40 consecutive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy have been included in the study. All of them had preoperative cranial CT, pre and postoperative basal and acetazolamide SPECT. Cranial CT imaging after digitalization and computer processing were obtained with 4 densitometric patterns: 1). normal cerebral blood perfusion 2). ischemic or low brain blood perfusion (patron I)32 out of 40 (80 %) patients had abnormal densitometric patterns: 19 nR patterns (47.5 %), 11 I pattern (27.5 %) and 2 established brain infarction. The correlation between densitometric cranial TC imaging and SPECT was 92% when analyzing areas with hypoperfusion (S: 96.5 % E: 82 %). Cranial CT detected 12/13 of patients who lacked cerebral hemodynamic reserve in the SPECT analysis (S: 74 %There is a good correlation between analysis of densitometric cranial TC imaging and SPECT in determining low cerebral blood flow areas and lack of cerebral hemodynamic reserve. This method could help to improve carotid surgery indications in patients with carotid stenosis.
