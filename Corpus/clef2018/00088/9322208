Comparison between qualitative and quantitative wall motion analyses using dipyridamole stress breath-hold cine magnetic resonance imaging in patients with severe coronary artery stenosis. Breath-hold cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at rest and during dipyridamole infusion was used to study wall motion abnormalities in patients with severe coronary artery stenosis proven by coronary angiography. Sixteen patients without myocardial infarction but at least one major coronary artery with > or = 70% diameter narrowing were included. Qualitative "visual" assessment of wall motion, as well as quantitative measurement "wall thickening changes (%)" were compared using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. 201Tl-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was also studied for comparison. Using qualitative analysis, coronary artery disease detection rate was comparable when assessing wall motion abnormalities with dipyridamole-MRI (79%) and with dipyridamole-induced perfusion defects with 201-thallium-SPECT (75%). Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity for identification of all diseased coronary territories were comparable for both imaging modalities (sensitivity of dipyridamole-MRI and 201thallium-SPECT, 80% vs. 69% specificity, 75% vs. 80%). The quantitative method has a substantially higher sensitivity than the qualitative method in identifying all diseased territories (Az = 0.81, p < 0.01 vs. Az = 0.55 and 0.59). In addition, we demonstrated that the quantitative method had higher performance than the qualitative one in identifying the diseased vessels territories related to 1-vessel, 2-vessel, and each of individual coronary artery stenoses.
