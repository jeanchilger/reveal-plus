Quantitative analysis of gated SPECT images using an efficient physical deformation model. In this paper, we present quantitative analysis of cardiac images using an efficient physical deformation model to evaluate ventricular function. By using this model we can accurately and efficiently compute ventricular volume, myocardial mass, endo- and epi-cardial wall motions and wall thickness over a full cardiac cycle. Patients with cardiac diseases were studied in our modeling and measurement framework using gated single-photon emission computed tomographic images. The results show that quantitative analysis using the model is very useful for the assessment of the extent and severity of myocardial ischemia or infarction. And it could be helpful to improve the decision-making process in the treatment of patients with cardiac diseases.
