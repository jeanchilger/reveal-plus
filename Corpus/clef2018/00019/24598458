Pediatric laparo-endoscopic single site partial nephrectomy: feasibility in infants and small children for upper urinary tract duplication anomalies. To assess the feasibility and outcomes of laparo-endoscopic single site (LESS) partial nephrectomy (PN) in infants and small children for upper urinary tract duplication anomalies.The medical records of all patients undergoing LESS PN at a single pediatric institution were retrospectively reviewed for patient demographics, perioperative details, and outcomes. A cystoscopy was initially performed to place an externalized catheter into the ureter of the ipsilateral normal renal moiety. An Olympus TriPort, an Olympus Endoeye flexible tip laparoscope, standard 3- or 5-mm instrumentation, and a LigaSure Blunt were utilized.Four children (two boys, two girls) underwent LESS PN. Three patients underwent upper pole PN and one underwent lower pole PN. All procedures were performed for poorly functioning obstructed renal moieties (one ureterocele, one ureteropelvic junction obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux, and two ectopic ureters). Median age was 6.2 months (range 2.5-16.4 months). Median weight was 7.7 kg (range 6.1-12.6 kg). Median operative time was 126 min (range 97-180 min). No patient received inpatient postoperative narcotics. Median follow-up was 9.9 months (range 6.2-19.1 months). No postoperative complications were noted. Postoperative renal ultrasound demonstrated successful resection in all patients.LESS PN is technically feasible, safe, and effective for upper urinary tract duplication anomalies in infants and small children.
