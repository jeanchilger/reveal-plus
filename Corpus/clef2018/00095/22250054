Expert dialogue: neuroendocrine tumours of the lungs and gastroenteropancreatic system. Neuroendocrine tumours of the lung exhibit an increasing incidence and prevalence. However, data on the diagnosis of and therapy for these tumours are sparse compared to neuroendocrine tumours of the gastroenteropancreatic system.The present article reflects a dialogue between experts on neuroendocrine tumors of the lung and the gastroenteropancreatic system held on February 25th and 26th in Weimar, Germany.Many similarities exist between neuroendocrine tumours of the lung and the gastroenteropancreatic system but there are also significant differences. Similarities exist mainly concerning pathology, diagnosis and therapy. Differences exist regarding the systemic therapy and the significantly lower incidence of paraneoplastic syndromes. Somatostatin receptor PET/CT with gallium-68 labelled somatostatin analogues and peptide receptor radiotherapy are innovative methods for the diagnosis of and therapy for neuroendocrine tumours of the lung. The first treatment option remains complete resection of the tumour. Small molecules like everolimus (Afinitor®) have been tested in clinical trials and have been shown to prolong progression-free survival.Additional studies are necessary and efforts should be undertaken to establish a registry to increase data on methods suitable for he diagnosis of and therapy for neuroendocrine tumours of the lung.
