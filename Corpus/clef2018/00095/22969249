Suppressive effect of 19-nor-1α-25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 on gastric cancer cells and peritoneal metastasis model. The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (calcitriol), inhibits the growth of several types of human cancer cells in vitro, but its therapeutic use is limited because it causes hypercalcemia. Among its analogs, 19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(2) (paricalcitol), has fewer calcemic effects and exhibits an activity equipotent to that of calcitriol. We assessed the antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects of paricalcitol in gastric cancer cells, and evaluated the potential role of vitamin D in the treatment of peritoneal metastatic gastric cancer. In this study, treatment with paricalcitol inhibited gastric cancer cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest. Paricalcitol also induced apoptosis and showed anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, the growth of intraperitoneal metastases in vivo was reduced in mice treated with paricalcitol. (18)F-FDG uptake was significantly lower in the paricalcitol group compared to control group (SUV control group 13.2 ± 5.3 vs paricalcitol group 4.5 ± 3.0). Intraperitoneal tumor volume was significantly lower in paricalcitol treated mice (control group 353.2 ± 22.9 mm(3) vs paricalcitol group 252.0 ± 8.4 mm(3)). These results suggest that the vitamin D analog, paricalcitol, has anticancer activity on gastric cancer cells by regulation of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and inflammation.
