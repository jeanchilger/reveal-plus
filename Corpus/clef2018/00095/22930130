The prevalence of metal-based drugs as therapeutic or diagnostic agents: beyond platinum. Metal complexes and metal salts have a wide range of medicinal applications and are extensively administered to patients or purchased over the counter as a matter of routine. The abundance and variety of non-platinum metal complexes, which are approved for use as therapeutic or diagnostic agents, are highlighted. Current insights into the mechanism of action or indeed lack thereof of a selection of metallodrugs are discussed. Ultimately this perspective seeks to inspire chemists to tackle new challenges and raise awareness of opportunities in the area of inorganic therapeutic and diagnostic medicine.
