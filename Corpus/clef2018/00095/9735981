Tc-99m MIBI thoracic SPECT for the detection of intrathoracic tumor masses. Thirty-one men (age range, 46-76 years mean age, 64.8 years) with intrathoracic masses suggesting possible malignancy on the basis of chest radiography or CT underwent preoperative Tc-99m MIBI SPECT examinations. Diagnosis was confirmed on pathologic examinations of samples obtained either at thoracotomy, esophagectomy, or by biopsy. Twenty-five patients had primary lung cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. Two patients had lymphomas with spread to the mediastinum, and three patients had extrathoracic primary cancers (one squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus, one squamous cell carcinoma originating from a head and neck tumor, and one metastatic mediastinal leiomyosarcoma). One patient with a tuberculoma had negative results of the Tc-99m MIBI examination. Tc-99m MIBI had a 86.7% sensitivity rate, a 0% false-positive rate, and a 100% positive predictive value to detect malignant intrathoracic masses. There was a 13% false-negative rate, however, suggesting that MIBI-SPECT may underdiagnose malignant lesions. SPECT findings of these 31 patients can be classified as 1) mass with increased uptake, n = 23
