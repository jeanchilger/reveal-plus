Paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia in antiphospholipid syndrome. We report on a patient with a mixed movement disorder classifiable as a paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia, occurring as the first manifestation of primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS). Possible pathophysiology is discussed based on recent literature, and we stress that PAPS must be considered in movement disorders of a paroxysmal nature.
