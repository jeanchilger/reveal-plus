Various imaging modalities for the detection of salivary gland lesions: the advantages of 201Tl SPET. The aim of this study was to compare dual-isotope (99Tc(m) and 201Tl) SPET imaging with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the differentiation of various lesions of the major salivary glands. Twenty-two patients underwent dual-isotope SPET imaging, of whom 12 also had CT and 15 also had an MRI study. The uptake ratio and retention index for 99Tc(m) and 201Tl were calculated by drawing regions of interest on the involved and normal glands. Both CT and MRI were interpreted by two radiologists. All malignant tumours were detected by all three modalities. Warthin's tumours were detected by dual-isotope SPET imaging however, MRI failed to differentiate Warthin's tumour from pleomorphic adenoma. Of 13 other benign tumours, dual-isotope SPET correctly diagnosed 12. Of 16 tumours showing a cold defect on the 99Tc(m) images, parametric analysis with 201Tl gave an accuracy of 94%, whereas CT gave an accuracy of 70-90%. MRI was 73-91% accurate in differentiating between benign (Warthin's) and malignant tumours. We believe that dual-isotope SPET imaging (99Tc(m) and 201Tl), together with semi-quantitative analysis, is the method of choice for differentiating between various lesions of the major salivary glands.
