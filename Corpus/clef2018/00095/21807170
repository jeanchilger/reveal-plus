Adrenal masses in children. Adrenal tumors include those of neural and cortical origin. Although most neuroblastomas present as abdominal masses, pheochromocytomas and cortical tumors usually present with endocrine dysfunction. Although imaging may not be able to differentiate benign lesions from malignant tumors, or whether they arise in the adrenal medulla or cortex, imaging is useful in determining the extent of the lesion and its relation to surrounding anatomic structures, particularly to vessels. Regardless of what imaging modality is used, meticulous attention to technique is required.
