19F 2-FDG NMR imaging of the brain in rat. Images of the rat head reflecting glucose utilization were obtained using 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-FDG) and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. Spatial heterogeneity of glucose utilization in the rat head was clearly demonstrated showing significantly higher glucose utilization in the brain as compared to the surrounding tissues. Although the potential adverse effects of the high doses of 2-FDG (400 mg/kg) needed to perform the study preclude immediate application of this technique to clinical quantitative glucose utilization studies, the present study shows potential for future development of glucose utilization imaging by NMR.
