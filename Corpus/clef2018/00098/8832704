18F]fluoroalkyl analogues of the potent 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635: radiosyntheses and in vivo evaluatio. Two analogues of the potent 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 have been synthesized and radiolabelled with 18F, namely N-[2-[4-(2-2'-[18F] fluoroethoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohe xan e carboxamide ([18F]FEC) and N-[2-[4-(2-3'-[18F] fluoropropoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cycloh exa ne carboxamide ([18F]FPC). Biodistribution studies in rats showed selective uptake of both radiotracers in regions known to be rich in 5-HT1A receptors following i.v. injection. The ratio of radioactivity in hippocampus to that in the cerebellum was 5.5 (for [18F]FEC) and 7.5 (for [18F]FPC) at 60 min postinjection. Regional brain heterogeneity of radioactivity could be abolished by pretreatment with WAY 100635 and FPC but was unaffected by pretreatment with a variety of drugs including ketanserin, sulpiride, and SCH 23390. These results are compared vis-a-vis with those obtained using [11C]WAY 100635 to evaluate [18F]FEC and [18F]FPC as potential radiotracers for imaging 5-HT1A receptors by positron emission tomography.
