Intracranial pressure, conductance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow, and cerebral blood flow in patients with benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). Intracranial pressure, conductance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow, and cerebral blood flow were investigated in 14 patients with benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). Intracranial pressure was increased in 9 patients (20 to 30 mm Hg), borderline in 4 patients (15 to 18 mm Hg), and normal in 1 patient (8 mm Hg). Six patients had plateau waves, and all had B waves in more than 50% of the monitored time. Conductance to cerebrospinal fluid outflow, measured by a lumbo-lumbar perfusion method, was significantly reduced: 0.042 ml X mm Hg-1 X min-1 (+/- 0.004 [SEM] normal, more than 0.080 ml X mm Hg-1 X min-1). Cerebral blood flow was measured by xenon 133 inhalation and single photon emission computer tomography. Mean hemispheric flow was normal in all cases, averaging 59 +/- 9 ml X 100 gm-1 X min-1. Only 2 patients showed focal low-flow areas. Thus, a disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid circulation seems to be of pathogenetic significance in benign intracranial hypertension.
