Functional neuroimaging in the postictal state. The postictal state is defined as manifestation of seizure-induced reversible alterations in neuronal function, but not structure. Following a seizure, it is common to experience feelings of exhaustion, both mental and physical, that can last a day or two. There are three major hypotheses regarding what cellular and molecular mechanisms could cause the observed postictal symptoms: neurotransmitter depletion or changes in receptor concentration, active inhibition, and cerebral blood flow changes. Here, we describe the contributions of functional neuroimaging studies to the understanding of postictal symptoms.
