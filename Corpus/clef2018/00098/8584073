Spectroscopic imaging of the brain. Examination technique and clinical applications. MR spectroscopy allows the acquisition of a two-dimensional array of spatially resolved proton spectra of the human brain, known as MR spectroscopic imaging. Here the examination protocol and clinical applications in focal brain lesions are presented.An array of data is acquired from a tissue slice positioned in the brain. These data can be presented as a set of spectra, in which each spectrum is allocated to a specific position in the sample, or as a set of images or "metabolite maps".The NAA signal typical for neuronal tissue is decreased in the centre of brain tumours as well as in brain infarcts. The intensity of the choline signal is increased in solid tumour tissue, whereas it is reduced in infarcts.Spectroscopic imaging reveals metabolite alterations in and around focal lesions. The spatial resolution of spectroscopic imaging enables matching with other macro-morphological or functional imaging methods like positron emission tomography.
