A new approach to position reconstruction in TOFPET. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is a state-of-the-art technique in designing sophisticated apparatus for various applications in science and technology. We adopted MCS based on GEANT (GEometry ANd Tracking) in order to design a simple time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOFPET). In MCS studies, a new method of position reconstruction of positron-electron annihilation points has been developed so far. Simulation results show that this technique may not be useful for small animal imaging camera but might be practicable in diagnostic TOFPET camera. Specific issue of this simulation technique is discussed.
