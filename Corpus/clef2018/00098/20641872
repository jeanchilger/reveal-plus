1-[4-(3-[ Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease associated with an irreversible decline of mental functions and with cognitive impairment (1, 2). It is characterized by the presence, in the brain, of senile plaques of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides with intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of filaments containing the hyperphosphorylated protein tau (3, 4). Accelerated deposition of Aβ deposits seems to be a key risk factor associated with AD, and although the mechanisms of the disease are still not fully understood, reducing the deposition of amyloid plaques seems to benefit patients. Several radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed (5-7) and tested in humans as
