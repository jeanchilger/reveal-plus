Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography improves preoperative staging of resectable lung metastasis. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is now a procedure of proven clinical value in the staging of primary lung cancer. This study evaluated the role of PET in the preoperative assessment of resectable lung metastases.Eighty-six patients with previously treated malignancy and proven or suspected lung metastases, deemed resectable at computed tomography scan, were investigated with 89 preoperative PET procedures. Primary tumor sites were: gastrointestinal in 32 cases, sarcoma in 13, urologic in 14, breast in 8, head and neck in 7, gynecologic in 5, thymus in 5, other in 5. Seventy lung resections were performed in 68 patients of whom only 54 proved to be lung metastasis, 7 were primary lung tumors, and 9 were benign lesions.In 19 cases (21%) lung surgery was excluded on the basis of PET scan results due to extrapulmonary metastases (11 cases), primary site recurrence (2), mediastinal adenopathy (2), or benign disease (4). All mediastinal node metastases (7 cases) were detected by PET with a sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value for mediastinal staging of 100%, 96%, and 100%, respectively, versus 71%, 92%, and 95% of the computed tomography scan. In the group of patients who underwent lung resection, PET sensitivity for detection of lung metastasis was 87%.PET scan proved to be a valuable staging procedure in patients with clinically resectable lung metastasis and changed the therapeutic management in a high proportion of cases.
