Age and regional cerebral blood flow in schizophrenia: age effects in anterior cingulate, frontal, and parietal cortex. Positron emission tomography ([(15)O] water PET) was used to examine the relationship between age and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in schizophrenia. Forty-nine unmedicated male patients, ages 20-51, underwent imaging during an eyes-closed resting condition. Negative correlations were observed between age and rCBF in the anterior cingulate, as well as in frontal (Brodmann area 8) and parietal cortex (area 40) bilaterally. The observation of reduced rCBF in the anterior cingulate with increased age is consistent with previous findings in healthy subjects. In contrast, the reduced flow observed in the frontal and parietal regions may be unique to schizophrenia.
