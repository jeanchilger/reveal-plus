Spontaneous improvement in reduced vasodilatory capacity in major cerebral arterial occlusive disease. Reduced vasodilatory capacity resulting from occlusive lesions of the major cerebral arteries may return to normal without surgical revascularisation. We aimed to determine prospectively the frequency and predictors of recovery of impaired haemodynamics as demonstrated by acetazolamide (ACZ) reactivity on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Vasoreactivity was measured by (123)I-IMP SPECT with an ACZ challenge, in 37 medically treated patients with unilateral occlusive disease of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery at an interval of 1-2 years. Each ACZ challenge test was analysed semiquantitatively by calculating the degree of increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) asymmetry after ACZ administration (DeltaAI). Vasodilatory capacity was abnormal initially in 20 patients (65 %) eight of whom (40 %) exhibited spontaneous normalisation on follow-up. Although the baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between patients with or without increase in reactivity, logistic regression analysis revealed that the initial DeltaAI (P < 0.05) and the type of vascular lesion (stenosis or occlusion) (P < 0.05) correlated significantly with a return towards normal of reduced ACZ reactivity. Spontaneous improvement of impaired vasodilatory capacity may not be a rare phenomenon. We found that mild reduction in the initial ACZ reactivity and a stenosis, but not complete occlusion, were independent factors contributing to normalisation of impaired cerebral haemodynamics.
