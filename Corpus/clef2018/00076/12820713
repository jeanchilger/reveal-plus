Staging tools for nonsmall cell lung cancer. Accurate staging remains the cornerstone of initial managment of nonsmall cell lung cancer. CT offers the potential advantage of identifying early stage tumors when broadly applied as a screening tool, although studies that are evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, and impact on survival are ongoing. PET is a functional imaging tool with ever-broadening applications. New techniques, such as CT-PET fusion imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, virtual bronchoscopy, and three-dimensional volumetric reconstruction may further refine noninvasive diagnostic and staging options.
