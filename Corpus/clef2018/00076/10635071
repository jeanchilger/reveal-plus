Role of video-thoracoscopy in the pretreatment evaluation of lung carcinoma. Lung cancer is the first cause of cancer mortality in male patients in France. Treatment varies depending on the histological type and the disease extent at diagnosis.Videothoracoscopic staging appears to be an accurate method to assess the stage of lung cancer to guide rational management as it allows for 1) an accurate tissue diagnosis when standard methods failed, 2) the identification of a parietal or mediastinal invasion when suspected by CT-scan findings, 3) lymph node sampling of sites that are poorly or not reachable with mediastinoscopy, 4) the diagnosis of pleural or pericardial metastases in patients with effusion or indeterminate nodules, and finally 5) the conclusive answer to the diagnostic dilemma caused by the presence of a contralateral pulmonary nodule in patients with a potentially curable tumor.Video-assisted thoracoscopy thus appears to have a complementary role in intrathoracic lung cancer staging when conventional methods are equivocal. Its main side-advantage is the opportunity to proceed without delay to the surgical treatment, when appropriate, in the same operative settings, or to perform in the same session various procedures, i.e., talc poudrage and pericardial window, to palliate adverse symptoms occurring in some of those patients. Obviously, equally efficient and less invasive approaches should have been considered previously. To date, however, videothoracoscopic evaluation of tumor resectability is not achievable. Finally, one may suppose that positron emission tomography will probably reduce the role of those invasive surgical procedures in a near future.
