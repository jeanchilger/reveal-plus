Imaging and biomarkers in early Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. A major focus of research on aging and dementia pertains to the prediction of future cognitive decline. Toward this end, several longitudinal studies are under way that are designed to explore early predictors of cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging techniques and biomarkers have shown promise in this application. Ultimately, it is likely that the use of a combination of neuroimaging and chemical biomarkers will be involved in predicting the development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
