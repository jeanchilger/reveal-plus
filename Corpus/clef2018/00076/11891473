Estimation of left ventricular systolic pressure by the left ventricular volume-time curve obtained from electrocardiograph gated 99m Tc-tetrofosmin single photon emission tomography using quantitative gated SPECT. We report the estimation of left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) by a left ventricular (LV) volume-time curve obtained from electrocardiogram (ECG) gated 99mTc-tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using quantitative gated SPECT (QGS). LVSP was calculated based on the following parameters: LV volumes, velocity and acceleration of LV contraction, aortic valve area and density of blood. The first three parameters can be derived from ECG gated SPECT. In 16 patients, the LV volume-time curve was obtained from ECG gated SPECT by using QGS. LVSP was estimated by the above-mentioned theory. The values of estimated peak LVSP were compared with those measured from a pressure transducer. There was a correlation between the values of peak LVSP estimated by the LV volume-time curve and those measured by pressure transducer (r=0.69, P<0.01). Using QGS, LVSP and the systolic LV pressure-volume relationship could be estimated by the LV volume-time curve.
