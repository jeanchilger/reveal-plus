99mTc glucarate high-resolution imaging of drug sensitive and drug resistant human breast cancer xenografts in SCID mice. Previous studies have showed that 99mTc labelled glucarate (GLA) might be an agent for non-invasive detection of breast tumours. In xenografted BT20 breast tumours, GLA was found to have higher uptake than 99mTc sestamibi (MIBI). It is unclear whether GLA can localize in all cell line breast cancer xenografts, as well as breast tumours with multidrug resistance (MDR). The present study aimed to investigate the properties of GLA in detecting drug sensitive and drug resistant MCF7 breast cancer xenografts in mice by using dynamic single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging.MCF7/S cells are drug sensitive breast carcinoma cells. MCF7/D40 cells are 40-fold more resistant to doxorubicin compared to MCF7/S. Subcutaneous tumours were grown in SCID mice for 10-14 days after injection of 1 x 10(6) cells into the right thigh. Anaesthetized mice with MCF7/S (MIBI, n=9 GLA, n=8) and MCF7/D40 (MIBI, n=6The xenografted tumours were visualized unequivocally within 10-30 min in GLA images and remained detectable for at least 2 h after injection. Drug resistant tumours, from which MIBI was rapidly expelled, retained GLA as readily as did drug sensitive tumours. The biodistribution data of GLA demonstrated significantly higher accumulation (%ID/g) compared to MIBI.MCF7 tumour xenografts can be detected by 99mTc glucarate imaging. More importantly, 99mTc glucarate can potentially localize drug resistant breast tumours.
