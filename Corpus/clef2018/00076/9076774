Synthesis of isomers of 18F-labelled amino acid radiopharmaceutical: position 2- and 3-L-18F-alpha-methyltyrosine using a separation and purification system. To diagnose cancers with radiolabelled amino acid using positron emission tomography, we have constructed a separation and purification system for the production of L-18F-alpha-methyltyrosine (L-18FAmT). This system could provide radioprotection and consistent production of L-18FAmT. L-18FAmT was synthesized and purified and the efficiency of the system was examined. The radiochemical yield of L-18FAmT was 20.3 +/- 5.1% (n = 5) based on the radioactivity trapped in the reaction vessel. The radiochemical purity was greater than 99.4 +/- 0.3% (n = 5). The radiochemical stability in phosphate-buffered saline and human plasma was examined and little decomposition was observed by HPLC analysis. Our results indicate that the separation and purification system gave simple and quick synthesis of L-18FAmT with a large reduction in radiation exposure and consistent production of L-18FAmT.
