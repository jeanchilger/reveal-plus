Postoperative venous thrombosis. Evaluation of five methods of treatment. Five methods for preventing deep venous thrombosis in postoperative patients were evaluated and compared with a control group. Five hundred patients from five surgical specialties were studied. The incidence of deep venous thrombosis was 37.3 percent in the control group but significantly less within all treatment groups. The minidose heparin group had the highest incidence (26.9 percent) because there were a large number of bilateral thromboses. The antistasis modalities did slightly better than the drugs the intermittent pneumatic compression group had the fewest thromboses (11.9 percent). The significant risk factors for postoperative deep venous thrombosis are (1) obesity, (2) malignancy, (3) a history of venous disease, major surgery or major fracture, (4) length of surgery greater than 1 hour, and (5) increasing age. Four nonfatal pulmonary emboli occurred in 500 patients. Two were in women with hysterectomies in whom thrombosis had never been detected in an extremity
