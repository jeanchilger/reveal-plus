Contribution of real time echotomography to evaluation of cervico-encephalic atheromatous disease. Real time ultrasonography can now provide fine, easily reproducible images of the carotid arteries and to a lesser degree the vertebral arteries. The method is a simple one but requires an experienced operator. Care should be taken to visualize mainly the zones of predilection of the atheroma (carotid bifurcation and ostia). Even minimal sized atheromatous plaques can be detected, including those that are frequently asymptomatic to the doppler test, and their calcareous, regular, or ulcerated nature can be determined. The limits of the examination are described, demonstrating the need for complementary ultrasound and doppler tests. The two main poles of interest of this vascular imaging are early detection of carotid atheroma and supervision of medical and surgical treatments.
