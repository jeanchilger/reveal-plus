Dopamine enhancement of the cerebral microcirculation in a local ischemic lesion. The effect of dopamine on the local cerebral blood flow in parietal brain cortex region of rats was studied in conditions of local ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Registration of the local cerebral blood flow was performed on a ALF-21 laser doppler flowmeter ("Transonic System Inc.", USA). Dopamine produces a pronounced effect on cerebral circulation in conditions of local brain ischemia thus causing a significant increase in blood flow both in ischemic and intact hemispheres. The effect is observed both in the acute stage of ischemic brain injury and in the remote period of brain ischemia.
