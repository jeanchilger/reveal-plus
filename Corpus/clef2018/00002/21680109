Contribution of new MRI sequences in the exploration of the pelvic gynaecological disease. MRI has emerged for several years as the imaging examination of second-line indications in the majority of female pelvic imaging, after ultrasonography. Recent technical advances have allowed the widespread use of new MRI sequences, allowing a morphological and functional analysis of the pelvic organs. Diffusion weighted-imaging has a definite interest for the detection, characterization and staging of uterine and adnexal lesions. Dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging is an essential tool for characterizing adnexal lesions and to optimize the staging of uterine cancers. The 3D morphological imaging allows multiplanar reconstructions and is particularly useful in mapping fibroids, uterine malformations and in endometriosis.
