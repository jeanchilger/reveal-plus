Could induced apoptosis of human granulosa cells predict in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer outcome? A preliminary study of 25 women. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between induced apoptosis of human luteinized granulosa cells (GCs) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome.We induced apoptosis with interferon gamma and an anti-human Fas antibody in cultured GCs isolated from follicular fluids coming from 25 different women undergoing 25 consecutive IVF cycles. After examination of 1000 GCs stained by DAPI with a fluorescent microscope, we determined the percentages of apoptotic GCs. Ovarian, endometrial and IVF parameters were recorded for every woman.We classified the women according to their induced GCs apoptosis percentages in two groups. Group 1 with a low percentage of apoptotic GCs (11.6+/-4.8%) had a significantly higher pregnancy rate (P<0.05) than group 2 with a high percentage of apoptotic GCs (59.5+/-14.8%). No other statistically significant differences were observed.Resistance of human GCs to apoptosis might be implicated in IVF outcome.
