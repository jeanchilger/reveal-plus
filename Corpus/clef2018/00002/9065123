Increased levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 in the peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis. The levels of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were measured in the peritoneal fluid of 15 patients with endometriosis to characterize the type of immune response that occurs at the site of endometriosis.Cytokine levels in peritoneal fluid obtained during laparoscopy from 15 patients and 12 controls undergoing tubal ligation were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The mean levels of interleukin-6 in patients with endometriosis and controls were 797 +/- 407 pg/ml and 133 +/- 38 pg/ml, respectively (p < 0.02). Similarly, the mean concentration of interleukin-10 in peritoneal fluids of patients with endometriosis was significantly higher than that of controls (241 +/- 38 vs 128 +/- 21, p < 0.05). The levels of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were not significantly different between the two study groups.The levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 are increased in the peritoneal fluids of patients with endometriosis, suggesting enhanced macrophage activity in these patients. Increased interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 production may partially contribute to the disturbed immune regulation observed in patients with endometriosis.
