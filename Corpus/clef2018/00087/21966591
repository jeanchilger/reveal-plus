Revisiting the Marrow Metabolic Changes after Chemotherapy in Lymphoma: A Step towards Personalized Care. Purpose. The aims were to correlate individual marrow metabolic changes after chemotherapy with bone marrow biopsy (BMBx) for its potential value of personalized care in lymphoma. Methods. 26 patients (mean age, 58 ± 15 y 13 female, 13 male) with follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, referred to FDG-PET/CT imaging, who had BMBx from unilateral or bilateral iliac crest(s) before chemotherapy, were studied retrospectively. The maximal standardized uptake value (SUV) was measured from BMBx site over the same area on both initial staging and first available restaging FDG-PET/CT scan. Results. 35 BMBx sites in 26 patients were evaluated. 12 of 35 sites were BMBx positive with interval decrease in SUV in 11 of 12 sites (92%). The remaining 23 of 35 sites were BMBx negative with interval increase in SUV in 21 of 23 sites (91%). The correlation between SUV change over the BMBx site before and after chemotherapy and BMBx result was significant (P < 0.0001). Conclusions. This preliminary result demonstrates a strong correlation between marrow metabolic changes (as determined by FDG PET) after chemotherapy and bone marrow involvement proven by biopsy. This may provide a retrospective means of personalized management of marrow involvement in deciding whether to deliver more extended therapy or closer followup of lymphoma patients.
