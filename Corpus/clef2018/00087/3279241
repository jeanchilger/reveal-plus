Positron emission tomography in oncology. Council on Scientific Affairs. This report describes the current and potential uses of positron emission tomography in clinical medicine and research related to oncology. Assessment will be possible of metabolism and physiology of tumors and their effects on adjacent tissues. Specific probes are likely to be developed for target sites on tumors, including monoclonal antibodies and specific growth factors that recognize tumors. To date, most oncological applications of positron emission tomography tracers have been qualitative in the future, quantitative metabolic measurements should aid in the evaluation of tumor biology and response to treatment.
