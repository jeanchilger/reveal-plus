Clinical features and imaging findings of posterior cerebral artery infarction. The clinical features and imaging findings of posterior cerebral artery infarction (PCAI) in 18 cases verified by CT scan and/or MRI, DSA, SPECT were reported, and their interrelation were analyzed. It was found that the main clinical feature of PCAI was visual defect with amnesia syndrome, the lesion was predominant in the right hemisphere. In examining the structure and function of brain and vessels, each of CT, MRI, ECT and DSA had its own advantage and might complement the others, CT and MRI were better in displaying the structure of cerebral parenchyma than ECT and DSA, whereas, MRI was superior in distinguishing the lesions in deep white matter and subtentorial region. DSA was better than MRI and CT in displaying vascular structure, but was inferior in disclosing the occlusion of deep perforating branches or cortical arterioles. ECT, besides its ability to show the morphological changes of brain, was mainly used to disclose the functional changes of cerebral parenchyma, being a method to make early diagnosis for CVD. However, ECT was inferior than MRI and CT, in displaying lacunar infarction and lesions of brain-stem.
