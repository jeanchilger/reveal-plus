Regional cerebral blood flow measurement with iodine-123-IMP autoradiography: normal values, reproducibility and sensitivity to hypoperfusion. We recently proposed a simplified technique for measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using the [123I]N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) autoradiographic (ARG) method with SPECT (the IMP-ARG method). We examined normal values of rCBF and the reproducibility and sensitivity to hypoperfusion in stroke patients using this method.By using a standard arterial input, a single static scan, a fixed distribution volume (Vd) and one-point arterial blood sampling, we measured rCBF in 39 normal volunteers (19 men and 20 women mean ages 61 +/- 11 yr for the men and 60 +/- 12 yr for the women). Eighteen neurologically stable patients with prior stroke (mean age = 65 +/- 11 yr) were studied twice at a mean interval of 97 days. In 16 patients (7 men and 9 women, mean age = 63 +/- 5 yr) with subarachnoid hemorrhage, rCBF was measured 1-2 wk after onset. Cerebral vasospasm was evaluated by repeated angiography. The mean rCBF in the vasospastic area was compared with that in a nonvasospastic area.The mean rCBFs of the cerebral cortex and centrum semiovale in the volunteers were 33.0 +/- 5.1 ml/100 g/min and 25.0 +/- 4.5 ml/100 g/min, respectively. There was no age-dependent change in rCBF, but the women showed significantly higher cortical rCBF than the men (p < 0.05). In the stroke patients, the whole-brain CBF values showed high reproducibility, with high correlations between those obtained at the first and second studies (y = -3.5 + 1.03x r = 0.90The IMP-ARG method is reproducible, sensitive to hypoperfusion and feasible for the quantitative evaluation of rCBF in routine clinical practice.
