Whole-body (18)F-FDG PET and conventional imaging for predicting outcome in previously treated breast cancer patients. This study was conducted to determine the ability of (18)F-FDG PET and conventional imaging (CI) to predict the outcomes in breast cancer patients who have previously undergone primary treatment.The study population consisted of 61 female patients (median age, 54 y range, 32--91 y) who were reevaluated with (18)F-FDG PET and CI after treatment. The median interval between the last treatment and PET was 0.4 y (range, 0--16 y). PET was performed within 3 mo of CI (median interval, 25 dOf 61 patients, 19 (31.1%) had no clinical evidence and 38 (62.3%) had evidence of residual or recurrent disease by the end of follow-up. Four patients (6.6%) had died. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) of PET were 93% and 84%, respectively. CI yielded a PPV of 85% and an NPV of 59%. The prognostic accuracy of single whole-body PET was superior to that of multiple procedures with CI (90% vs. 75% P < 0.05). Kaplan--Meier estimates of disease-free survival in patients with negative PET findings compared with those with positive PET findings revealed a significant difference between the 2 curves (log-rank test = 0.001). Kaplan--Meier estimates of disease-free survival stratified by CI results showed a marginally significant difference between CI-positive and CI-negative patients (log-rank test = 0.04).FDG PET can be used to improve prediction of the clinical outcome of previously treated breast cancer patients relative to what is achievable through CI alone.
