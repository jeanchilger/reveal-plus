The clinical role of CT/PET in oncology: an update. FDG-PET imaging has significantly altered the workup of the oncologic patient. With the introduction of combined FDG-PET/CT scanners, there has been a dramatic improvement in lesion detection, lesion characterization and accurate lesion localization. As attenuation correction can be attained with the CT images, PET exam times have been dramatically reduced, by as much as 50% in many instances. In this overview we briefly outline the advantages of CT/PET in oncology especially in diagnosis and clinical management of the common tumor types for which it is mainly used.
