Evaluation of fluoride-labeled boronophenylalanine-PET imaging for the study of radiation effects in patients with glioblastomas. Here we demonstrate that differentiation between glioblastoma (GB) tumor progression (TP) and radiation necrosis (RN) can be achieved with fluoride-labeled boronoalanine positron emission tomography (F-BPA-PET). F-BPA-PET images were obtained from histologically verified 38 GB, 8 complete RN, and 5 RN cases with partial residual tumors. The lesion/normal (L/N) ratios for these groups were 4.2 +/- 1.4, 1.5 +/- 0.3, and 2.0 +/- 0.3, respectively. Ten GB patients underwent F-BPA-PET twice (once before and once after radiation treatment) due to enlargement of the original lesion or the development of new lesions post radiation. The L/N ratios of ten original site lesions had decreased by the second PET, and these lesions were revealed to be RN. In contrast, the L/N ratios of two lesions distant from the original site increased, and these lesions were revealed as cases of TP. Repeat PET imaging was found to be useful for evaluating changes in GB-associated tumor activity with respect to the treatment received.
