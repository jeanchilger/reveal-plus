A comparison of chloroquine and pyrimethamine as malaria chemoprophylactics in young Nigerian children. The efficacy of chloroquine and pyrimethamine as malaria chemoprophylactics was investigated in young Nigerian children. Chloroquine resistance had not been documented in the study area pyrimethamine resistance was probably present but uncommon. Children who received weekly chemoprophylaxis with pyrimethamine had a lower prevalence of malaria parasitaemia and malaria antibodies than children who received weekly chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine. Pyrimethamine given monthly gave a comparable degree of protection to chloroquine given weekly. Chloroquine frequently induced vomiting in young children and this may have impaired its efficacy as a prophylactic. We conclude that, in an area where neither chloroquine nor pyrimethamine resistance is prevalent, pyrimethamine is a better chemoprophylactic for young children than chloroquine.
