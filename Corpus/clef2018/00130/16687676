Short report: Dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum malaria after sub-optimal therapy in Uganda. We followed parasite genotypes of 75 patients for 42 days after treatment of uncomplicated malaria with chloroquine + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Kampala, Uganda. Infections were complex (mean, 2.88 strains) and followed three patterns: 27% of patients eliminated all strains and remained parasite-free, 48% had a long aparasitemic interval followed by reappearance of original strains after 3-33 days (mean, 9.2 days), and 25% failed to clear original strains and required therapy after 3-35 days (mean, 17 days). These results highlight the complexity of malaria in Africa and have implications for efficacy trials, because missing late reappearances of strains could lead to misclassification of outcomes.
