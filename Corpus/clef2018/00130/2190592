Rapid colorimetric detection of in vitro amplified DNA sequences. A colorimetric assay to detect immobilized amplified nucleic acids has been designed. This approach provides a rapid assay, suitable for clinical diagnosis, to analyze DNA sequences amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The specific DNA sequences are captured on a solid support by the use of a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the Escherichia coli lac repressor and staphylococcal protein A. The biotin streptavidin system is used to detect the immobilized material. Positive samples can be analyzed by direct solid-phase sequencing. Here, we show that this nonradioactive concept can be used for analysis of Staphylococci and Streptococci and for specific detection of the protozoa Plasmodium falciparum in clinical samples.
