Ovarian carcinomas in endometriosis: an immunohistochemical and comparative genomic hybridization study. Malignant transformation of endometriosis, an uncommon phenomenon, can occur in gonadal and extragonadal sites and results in a wide histological range of tumors. Published series reporting malignant transformation of endometriosis have largely been confined to clinical and histopathological discussions with no studies reporting oncoprotein expression and genetic alterations. We report three cases of carcinomas arising in ovarian endometriosis: a serous cystadenocarcinoma, an endometrioid carcinoma with squamous differentiation, and a pure squamous cell carcinoma. Each tumor was analyzed immunohistochemically to compare oncoprotein expression (p53, bcl2, cyclin D1, and c-erb B2) between the tumors and the endometriotic tissue as well as with comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to compare genetic alterations. All three tumors expressed nuclear p53, in contrast to the endometriotic tissue in which no p53 expression was found. Both endometrial and tumor tissue expressed bcl-2. No expression of cyclin D1 or c-erb B2 was detected in endometriotic or tumoral tissues. The CGH analysis revealed one or two chromosomal aberrations in each of the three tumors with gains on chromosomes 1q, 8q, and 13q, and losses on chromosome 10p. The endometriotic tissue, as expected, showed a normal genetic profile. These results suggest that p53 protein abnormalities and chromosomal aberrations may be involved in malignant transformation of endometriosis in the ovary. However, our results are limited by the number of cases examined and a definite conclusion on the pathogenesis of this process should be followed by future studies with a larger number of cases.
