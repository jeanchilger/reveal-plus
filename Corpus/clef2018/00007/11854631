The significance of psammoma bodies that are found incidentally during endometrial biopsy. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the significance of psammoma bodies that are found incidentally during endometrial biopsy.We reviewed the medical records of 11 women who were found to have psammoma bodies during endometrial biopsy over an 18-month period and extracted data that included demographic information, extent of evaluation, and pathologic findings.Ten women were postmenopausal and underwent endometrial biopsy for abnormal uterine bleeding while using combined hormone replacement. Most women underwent dilation and curettage with hysteroscopy plus either laparoscopy or ultrasonography. Notable findings included: 5 women with endometrial polyps, 2 women with endometriosis, 1 woman with endosalpingiosis, and 1 woman with a mature cystic teratoma. No endometrial or adnexal malignancies were identified.This series represents the largest series to date regarding psammoma bodies that have been found incidentally during endometrial biopsy. All psammoma bodies were associated with benign findings. Further evaluation of the endometrial cavity with hysteroscopy or sonohysterography, plus some form of adnexal assessment, is a reasonable definitive evaluation scheme.
