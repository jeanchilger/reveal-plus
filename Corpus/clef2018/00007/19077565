Expression profile of mammalian microRNAs in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs of 19-24 nucleotides in length and involved in gene expression regulation. They are associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. The specific expression profiles of miRNAs have been found in many human cancers, but there are few studies on endometrioid adenocarcinoma. We found the miRNA expression profile in 10 pairs of endometrioid adenocarcinoma and adjacent nontumorous endometrium using human miRNA microarray. Seventeen miRNAs exhibited higher expression and six miRNAs exhibited lower expression in endometrioid adenocarcinoma samples than those in the nontumorous samples in the microarray. Of those, the miR-205, miR-449, and miR-429 were greatly enriched in contrast the miR-204, miR-99b, and miR-193b were greatly downregulated in adenocarcinoma tissues. The expressions of these six miRNAs were validated using real time reverse transcription-PCR. This information may provide the candidate miRNA genome for further confirming the role of miRNAs in carcinogenesis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma and potentially serving as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool in endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
