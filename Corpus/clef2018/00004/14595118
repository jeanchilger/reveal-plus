Novel membrane protein shrew-1 targets to cadherin-mediated junctions in polarized epithelial cells. While searching for potential candidate molecules relevant for the pathogenesis of endometriosis, we discovered a 2910-base pair cDNA encoding a novel putative 411-amino acid integral membrane protein that we called shrew-1. The putative open-reading frame was confirmed with antibodies against shrew-1 peptides that labeled a protein of approximately 48 kDa in extracts of shrew-1 mRNA-positive tissue and also detected ectopically expressed shrew-1. Expression of epitope-tagged shrew-1 in epithelial cells and analysis by surface biotinylation and immunoblots demonstrated that shrew-1 is indeed a transmembrane protein. Shrew-1 is able to target to E-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions and interact with the E-cadherin-catenin complex in polarized MCF7 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, but not with the N-cadherin-catenin complex in nonpolarized epithelial cells. Direct interaction of shrew-1 with beta-catenin in in vitro pull-down assay suggests that beta-catenin might be one of the proteins that targets and/or retains shrew-1 in the adherens junctions. Interestingly, shrew-1 was partially translocated in response to scatter factor (ligand of receptor tyrosine kinase c-met) from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm where it still colocalized with endogenous E-cadherin. In summary, we introduce shrew-1 as a novel component of adherens junctions, interacting with E-cadherin-beta-catenin complexes in polarized epithelial cells.
