Measurement of serum and peritoneal fluid LH concentrations as a diagnostic tool for human endometriosis. A rapid, sensitive enzymeimmunoassay for the measurement of LH concentrations in serum and peritoneal fluid samples of healthy women and women with endometriosis is reported. The ligand (LH) was captured by a readily available, widely used and well-characterized monoclonal antibody (mAb, 518B7) generated against the beta subunit of bovine LH. This mAb, although specific for LH, shows very little species specificity and detects LH by radioimmunoassay in humans. A polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbits against hCG was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and was used as the second antibody signal. This anti-hCG antiserum crossreacts with LH. The enzymeimmunoassay uses the standard human LH (hLH) preparations (NIADDK-hLH-I-3, AFP-827OB) and results are based on the relative concentrations of LH in serum and peritoneal fluid. Total assay time was < 3 h. The range of the standard curve was 0.002-0.500 ng LH per well and the lowest concentration of hLH that could be distinguished from zero concentration was 0.15 +/- 0.02 ng ml(-1) serum and 0.058 +/- 0.021 ng ml(-1) peritoneal fluid. Clinical diagnostic parameters for the LH enzymeimmunoassay showed a sensitivity of 85.71%, specificity 92.50%, efficiency 88.54%, positive predictive value 94.11% and negative predictive value 82.22%. The study was retrospective. Serum LH concentrations of women with endometriosis were 13.67 +/- 7.21 ng ml(-1), whereas serum LH concentrations of women in the control group were 4.52 +/- 2.03 ng ml(-1). One-way ANOVA showed significant differences (P < 0.001) between women with endometriosis and control groups. Women in the control group had peritoneal fluid LH values of 5.65 +/- 2.43 ng ml(-1), whereas peritoneal fluid LH values of 64.06 +/- 16.44 ng ml(-1) were obtained in women with endometriosis (P < 0.001). A cycle-dependent pattern of serum and peritoneal fluid LH concentration was observed in women in the control group, which was not observed in the peritoneal fluid of the group with endometriosis. The application of this assay to serum or peritoneal fluid samples provides the attractive possibility that it could be included in the panel of markers used for diagnosis of endometriosis.
