Gene-based vaccines and immunotherapeutics. DNA vaccines, comprised of plasmid DNA encoding proteins from pathogens, allergens, and tumors, are being evaluated as prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic treatments for infectious diseases, allergies, and cancer plasmids encoding normal human proteins are likewise being tested as vaccines and treatments for autoimmune diseases. Examples of in vivo prophylaxis and immunotherapy, based on different types of immune responses (humoral and cellular), in a variety of disease models and under evaluation in early phase human clinical trials are presented. Viral vectors continue to show better levels of expression than those achieved by DNA plasmid vectors. We have focused our clinical efforts, at this time, on the use of recombinant viral vectors for both vaccine as well as cytokine gene transfer studies. We currently have four clinical programs in cancer immunotherapy. Two nonspecific immunotherapy programs are underway that apply adenoviral vectors for the transfer of cytokine genes into tumors in situ. An adenovirus-IFN gamma construct (TG1042) is currently being tested in phase II clinical trials in cutaneous lymphoma. A similar construct, adenovirus-IL2 (TG1024), also injected directly into solid tumors, is currently being tested in patients with solid tumors (about one-half of which are melanoma). Encouraging results are seen in both programs. Two cancer vaccine immunotherapy programs focus on two cancer-associated antigens: human papilloma virus E6 and E7 proteins and the epithelial cancer-associated antigen MUC1. Both are encoded by a highly attenuated vaccinia virus vector [modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)] and both are coexpressed with IL-2. Encouraging results seen in both of these programs are described.
