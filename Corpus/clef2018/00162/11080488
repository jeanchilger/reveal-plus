The human papillomavirus E7 protein is able to inhibit the antiviral and anti-growth functions of interferon-alpha. It is now well recognized that cervical cancer is caused by infection with certain human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes and while interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is used to treat HPV-infected lesions, HPV appears to have developed a means to avoid the effects of IFN-alpha. Clinically, resistance appears to be associated with the expression of the E7 oncoprotein. Here we investigated the effects of expression in cells of the E7 protein from high- and low-risk papillomavirus subtypes on a range of responses to IFN-alpha. 2fTGH, a cell line dependent on IFN-alpha for growth in selection medium, grew significantly less well in the presence of E7, and the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha upon epithelial cells was lost upon E7 expression. The antiviral effects of IFN-alpha were abrogated in E7-expressing cells. Loss of response to IFN-alpha was found to occur in both high- and low-risk papillomaviruses. Finally, deletion of amino acids 21-24 of HPV type 16 E7 protein partially reversed repression. We conclude that E7 inhibits the functional effects of IFN-alpha and that this property is shared by all HPV subtypes tested.
