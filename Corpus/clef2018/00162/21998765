Pediatric vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in a liver transplantation recipient: a case report. Here we report the first Korean case of a girl who developed noninvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva at the age of 16 years. She was taking tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive agent, after living-related liver transplantation. The vulvar masses were microscopically proved as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasm II and III, even squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Human papillomavirus subtypes (69 and 73) and human papillomavirus types (66, 70, 73, and 43) were detected in the vulvar mass and the cervicovaginal smear, respectively. The outcome of liver transplantation for children has been markedly improved during the last several decades. However, the present case highlights the need to perform periodic genital examinations for the adolescents after liver transplantation. In addition to the high risk and probable high subtypes, uncommonly found human papillomavirus subtypes were extracted from her vulvar cancer. The present case is the first to show the possible relationship between previously unknown and uncommon human papillomavirus subtypes and pediatric post-transplant vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. More attention should be paid to the vulvar and cervical surveillance of pediatric transplant recipients by both medical specialists and general physicians.
