Immunization with a poly (lactide co-glycolide) encapsulated plasmid DNA expressing antigenic regions of HPV 16 and 18 results in an increase in the precursor frequency of T cells that respond to epitopes from HPV 16, 18, 6 and 11. A phase II trial was conducted in subjects with human papillomavirus (HPV) associated high-grade cervical dysplasia testing the safety and efficacy of a microparticle encapsulated pDNA vaccine. Amolimogene expresses T cell epitopes from E6 and E7 proteins of HPV types 16 and 18. An analysis was performed on a subset of HLA-A2+ subjects to test whether CD8+ T cells specific to HPV 16, 18, 6 and 11 were increased in response to amolimogene immunization. Of the 21 subjects receiving amolimogene, 11 had elevated CD8+ T cell responses to HPV 16 and/or 18 peptides and seven of these also had increases to corresponding HPV 6 and/or 11 peptides. In addition, T cells primed and expanded in vitro with an HPV 18 peptide demonstrated cross-reactivity to the corresponding HPV 11 peptide. These data demonstrate that treatment with amolimogene elicits T cell responses to HPV 16, 18, 6 and 11.
