Cribriform adenocarcinoma of minor salivary gland origin principally affecting the tongue: characterization of new entity. We present a series of 23 cases of a distinctive, hitherto poorly recognized low-grade adenocarcinoma, with several histologic features reminiscent of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, and which mostly but not exclusively occurs in the tongue. All the tumors were unencapsulated and were divided into lobules that were composed mainly of cribriform and solid growth patterns. Therefore, we propose the name "cribriform adenocarcinoma of minor salivary gland origin (CAMSG)." All the patients were adults with a mean age at diagnosis of 55.8 years (range, 25 to 85 y). Fourteen of the 23 tumors were localized in the tongue, 3 in the soft palate, 2 in the retromolar buccal mucosa, 3 in the lingual tonsils, and 1 in the upper lip. Fifteen patients of 23 had synchronous metastases in the cervical lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis, bilateral in 3 cases. In 3 patients, the nodal metastasis was the first evidence of disease, later investigation revealing primary neoplasms in the base of tongue and tonsil, respectively. In addition, 1 patient developed a cervical lymph node metastasis 8 years after excision of a primary tumor of the tongue. Data on treatment and follow-up were available in 14 cases. The patients were treated by radical excision with clear margins (12 cases) or by simple excision (2 cases). Neck dissection was performed in 10 patients 9 received radiotherapy, but none were treated by chemotherapy. Clinical follow-up ranged from 2 months to 13 years (mean, 6 y and 5 mo). Twelve patients are alive with no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease after treatment, 1 patient died 2 years after surgery without evidence of tumor, and 1 patient is alive with recurrent tumor of the palate.
