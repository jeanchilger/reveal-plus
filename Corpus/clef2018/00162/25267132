Mothers' knowledge, health beliefs and intentions to vaccinate their daughters against human papillomavirus in Korea. Abstract This study aimed to identify the factors influencing Korean mothers' intentions to vaccinate their daughters against human papillomavirus (HPV). In Korea, a mother's will is a key determinant for daughters receiving the cervical cancer vaccine. The factors influencing mothers' intentions to vaccinate their daughters against HPV were the perceived benefits of the vaccine, having acquaintances with cervical cancer experiences, awareness of the cervical cancer vaccine, believing that one's daughter needs regular Pap smears, and occupation these variables explained 32% of the variance. The perceived benefits of the vaccine were the strongest predictor of mothers' intentions. The findings of the current study suggested that mothers' perceived benefits about the HPV vaccine play an important role in their choice to vaccinate their daughters.
