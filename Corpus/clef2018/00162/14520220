Factors that affect the quality of cytologic cervical cancer screening along the Mexico-United States border. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that affect the quality of cytologic cervical cancer screening conducted in public sector clinics in Sonora, Mexico.We assessed the quality of cervical cytology before and after a 2-hour training session and the implementation of cervical spatulas and endocervical brushes. Additionally, we conducted a cross-sectional study of reproductive aged women who attended public clinics in paired border communities in Sonora and Arizona. Cervical cytologic specimens (n=2436) were collected and compared for adequacy and cytologic diagnosis and for the prevalence of human papillomavirus infection.The training intervention achieved significantly improved the rates of satisfactory but limited smears and unsatisfactory smears. The cross-sectional study revealed comparable quality indicators for cytologic specimens that were collected in Sonora and Arizona clinics.A high-quality cytology-based cervical cancer screening program is possible in public sector clinics in Sonora, with indicators similar to those achieved in comparable Arizona clinics.
