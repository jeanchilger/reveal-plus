Identification of seroreactive epitopes of human papillomavirus type 18 E7 protein by synthetic peptides. Nine everlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of early protein E7 of human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18) were synthesized and tested as antigens with pools of selected human sera in ELISA. Peptides denoted 18/E7-2, 18/E7-3, and 18/E7-5 (amino acid positions 11-33, 21-40, and 41-60, respectively) were reactive with pooled sera originating from HPV-18 DNA-positive cervical cancer patients but not with sera from HPV-16 DNA-positive cervical cancer patients or from condyloma acuminata patients. This suggested that the epitopes contained in these peptides were HPV-18 type-specific, relative to HPV types 16, 11, and 6. On the other hand, 18/E7-1 (aa 1-23) and 18/E7-6 (aa 51-70) peptides were cross-reactive. The prevalence of antibodies reactive with 18/E7-2, 18/E7-3, and 18/E7-5 peptides in cervical carcinoma patients was very low. Thus, the utilization of these peptides for monitoring HPV-18 infection seems to be rather limited.
