A comparison study of human papillomavirus prevalence by the polymerase chain reaction in low risk women and in a gynaecology referral group at elevated risk for cervical cancer. The reported prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 in the genital tracts of women with various gynaecological conditions is highly variable. In particular, some results with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique have suggested that HPV-16 is a ubiquitous or very common virus. We undertook this study to help clarify the current confusion. PCR with HPV consensus L1 primers and specific E6 primers was used to study 89 women attending two gynaecology referral clinics, as well as 99 women attending a health maintenance organization (HMO) clinic 70 of these latter women had no current or prior history of genital HPV disease. HPV-16 was detected in less than 5% of cytologically normal women from either group and in 17% (6/36) and 31% (9/29) of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) from the referral clinic and the HMO, respectively. The other high-risk or intermediate-risk HPVs (types 18, 31, 33 or 35) were less prevalent than HPV 16 in all groups of women. A majority of the HPV types detected by the L1 primers in normal women were uncharacterized HPVs. Overall these uncharacterized HPVs were detected in 37% (46/123) of the normal women and in 48% (31/65) of the women with CIN. Using the most sensitive PCR product detection method employed in the study, HPV DNA was detected in 36% (4/11) of swab specimens obtained from the external abdomen.
