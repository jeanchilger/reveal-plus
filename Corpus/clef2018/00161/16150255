Colposcopic and histopathologic evaluation of women participating in population-based screening for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid persistence. Evaluation of colposcopic and histopathological findings in women screened for cervical human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid persistence.A total of 12 527 women, aged 32 to 38 years old, attending the population-based cervical cancer screening program in Sweden were randomized 1:1 to mock testing or human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing by general primer 5+/6+ polymerase chain reaction and subsequent typing. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid-positive women with a normal Papanicolaou smear (n=341) and an equal number from the control group were human papillomavirus tested on average 19 months later. One hundred nineteen women with type-specific human papillomavirus persistence and 111 controls were referred to colposcopy, and 84.8% attended.Histopathology from colposcopically directed biopsies confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 in 28 of 100 of the women with human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid persistence and in 2 of 95 among controls.Among women with normal Papanicolaou smear attending population-based screening, the positive predictive value of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid persistence for detection of biopsy-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or 3 was 29%.
