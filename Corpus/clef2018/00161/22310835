Possible implication of Mdm2 as a prognostic marker in invasive laryngeal carcinoma. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common malignant neoplasms of the head and neck. In Brazil, laryngeal tumors represent 2% of all cancers and are associated with approximately 3,000 deaths annually. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been reported to play an important role in the etiology of laryngeal cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of p53, p27, and Mdm2 in laryngeal carcinomas. Sixty-three larynx biopsies were selected for the study, including 9 in situ laryngeal carcinomas, 27 laryngeal carcinomas without metastasis and 27 laryngeal carcinomas with metastasis. Twenty-seven cervical lymph nodes from patients with metastatic lesions were also evaluated. The expression levels of p53, p27, and Mdm2 were assessed by immunohistochemistry using a computer-assisted system. HPV detection and typing were performed using PCR, and the HPV types that were evaluated included HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31 and 33. Out of 63 patients, 53 (84.1%) were positive for β-globin (internal control), and 10 (15.9%) were β-globin negative and therefore excluded from the evaluation. Thus, 7 (13.2%) out of 53 patients were HPV positive, and 46 (86.8%) out of 53 patients were HPV negative. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in Mdm2 expression levels were observed in the in situ laryngeal carcinoma samples compared with the laryngeal carcinoma samples with metastasis. No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in either p53 or p27 expression levels were detected. These findings suggest that Mdm2 may be associated with the invasiveness and aggressiveness of laryngeal carcinomas.
