Endovascular treatment of ruptured axillary and large internal mammary artery aneurysms in a patient with Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome is an autosomally inherited disorder affecting the synthesis of connective tissues. Vascular manifestations of Marfan syndrome include aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root, aortic dissection, and rupture. Peripheral aneurysms are mostly reported in the iliac, femoral, and subclavian arteries. We report a Marfan patient with a ruptured axillary artery aneurysm and a large left internal mammary artery aneurysm. The axillary aneurysm was successfully excluded using covered stent grafts, and the left internal mammary artery aneurysm was effectively coiled. Duplex ultrasound imaging at 4 months and computed tomography at 9 months demonstrated complete thrombosis and exclusion of both aneurysms with patent subclavian-axillary stent grafts.
