Radiographic findings in aneurysms of the aorta. The use of specific radiographic criteria in the investigation of an aneurysm of the aorta will enable the physician to determine its etiology with a high degree of accuracy. The etiology, location, type, and extent of an aneurysm determine the proper mode of therapy. Aortography, therefore, is the single most important examination for the diagnosis, and will predict the ultimate prognosis in a patient with an aortic aneurysm. This review critically evaluates major recent articles on aortic aneurysms, emphasizing radiographic findings which have a high degree of reliability and cautioning the reader about nonspecific signs which have been reported. Each type of aortic aneurysm is described in detail, stressing criteria which allow the radiologist to be as specific as possible in determining the etiology and extent of the aneurysm.
