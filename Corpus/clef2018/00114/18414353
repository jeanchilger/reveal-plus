Successful replacement of aortic valve using a stentless porcine valve in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome. Open heart surgery in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) increases the risk of bleeding and infection. We document a 78-year-old female with severe aortic valve stenosis and MDS who underwent aortic valve replacement with stentless porcine prosthesis. Perioperatively, a transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) and an infusion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were needed for serious erythrocytopenia and leukocytopenia. We did not need a large amount of RBC transfusions in the postoperative course, and no infection was seen postoperatively.
