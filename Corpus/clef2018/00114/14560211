Existence of abdominal aortic aneurysms in patients with thoracic aortic dissections. The objective of this study was to determine the coexistence or later development of pararenal and infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in patients with thoracic aortic dissections.One hundred forty-five patients (95 men, 50 women) encountered from 1992 to 2001 with thoracic aortic dissections-excluding those associated with trauma, those with Marfan's syndrome, and those with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms-were studied. The most common risk factors included hypertension (59%) and a history of tobacco use (52%). Type III dissections affected 86 patients (59%), and type I dissections affected the remaining 59 patients (41%). Aortic computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained annually. Data were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses.Five patients (3%) had a history of AAA repair prior to their thoracic aortic dissection diagnosis-3 were type III dissections and 2 were type I dissections. Twelve patient's (8%) AAAs were diagnosed with the initial CT study of their thoracic aortic dissection. Type III dissections accounted for all but one of these (11 of 12, 92%). Ten additional AAAs (7%) developed in the 128 patients with no initial evidence of an AAA being recognized from 1 to 48 months (average 16 months) after the thoracic aortic dissection was diagnosed. Type III dissections affected 8 of these 10 patients. Among the total 27 AAAs noted in this series, 74% (20 AAAs) were not continuous with the thoracic aortic dissection. In the univariate analysis, age (P =.0002), male gender (P =.044), history of smoking (P =.01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P <.001), duration of dissection (P =.05), and presence of type III dissection (P =.009) were associated with the presence of an AAA. In the multivariate analysis, both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio 5.4, 95% CI, 1.3 to 22.3 P =.02) and age (OR 1.06, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.11This study documented that patients with thoracic aortic dissections are at risk to harbor or develop a later AAA. This finding supports the tenet that abdominal CTs or ultrasound scanning should be mandatory in the follow-up of patients with known thoracic aortic dissections.
