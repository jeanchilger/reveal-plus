Aorta and aortic valve morphologies predisposing to aortic dissection. An in vivo assessment with transoesophageal echocardiography. Predisposing factors for aortic dissection are well known from necropsy series. To evaluate the frequency of aortic and aortic valve disease in aortic dissection in vivo, 139 patients with acute aortic dissection (96 men, 43 women, mean age 60.5 +/- 15.7 years) were studied by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using 3.5 and 5.0 MHz transducers. Left ventricular hypertrophy by TEE, defined as an end-diastolic wall thickness of the left ventricular septal wall over 1.5 cm, was found in 42 (67.7%) of 62 patients with type I, in 10 (58.8%) of 17 patients with type II and in 46 (76.7%) of 60 patients with type III dissection. The mean value for the aortic root diameter was 3.2 +/- 1.3 cm.m-2 in type I dissection and 2.8 +/- 0.9 cm.m-2(ns) in type II dissection. In the patient group with type III dissection this diameter was significantly smaller (1.8 +/- 0.9 cm.m-2 P < 0.001). Thickening of aortic valve leaflets was demonstrated in six (9.7%) of 62 patients with aortic dissection type I (two of them with mild aortic stenosis), in two (11.8%) of 17 patients with aortic dissection type II and in 15 (25.0%) of 60 patients with aortic dissection type III. A bicuspid aortic valve was diagnosed in five (6.3%) of 79 patients with aortic dissection types I and II and in one (1.7%) of 60 patients with type III dissection. By colour coded Doppler echocardiography, aortic regurgitation was found in 46 (74.2%) of 62 patients with type I, 13 (76.5%) of 17 patients with type II and 23 (38.3%) of 60 patients with type III dissection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
