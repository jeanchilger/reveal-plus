Magnetic resonance tomography and magnetic resonance angiography in diagnosis of complicated popliteal artery aneurysm. Regarding the frequency of aneurysms, the popliteal artery comes third behind the abdominal aorta and the iliac arteries. In up to 50% of cases a sudden limb-threatening thrombotic occlusion may occur. Early surgical intervention is the therapy of choice. We report the case of a 56-year-old patient whose popliteal aneurysms (PAs) in both legs had been bypassed with a venous graft some years previously. He presented with acute pain and tumescence in the left popliteal fossa combined with inflammatory symptoms. Neither ultrasonography nor DSA could distinguish between an extravascular inflammatory process, an anastomotic aneurysm and a partial reperfusion of the original PA due to a leaking anastomosis. The correct diagnosis was provided by MRI in combination with MRA, confirmed by the intraoperative findings. The value of MRA in the diagnostic imaging of the vasculature of the lower extremities is discussed and compared alternative methods.
