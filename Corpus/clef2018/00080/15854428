Application of positron emission tomography in diagnosis and staging for lung cancer. To determine the usefulness of positron emission tomography with fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG-PET) in lung cancer.From September 1999 to April 2003, patients with lung cancer or indeterminate lung lesions on chest CT scan were enrolled, and underwent FDG-PET scanning.Of 104 patients, 64 (60%) had malignancy and 40 (40%) had a benign process. The standard uptake ratio (SUV) in patients with lung cancer was significantly higher than that in patients with benign disease, 4.5 (1.2 - 11.7) and 1.0 (0 - 7.7) respectively. The SUV was not related with histologic type, differentiation, staging and the size of lesion. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET imaging for lung cancer were 88%, 85% and 87% respectively, and the diagnostic specificity and accuracy for lung cancer with PET were significant higher than those with CT scan. The specificity and accuracy of lung lesions with a diameter >or= 1.5 cm with SUV method was better than that of lesions with a diameter < 1.5 cm. In 6 false positive patients, 4 were tuberculosis, 1 fungal infection and 1 organic pneumonia. Both PET and CT scan were poorly sensitive and specific for detecting local lymph node metastasis.PET had advantages in evaluation of lung lesions, and integrated PET and CT were recommended for detecting local lymph node metastasis.
