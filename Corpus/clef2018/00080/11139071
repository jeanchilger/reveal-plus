F-18 FDG uptake in endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer, which is one of the most common malignant gynecologic diseases, was detected by F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in a 60-year-old woman with abdominal distention. FDG PET revealed heterogeneous and marked accumulation in the endometrium, which was thought to represent endometrial cancer. In addition, focal intense accumulation of FDG in both lungs suggestive of lung metastases were noted. Endometrial cancer and lung metastases were confirmed by endometrial biopsy and computed tomography of the chest, respectively.
