Usefulness of whole-body (18)F-FDG PET in patients with suspected metastatic brain tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of whole-body (18)F-FDG PET imaging in the differentiation of metastatic brain tumor from primary brain tumor and in the localization of the primary lesion in patients with metastatic brain tumor.The subjects consisted of 127 patients (77 men, 50 women mean age +/- SD, 55 +/- 12 y) with brain masses that were suspected to be metastatic brain tumors on radiologic studies: 77 with confirmed metastatic brain tumor and 50 with primary brain tumor. Whole-body (18)F-FDG PET was performed on all patients. When the abnormal lesion was detected outside the brain, we interpreted the brain lesion as metastatic brain tumor.In 61 of the 77 patients with metastatic brain tumor, primary lesions were detected using whole-body (18)F-FDG PET. Of the remaining 16 patients (all false-negative cases), 7 were classified as metastases of unknown origin. In 47 of the 50 patients with primary brain tumor, whole-body (18)F-FDG PET did not show any other abnormal lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of PET for the detection of primary origin were 79.2%, 94.0%, 95.3%, 74.6%, and 85.0%, respectively. The most common primary origin of metastatic brain tumors on PET examination was lung cancer (48/61, 78.7%). The concordance rate between (18)F-FDG PET and conventional radiologic work-up was 80% in identifying primary lesion. Unknown bone or bone marrow metastases and unsuspected distant metastases were found in 14 patients (18%) and 24 patients (31%), respectively, on PET examination.Screening the patients with suspected metastatic brain tumors using whole-body (18)F-FDG PET could be helpful in differentiating metastatic brain tumor from primary brain tumor and in detecting the primary lesion.
