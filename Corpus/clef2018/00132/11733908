Obstructive jaundice secondary to lymphoma in childhood. In children, biliary obstruction secondary to lymphoma is rare. Previous reports in adults and children suggest that these lymphomas are associated with a poor prognosis. The authors reviewed the medical records and imaging studies of 4 children treated for pancreaticobiliary lymphoma at our children's hospital over the past 10 years. All 4 presented with jaundice. Abdominal ultrasound scan and computed tomography (CT) scans were helpful in defining the anatomy of the obstruction. In the cases of involvement of the porta hepatis, the diagnosis was made by biopsy. In one child a mass was in the head of the pancreas, and evaluation of frozen section biopsy results were not diagnostic for lymphoma, and a major resection was performed. All the lymphomas were of nonHodgkin's B-cell type and one was a Burkitt's lymphoma. All responded promptly to chemotherapy. One child had a testicular relapse and currently is receiving additional therapy. Pancreaticobiliary lymphomas are an unusual cause of obstructive jaundice in children. Biopsy alone without resection or biliary drainage is recommended surgical therapy. Long-term survival rate in children with this disorder appears to be more promising than previously reported.
