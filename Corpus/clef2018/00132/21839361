Intravascular lymphoma: report of two autopsic cases, literature review. Intravacular large B-cell lymphoma (LIV) is a rare entity individualized in the WHO classification since 2001 as a subtype of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We report two autopsic cases of LIV: a 77-year-old woman presenting with fever, dyspnea, antehypophyseal failure and a 54-year-old man presenting with fever, weight-loss, night-sweats and encephalopathy. They died respectively 10 and 7 months after the beginning of symptoms, without diagnosis. Neither infectious disease nor lymphomatous proliferation had been identified. From these two cases and our literature review, we insist on the importance of histopathological diagnosis on biopsy for this rare pathology which clinical diagnosis remains difficult.
