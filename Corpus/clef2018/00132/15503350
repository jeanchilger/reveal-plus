Pancreatic sarcoidosis: MRI features. Pancreatic sarcoidosis is a rare entity, and few reports in the literature describe the CT aspects of the disease. We report the MR features of a pathologically-confirmed case of pancreatic sarcoidosis, which presented as multiple pancreatic masses with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, mild high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and decreased enhancement compared to the normal pancreas after administration of gadolinium. Pancreatic sarcoidosis should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis of multiple pancreatic masses with these MRI features.
