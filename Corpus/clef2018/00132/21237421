Celiac artery trunk thrombosis: an unusual complication of pancreatitis diagnosed on MRI. Celiac artery trunk thrombosis is a rare complication of pancreatitis. Only two other cases have been reported in the English-language literature. Here, we present the clinical and multimodality imaging findings for a woman with pancreatitis who had continued pain after normalization of pancreatic enzyme levels and was unexpectedly found to have occlusion of her celiac trunk on follow-up MRI. She was managed as an outpatient and had spontaneous resolution 2 weeks later.
