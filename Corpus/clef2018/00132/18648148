Recurrent acute pancreatitis and Wirsungocele. A case report and review of literature. The association of Santorinicele with pancreas divisum has been well described. There is an increased risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis in patients with pancreas divisum who also have Santorinicele. Focal saccular dilation of the terminal part of the main pancreatic duct has been described as an incidental finding and termed, 'Wirsungocele'.We report a case of a 39-year-old male who had recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. Laboratory tests, US of the abdomen and CECT of the abdomen confirmed acute pancreatitis. MRCP showed focal saccular dilation of the terminal part of the main pancreatic duct suggestive of Wirsungocele. An ERCP confirmed MRCP findings. An endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy was performed and a 5 Fr single pigtail pancreatic stent was placed. The pancreatic stent was removed after 4 weeks. At the 12-week follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic.This case report describes the association of Wirsungocele with recurrent acute pancreatitis.
