Radiological features of the visceral and skeletal involvement of hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a multisystem disorder produced by the excessive accumulation of iron in visceral organs and the musculoskeletal system. Clinically the disease may be silent, but characteristic radiological features may point to the diagnosis. The increased iron stores in the organs involved, especially in the liver and pancreas, result in an increased attenuation at unenhanced CT and an decreased signal intensity at MR imaging. Hemochromatosis arthropathy includes degenerative osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis. The distribution of the arthropathy is distinctive, but not unique, frequently affecting the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand.
