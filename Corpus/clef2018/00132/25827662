Laparoscopic ultrasound: a surgical "must" for second line intra-operative evaluation of pancreatic cancer resectability. Advanced laparoscopy for pancreatic cancer surgery should include laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS), in order to accurately evaluate resectability and rule out the presence of undetected metastases and/or vascular infiltration. LUS should be done as a preliminary step whenever pre-operative imaging casts doubts on resectability.We hereby report our experience of 18 consecutive patients, aged 43-76, coming to our attention during a six months period (Jan-Jun 2013), with a diagnosis of pancreas head or body cancer.LUS allowed to rule out undetected metastases or mesenteric vessels infiltration in 11 patients (61.1%), who were submitted, as previously scheduled, to radical duodeno-pancreatectomy (9 cases) and spleno-caudal pancreatectomy (2 cases). Among the remaining patients, three had been correctly evaluated as non resectable radically at pre-operative work out, and confirmed at LUS, while LUS detected non resectable disease in further 4 patients (22.2%), who underwent palliative procedures. In 2 patients of this group liver micro-metastases were found, while 2 were excluded because of mesenteric vessels infiltration.LUS provided a higher level of diagnostic accuracy, allowing in our experience to exclude 4 patients from radical surgery (22.2%). The evaluation of surgical resectability is an issue of crucial importance to decide surgical strategy in pancreas tumor surgery. In our opinion LUS should be considered a mandatory step in laparoscopic approach to pancreatic tumors, to better define disease staging and evaluate resectability.
