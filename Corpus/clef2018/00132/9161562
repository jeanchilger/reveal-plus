Muscular metastases disclosing adenocarcinoma. The authors report the case of a 67-year old man, with no particular medical history, presenting a large swelling of the left thigh. Investigations conclude to metastases located in muscles of the left thigh and of the pelvis, secondary to an adenocarcinoma of presumed pancreatic origin. With reference to this case, features of muscular metastases are reviewed. Muscular metastases seldom occur during the course of a cancer and are exceptionally the first manifestation of a neoplastic process. They are usually described as a painful mass, but symptoms can be misleading and delay diagnosis. Images obtained by ultrasonography, tomodensitometry and magnetic resonance imaging are not specific and histological examination is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
