Intraductal papillary mucinous tumors of the pancreas: features with multimodality imaging. The radiologic diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas is important to establish because of its malignant potential and in order to determine the site of tumor origin and its extent. These pancreatic tumors are recognized more often now than previously because of the increasing use of imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. The main features of IPMT are given in this pictorial essay, with illustrations provided from a series of 50 patients with a surgically proven diagnosis of IPMT.
