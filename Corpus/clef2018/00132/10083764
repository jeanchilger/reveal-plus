Diagnostic efficacy of non-breath-hold magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an emerging imaging technique for direct visualization of biliary and pancreatic ducts without the need for an invasive procedure, ionizing radiation, or iodine contrast media administration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of non-breath-hold MRCP in depicting normal and diseased biliary and pancreatic ducts. A retrospective analysis of 162 patients who underwent MRCP was performed, and a comparison between MRCP and direct cholangiography was made. The overall accuracy of MRCP in diagnosing malignant and benign pancreaticobiliary diseases was also calculated. MRCP depicted more than three hepatic segments in 99% of patients with dilated intrahepatic ducts and in 63% of patients with nondilated intrahepatic ducts. MRCP demonstrated the main hepatic duct, gallbladder, and cystic duct in 100%, 89%, and 72% of patients, respectively. The dilated extrahepatic duct, nondilated extrahepatic duct, dilated pancreatic duct, and nondilated pancreatic duct were visualized in 100%, 98%, 95%, and 77% of patients, respectively. The accuracy of MRCP in diagnosing hepatolithiasis, cholecystolithiasis, and choledocholithiasis was 96%, 97%, and 96%, respectively. The obstruction levels and characteristics determined by MRCP were in agreement with those determined from direct cholangiography in 98% of malignant obstructions and 89% of benign obstructions. The overall accuracy of a combination of MRCP and conventional magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing pancreaticobiliary diseases was 81% for malignant diseases, 86% for benign diseases, and 82% for stone diseases. We conclude that non-breath-hold MRCP can reliably depict normal and diseased pancreaticobiliary ducts except for cystic ducts and nondilated pancreatic ducts.
