Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the pituitary gland presenting with hypopituitarism. A 57-year-old man with pituitary metastasis from renal cell carcinoma is reported. He underwent right nephrectomy and total pancreatectomy for renal cell carcinoma and its pancreatic metastasis, respectively. Imaging studies showed an intrasellar mass lesion. The examination revealed panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus and bitemporal hemianospia. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma was diagnosed by the biopsy of the pituitary tumor. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the pituitary gland, which is extremely rare, appears to have unique features of presenting with hypopituitarism and visual disturbance more frequently than other metastatic pituitary tumors.
