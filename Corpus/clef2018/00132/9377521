MR cholangiopancreatography at 0.5 T with a 3D inversion recovery turbo-spin-echo sequence. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) at 0.5 T. The MRCP technique was performed in 28 patients with symptomatology referrable to the biliary system. A three-dimensional (3D) inversion recovery turbo-spin-echo (TSE) sequence was used to create 3D reconstructions of the bile ducts. Dilation of the biliary tree or pancreatic duct in 23 patients due to tumor, calculi, or strictures was depicted with excellent contrast resolution. The approximate level of obstruction and all calculi were accurately predicted by MRCP. In another 3 patients no cause was found for the biliary dilatation. In the last 2 cases no abnormalities were found by either MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The MRCP technique at 0.5 T is an accurate method for the assessment of pathology of the biliary tree.
