Brucellar spondylitis. We carried out a prospective analysis of 86 patients with brucellosis, and 26 (30%) cases were diagnosed as brucellar spondylitis. Two patients had cervical involvement, two thoracic, and 21 lumbosacral as seen in MRI. Four patients had epidural abscess and two had paravertebral abscess. All patients received combined antibiotic therapy for 4 to 12 months. Those with cervical involvement underwent surgical treatment because of medullar compression. Neither death nor severe sequelae were observed.
