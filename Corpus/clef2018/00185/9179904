Retropharyngeal pseudomeningocele after atlanto-occipital dislocation: report of two cases. We report two cases of retropharyngeal pseudomeningocele after atlanto-occipital dislocation. This is rare, with only one other reported case in the literature.We report two patients who presented after blunt cervical and head trauma. Plain films revealed that each patient had atlanto-occipital dislocation. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed the delayed development of retropharyngeal pseudomeningocele. Concomitant hydrocephalus was noted in both patients.The surviving patient showed marked neurological improvement and resolution of his pseudomeningocele after ventriculoperitoneal shunting.For patients with closed head injuries who develop posttraumatic pseudomeningocele, we recommend cranial computed tomography to assess for the presence of hydrocephalus. In patients with atlanto-occipital dislocation, delayed neurological deterioration warrants magnetic resonance imaging of the craniocervical junction to rule out posttraumatic pseudomeningocele.
