Inhibition of glucose transport in human red blood cells by adenosine antagonists. Previous studies have suggested that adenosine antagonists can interfere with normal glucose uptake in perfused rat heart. In the present studies, fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to study the effect of the adenosine antagonist, BW-A1433U, on the equilibrium exchange of fluorinated glucose analogs in human erythrocytes. Studies of the equilibrium exchange of both 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-glucose with either one-dimensional magnetization transfer or two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy were performed, and significant inhibition was observed in all cases. From concentration-dependent studies, an inhibition constant for the equilibrium exchange measured at 37 degrees C of 24 microM was determined.
