Cerebral blood flow study in patients with moyamoya disease evaluated by IMP SPECT. We studied the usefulness of IMP SPECT with acetazolamide in 16 patients with moyamoya disease. Cerebral angiography was performed for all patients who were classified in three grades according to their angiographic stages.Techniques used included ring-type emission computed tomography with a minicomputer system. Patients received 111 MBq of 123I-IMP and SPECT images were obtained 20 min postinjection. Nine patients were studied using iodoamphetamine (IMP) SPECT with and without acetazolamide. IMP SPECT with acetazolamide was performed 20 min after each injection of 1 g of acetazolamide.Low perfusion areas in the upper and lower frontal, parietal and temporal regions in grades 2 and 3 using IMP SPECT were observed. The mean cerebral-to-cerebellar activity ratios (C/C ratio) of six regions (upper and lower frontal, temporal, parietal occipital and basal ganglia) in grades 1, 2 and 3 were 0.96 to 1.06, 0.91 to 0.96 and 0.76 to 0.88, respectively.Our results indicate that measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) elucidates cerebral hemodynamic factors, including the reactivity of cerebral vessels which cannot be detected angiographically in patients with moyamoya disease, and that the acetazolamide test is useful for detecting cerebral blood flow reserve. The test can be used to detect disease progress prospectively.
