Evaluation of 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime cerebral blood flow mapping after acute focal ischemia in rats. Although the blood flow tracer hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime is now widely used for cerebral blood flow mapping using single-photon emission computed tomography, its uptake into acutely ischemic brain has not been well studied. We performed a double-label autoradiographic study in which 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime uptake was compared with [14C]iodoantipyrine-derived cerebral blood flow 0.5, 24, and 72 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion in 11 rats. We noted excellent correspondence between iodoantipyrine and hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime autoradiograms at all times with both simultaneous tracer injection and 30-minute separation of tracer injections. When the ischemic and hyperemic areas were measured from the same brain section using the two different tracers, hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime underestimated the iodoantipyrine-derived areas by less than 1% (95% confidence interval -2.9% to 2.3%). The maximum discrepancy (-19%) was seen at high flows. When the two tracers were injected separately, the uptake of hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime was not linear compared with iodoantipyrine-derived cerebral blood flow, but the relation became linear after the Lassen correction factor was applied. Hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime uptake thus accurately represents cerebral blood flow 0.5-72 hours after acute cerebral ischemia.
