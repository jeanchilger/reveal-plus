Identification of hemodynamic compromise by cerebrovascular reserve and oxygen extraction fraction in occlusive vascular disease. Cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) are used to identify hemodynamic compromise in symptomatic patients with carotid occlusive vascular disease, but evidence suggests that they are not equivalent. The authors studied the relationship between CVR and OEF to evaluate their equivalence and stages of hemodynamic compromise. Symptomatic patients (N = 12) with carotid occlusion were studied by stable xenon-computed tomography CBF after intravenous acetazolamide administration for CVR, followed within 24 hours by positron emission tomography (PET) for OEF. Middle cerebral artery territories were analyzed by hemisphere and level. Hemispheric subcortical white matter infarctions were graded with magnetic resonance imaging. Both hemispheric and level analysis of CVR and OEF showed a significant (P = 0.001), negative linear relationship [CVR (%) = -1.5 (OEF) + 83.4, (r = -0.57, P = 0.001, n = 24]. However, 37.5% of the hemispheres showed compromised CVR but normal OEF and were associated (P = 0.019) with subcortical white matter infarction. CMRO2 was elevated in stage II hemodynamic compromise (CVR < 10%, OEF > 50%). CVR and OEF showed a significant negative linear relationship in stage II hemodynamic compromise but revealed hemispheres in hemodynamic compromise by CVR but normal OEF that were associated with subcortical white matter infarction.
