Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in characterizing solitary pulmonary nodules, assessing pleural diseases, and the initial staging, restaging, therapy planning, and monitoring response of lung cancer. Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET imaging has secured an important role in the assessment and management of a multitude of pulmonary disorders, including solitary pulmonary nodules, lung cancer, and pleural diseases. While conventional imaging modalities such as chest radiography and CT are considered essential in these settings, FDG-PET can provide new information and complement structural imaging techniques in the evaluation of such disorders. In this review, the authors present a growing body of evidence that demonstrates and supports the utility of FDG-PET in the differentiation of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules, the assessment of lung cancer in various stages of disease, and the characterization of pleural diseases. In addition, new developments--such as prospects for potential utility of novel radiotracers and delayed imaging--that can further refine the role of FDG scans in the work-up of lung nodules and cancer and forecast the future place of PET in these common modalities are discussed.
