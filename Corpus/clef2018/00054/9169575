Discrepancy between blood flow and muscarinic receptor distribution in rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion. To clarify whether muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) binding can be a viable muscarinic neuronal marker which provides therapeutic information different from perfusional information in global brain, we evaluated the discrepancy between the distribution of cerebral blood flow (CBF), mAChR and its five subtypes of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in the acute (n=9) and chronic (n=8) phases of a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model and in sham-operated controls (n=6). In the acute phase, regional CBF was markedly reduced in the MCA territory, whereas mAChR was not reduced and the mRNA was reduced only slightly. In the chronic phase, mAChR was reduced markedly in the infarcted lesion and the mRNA was also reduced. The mAChR was slightly reduced in the ipsilateral substantia nigra and pontine nucleus because of remote effects however, regional CBF in the substantia nigra was slightly increased and did not change in the pontine nucleus. The discrepancy between CBF and mAChR was clarified, and the tendency toward a reduction in mRNA in the acute ischaemic region without a reduction in mAChR suggested the presence of cholinergic neurons which were viable but hypometabolic. It is concluded that mAChR imaging may be of value for the assessment of the viable cholinergic neuron density in vivo.
