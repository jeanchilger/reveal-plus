A systematic review of restaging after induction therapy for stage IIIa lung cancer: prediction of pathologic stage. Many clinicians use restaging after induction therapy as a way to select patients for surgery.A systematic review was conducted to define the reliability of restaging tests after induction therapy for stage III(N2) lung cancer, when compared with pathologic findings at surgery.A complete response at all sites carries a false-negative (FN) rate of 50% for computed tomography and 30% for positron emission tomography. Mediastinal node involvement has FN and false-positive rates of 33% and 33% by computed tomography, and 25% and 33% by positron emission tomography. The FN rate of invasive restaging is 22% by repeat mediastinoscopy, 14% by esophageal ultrasound and needle aspiration in expert hands (reliable results are not yet available for endobronchial ultrasound), and 9% by primary mediastinoscopy done with optimal thoroughness. These results are not significantly affected by the type of induction therapy or the timing of restaging.The ability to identify patients who have achieved mediastinal downstaging other than by a careful primary mediastinoscopy is poor.
