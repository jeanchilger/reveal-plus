Time evolution of cerebral perfusion and apparent diffusion coefficient measured by magnetic resonance imaging in a porcine stroke model. To demonstrate the feasibility of sequential diffusion-weighted (DW) and perfusion-weighted (PW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a recently developed porcine stroke model and to evaluate the evolution of cerebral perfusion and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) over time. Materials and Methods In five pigs, DW imaging (DWI) and PW imaging (PWI) was carried out for 7 hours after stroke onset, starting 1 hour after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).The DWI lesion volume increased significantly with time, and final DWI lesion volume correlated well with lesion area on histological sections (r = 0.910). T2 changes could be recognized 3 hours after stroke onset. At 1 hour the ADC ratio (ischemic lesion/contralateral side) was reduced to 0.81 in the caudate-putamen and to 0.87 in the cortex, and the cerebral blood flow ratio was reduced to 0.40 in the caudate-putamen and 0.51 in the cortex.The level of flow reduction in the caudate-putamen and the cortex after 1 hour is in good correlation with human thresholds of irreversible and reversible ischemic damage, and accordingly, this model might be a model for mechanisms of infarct evolution and therapeutic intervention.
