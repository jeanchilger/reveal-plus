Protirelin in the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders. Effects of protirelin tartrate, administered for 14 days (2 mg/day, i.m.) to 15 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease have been investigated. The evaluation was performed by means of SPECT, at enrollment and at the end of treatment. This evaluation was aimed at the early detection of ischemic damage and assessment of the size of the hypoperfusion area. Treatment with protirelin tartrate was well tolerated and led to definite improvement of the scintigraphic findings in about 74% of the patients.
