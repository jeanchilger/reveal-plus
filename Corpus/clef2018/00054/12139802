Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in patients with primary lung cancer. To assess the relationship between histological type and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) uptake in patients with primary lung cancer and the factors affecting FDG uptake.From October 1998 to April 2001, 82 patients with lung cancer were imaged with FDG-PET (Positron emission tomography) before surgery or biopsy. Their maximum and mean standard uptake value(SUVmax and SUVmean) of tumor and SUV of normal lung (SUVlung) were measured.All tumors were detected by FDG-PET(r)FDG uptake of tumor was higher than that of normal lung (P < 0.01). FDG uptake was lower in adenocarcinoma(AC) than in squamous cell carcinoma (SQC), and that of bronchial aveolar carcinomas(BAC) was the lowest [SUVmax was 8.42 +/- 4.05,5.91 +/- 3.91 and 2.97 +/- 1.10, respectively SUVmean was 6.12 +/- 2.90,4.35+/- 3.10 and 2.25 +/- 0.99, respectively (P < 0.01)]. Correlations were found between FDG uptake and tumor size (P < 0.01)(r)Glucose level and SUV of normal lung could affect SUV of lung cancer (P < 0.05).SUV is higher in cancer tissue than in normal lung tissue. FDG uptake is different among SQC,AC and BAC. FDG uptake and tumor size appear to be correlated with each other.SQC, AC and BAC have their own features respectively. The effects of glucose and SUV lung should be considered in the diagnosis of lung cancer with PET.
