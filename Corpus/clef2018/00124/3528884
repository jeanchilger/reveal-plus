Renovascular hypertension. Ability to renal vein ratio to predict the blood pressure level 18-24 months after surgery. Fourteen patients with severe hypertension and renal artery stenosis were treated surgically. One patient died 4 days after surgery due to a cerebral thrombosis. The other 13 patients were followed for 18-24 months. Five were considered cured since the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was less than or equal to 90 mm Hg without therapy. Five were improved since DBP was less than or equal to 100 mm Hg during treatment with only one or two antihypertensive agents. There were unchanged. Renal vein renin ratio (RVRR) was greater than or equal to 1.5 either before or after furosemide in all patients who were cured or improved and less than or equal to 1.5 in 2 of 3 who were unchanged. It can be concluded that surgical treatment cured or improved 77% of the patients, and that a RVRR greater than or equal to 1.5 is a good predictor of the blood pressure lowering effect of surgery.
