Intraluminal suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in Spontaneously Hypertensive rats. In models of middle cerebral artery occlusion using intraluminal suture, the size and the distribution of ischemic injury vary considerably among laboratories. In transcranial models of cerebral ischemia, a more consistent cerebral ischemic lesion is seen in Spontaneously Hypertensive rats (SHR). In the present study, we performed intraluminal suture occlusion of the MCA in SHR and compared its reproducibility with those in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Male SHR and SD rats were anesthetized with halothane and subjected to 2 h of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion by an intraluminal suture. Comparisons of regional cerebral blood flow figures taken throughout the experiment and lesion volume figures taken at 24 h after occlusion were made between the two groups. Total lesion volume in the SHR group was 263.6+/-30.5 mm3 (mean +/- SD), significantly larger and less variable than that in the SD group (145.4+/-123.7 mm3, p < 0.02). Throughout the ischemic period there was a tendency for rCBF to be lower in the SHR group than in the SD group. In some animals of both groups, recirculation could not be produced by withdrawal of the suture from the ICA. The mortality rate was 9% in the SD group and 17% in the SHR group. Intraluminal MCA occlusion in SHRs is associated with a more consistent, reliable and reproducible volume of ischemic injury. In the studies of temporary focal cerebral ischemia, this model must be accompanied by the monitoring of regional cerebral blood flow so as to obtain more reliable results.
