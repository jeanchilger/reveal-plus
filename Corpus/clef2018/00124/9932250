Role of carotid sonography as a first examination in the evaluation of patients with transient ischemic attacks and strokes: benefit in relation to age. We studied the influence of age on the utility of carotid sonography in patients with transient ischemic attacks and strokes.The results of Doppler ultrasound examinations of the carotid arteries in 613 consecutive patients with transient ischemic attacks (n = 450) or strokes (n = 163) were analyzed for different age groups. For each patient, the grade of stenosis was scored for the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. The results of the ultrasound examinations were correlated with angiographic findings and findings at endarterectomy. The extent of atherosclerosis for each age group was expressed as the ratio between the number of grade II-IV stenoses (> or = 50%) in the carotid arteries and the number of patients in that group ("atherosclerosis ratio").Under the age of 40 years, high-grade atherosclerotic stenoses were not found. However, 3 relatively young patients had dissections of the internal carotid arteries. The atherosclerosis ratio exceeded 0.5 for age groups 65-69 years through 80+ years. Among the patients with high-grade stenoses, ischemic heart disease prevented endarterectomy in 63% of patients in age group 80+ years, 44% in age group 75-79 years, and 26% in age group 70-74 years.Carotid sonography did not detect any significant atherosclerotic changes in young patients but was useful for diagnosing other etiologies of ischemic cerebral disease, eg, carotid dissection. At the other end of the spectrum, the impact of carotid sonography on patient management appears to be limited in patients over the age of 70 years. Carotid sonography seems to be most useful for patients 40-69 years old.
