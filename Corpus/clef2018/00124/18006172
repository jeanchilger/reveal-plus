High total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio predicting deterioration of ankle brachial index in Asian type 2 diabetic subjects. We conducted a prospective study to determine the risk factors for decrease in ABI in Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes during a 3-year period.Type 2 diabetic subjects with normal ABI were enrolled in this study. The risk factors for PVD and ABI were examined before and after the follow-up period.A total of 107 type 2 diabetic subjects completed the assessment. Based on the change of ABI, the study subjects were divided into two groups. Forty subjects, in Group 1, had a decrease in ABI 67 subjects, in Group 2, had no decrease in ABI after the 3-year follow-up. The baseline total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (4.5+/-1.2 vs. 3.9+/-1.0, P=0.018) and serum creatinine (99.0+/-18.0micromol/L vs. 88.8+/-15.7micromol/L, P=0.004) were significantly higher, and the HDL cholesterol concentration was significantly lower (1.11+/-0.26mmol/L vs. 1.27+/-0.39mmol/L, P=0.011) in Group 1 than in Group 2. Furthermore, total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio was the variable showed an inverse correlation and independent predictor for the change in ABI after the 3-year follow-up.Total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio is a major risk factor for PVD and showed an inverse trend to change in ABI in Asian type 2 diabetic subjects.
