Healing of ulcers on the feet correlated with distal blood pressure measurements in occlusive arterial disease. The frequency of healing in subchronic ulcers in 66 feet in 62 patients with arterial occlusive disease was correlated with the systolic digital blood pressure (SDBP) and the systolic ankle blood pressure (SABP), both measured with a strain gauge, and with the skin perfusion pressure on the heel (SPPH) as measured with a photocell. Thirty-two patients (35 feet with ulcerations) had diabetes mellitus. The treatment was conservative. In 42 feet the ulcers healed after an average period of 5.8 months in 24 feet major amputation became necessary after an average of 4.3 months. The frequency of healing correlated significantly with the three distal blood pressure parameters investigated, the closest correlation being with the SDBP measured at the final examination, i.e. just after healing of the ulcer or just before an inevitable major amputation. Of the 22 cases with SDBP below 20 mmHg only two cases (9%) healed. Of the 11 cases with SDBP of 20 to 29 mmHg seven cases (64%) healed and of the 33 cases with SDBP of 30 mmHg or above all cases (100%) healed. There was no significant difference between the 35 diabetic feet and the 31 non-diabetic feet as regards the healing rates, although infection and peripheral neuropathy were frequent in the diabetic group. The data show that the systolic digital blood pressure is a particularly valuable prognostic parameter.
