Multi-country study on the prevalence and clinical features of peripheral arterial disease in Asian type 2 diabetes patients at high risk of atherosclerosis. PAD-SEARCH was the first international study to investigate the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in Asian type 2 diabetic patients and to demonstrate the relationships between putative risk factors and PAD.In total 6625 type 2 diabetic patients aged 50 and older were enrolled and determined ankle-brachial index (ABI) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.Mean patient age was 63.7+/-8.2 years and mean duration of diabetes was 10.3+/-8.0 years. One thousand one hundred and seventy-two (17.7%) subjects were diagnosed as PAD by ABI (< or =0.9). PAD subjects had a significantly longer duration of diabetes, hypertension, higher HbA1c, and a significantly lower mean BMI than non-PAD subjects. In terms of lipid profiles, triglyceride was the only significant variable. Notably, mean ABI and baPWV in females were significantly poorer than age matched males in subjects with a normal ABI. However, mean ABI and baPWV in males were significantly poorer than in age matched females in subjects with PAD.These findings suggest that PAD is a common complication in Asian type 2 diabetic patients. Therefore, PAD screening and treatment should be emphasized for Asian diabetic patients with high risk factors.
