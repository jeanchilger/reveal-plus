Does pet helminth prophylaxis increase the rate of selection for drug resistance? There is a growing tendency to control helminths in pets by the prophylactic use of broad-spectrum drug combinations (Allwormers), some of which are of low efficacy. If similar treatment regimes were applied to livestock, parasite strains resistant to chemotherapy would be expected to evolve. The rate of selection for resistance depends significantly on epidemiological parameters and strategic recommendations based on experience with farm animals might not be applicable to pets without critical examinations. Also, the routine use of Allwormers reduces the level of interaction between veterinarians and pet owners and the valuable contribution by veterinarians towards educating pet owners about animal and public health issues in addition to parasite treatment.
