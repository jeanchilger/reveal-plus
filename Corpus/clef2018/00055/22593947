 The β-glucuronidase (βG EC 3.2.1.31) is a lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-glucuronic acid residues from the cell-surface glycosaminoglycans for normal reconstruction of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (1), and the enzyme is believed to participate in the processes of angiogenesis, cancer metastasis, and inflammation (2). The βG is known to activate prodrugs (PDs) for the treatment of cancer. βG also has been used to track the path of gene delivery vehicles, and there is evidence that it can be used as a biomarker to detect cancerous tumors (3). Normal tissues have low levels of βG in the ECM, but tissues under pathological stress, such as bacterial infection, fibrosis, or malignancy, show elevated levels of the enzyme (4). As a result of cell lysis, intracellular βG is released from the necrotic parts of neoplastic tumors, and its activity in these lesions has been utilized for the
