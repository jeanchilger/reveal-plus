Synthesis and evaluation of a fluorine-18 labeled antisense oligonucleotide as a potential PET tracer for iNOS mRNA expression. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is overexpressed in inflammatory bowel diseases. An antisense oligonucleotide with good hybridization properties for iNOS mRNA was selected using RT-PCR. The oligonucleotide was reliably labeled with fluorine-18 using N-(4-[(18)F]fluorobenzyl)-2-bromoacetamide. Cellular uptake and efflux of oligonucleotide complexed with FuGENE-6 were rapid, unlike naked oligonucleotide, which hardly accumulated. However, neither uptake nor efflux showed any selectivity for iNOS expressing cells. The oligonucleotide showed a high level of non-specific binding, which may have obscured its specific hybridization to iNOS mRNA.
