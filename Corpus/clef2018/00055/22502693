Feasibility of shrinking field radiation therapy through 18F-FDG PET/CT after 40 Gy for stage III non-small cell lung cancers. To explore the feasibility of shrinking field technique after 40 Gy radiation through 18F-FDG PET/ CT during treatment for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).In 66 consecutive patients with local-advanced NSCLC, 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning was performed prior to treatment and repeated after 40 Gy. Conventionally fractionated IMRT or CRT plans to a median total dose of 66 Gy (range, 60-78 Gy) were generated. The target volumes were delineated in composite images of CT and PET. Plan 1 was designed for 40 Gy to the initial planning target volume (PTV) with a subsequent 20-28 Gy-boost to the shrunken PTV. Plan 2 was delivering the same dose to the initial PTV without shrinking field. Accumulated doses of normal tissues were calculated using deformable image registration during the treatment course.The median GTV and PTV reduction were 35% and 30% after 40 Gy treatment. Target volume reduction was correlated with chemotherapy and sex. In plan 2, delivering the same dose to the initial PTV could have only been achieved in 10 (15.2%) patients. Significant differences (p<0.05) were observed regarding doses to the lung, spinal cord, esophagus and heart.Radiotherapy adaptive to tumor shrinkage determined by repeated 18F-FDG PET/CT after 40 Gy during treatment course might be feasible to spare more normal tissues, and has the potential to allow dose escalation and increased local control.
