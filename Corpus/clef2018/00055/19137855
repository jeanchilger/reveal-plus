Expression of bovine leukemia virus p24 protein in bacterial cell. Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a member of the family Retroviridae, genus Deltaretrovirus that has three important gene including gag, pol and env. This virus causes B-cell lymphocytosis and lymphosarcoma in cows. In the first step PCR product of gag gene of BLV isolated in different regions of Iran and BLV-FLK strain were cloned in to a pTZ57R/T vector, then insert were digested by BglII and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned in to pET-28(a) as an expression vector. For the expression of p24 protein, the pET-28(a) recombinant vector was transformed in BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli competent cell and after induction of the protein having been expressed by IPTG, the presence of gag expressed protein was shown in immunoblotting and SDS-PAGE system. With respect to the remarkable frequency of infection to BLV in Iran and the necessity of controlling it through vaccination with recombinant vaccines of gp51, manufacturing and applying the recombinant p24 protein are vital goals in recognition and distinction between infection and responses caused by vaccine.
