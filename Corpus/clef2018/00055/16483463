Cerebral blood flow changes in the different phases of migraine. The haemodynamic changes that take place in migraine are reviewed focusing on cerebral blood flow (CBF) data measured with different techniques in patients suffering from migraine with and without aura during the different phases of attacks and in interictal periods. Special attention is paid to the factors underpinning the conflicting cerebral blood flow data and to pathophysiological implications of the CBF changes detected in migraineurs.
