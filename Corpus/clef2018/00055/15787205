Change of dopamine transporter activity (DAT) during the action of bupropion (in depression). Bupropion has an antidepressant effect through blocking the dopamine transporter. By 99mTc-TRODAT-SPECT, we measured the baseline DAT activity of depressed patients. After 3 weeks' bupropion treatment we studied the change in DAT activity, which corresponds to the occupancy of bupropion. The average occupancy of bupropion on DAT was similar to the international findings at 20.84% in 9 depressed patients.
