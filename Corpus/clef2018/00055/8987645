A cellulase gene from a new alkalophilic Bacillus sp. (strain N186-1). Its cloning, nucleotide sequence and expression in Escherichia coli. Several alkalophilic Bacillus spp. strains were selected for their capacity to produce alkaline cellulases. Culture supernatants of these strains showed optimal cellulase activities between pH 8 and 9 and they were stable from pH 6 to pH 12. A cellulase gene (celB1) from the alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain N186-1 was cloned in Escherichia coli using polymerase chain reaction techniques. The cloned gene was present in a 2.539-bp HindIII fragment and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The coding sequence showed an open-reading frame encoding 389 amino acids. The amino acid sequence, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, permitted us to include it in family 5 (or A) of the glycosyl hydrolases. The complete open-reading frame of celB1 was cloned in the plasmid pET-11d and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), in which a protein of 39 kDa was obtained in the cytoplasm however, no endoglucanase activity was detected. A second construction in pET-12a allowed the production of a 39-kDa protein located in the periplasmic space of E. coli that had endoglucanase activity. The protein produced has optimal activity at pH 7 and 50 degrees C and it retains more than 70% of its activity after incubation for 1 h at pH 12.
