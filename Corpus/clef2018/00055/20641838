1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-[ There are two subtypes of cannabinoid receptors in mammalian tissues: CB1 and CB2 (1, 2). CB1 receptors are expressed abundantly in neuronal terminals in the central nervous system (CNS) and some peripheral tissues to inhibit neurotransmitter release. CB1 receptors are found predominantly in the striatum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. The CB2 receptors are present mainly on immune cells to modulate cytokine release. Both receptor subtypes are coupled through G
