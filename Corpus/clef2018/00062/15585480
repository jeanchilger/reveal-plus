Is 18F-FDG PET/CT useful for imaging and management of patients with suspected occult recurrence of cancer? Rising serum tumor markers may be associated with negative imaging in the presence of cancer. CT and (18)F-FDG PET may yield incongruent results in the assessment of tumor recurrence. The present study evaluates the incremental role of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the diagnosis and management of cancer patients with increasing levels of tumor markers as the sole indicator of potential recurrence after initial successful treatment.Thirty-six cancer patients with increasing levels of tumor markers during follow-up and negative CT underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT, which showed 111 sites of increased tracer uptake. PET/CT was compared with PET results on a site-based analysis for characterization of (18)F-FDG foci and on a patient-based analysis for diagnosis of recurrence. The clinical impact of PET/CT on further patient management was evaluated.Thirty patients (83%) had recurrence in 85 malignant sites (77%). For the site-based analysis, PET had a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 96%, 50%, 85%, 85%, and 82%, respectively, as compared with the performance indices of PET/CT of 100%, 89%, 97%, 97%, and 100%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the specificity (P < 0.05) and accuracy (P < 0.001) of PET and PET/CT for precise characterization of suspected lesions. For the patient-based analysis, PET had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 93%, 50%, and 86%, respectively, as compared with PET/CT with values of 93%, 67%, and 89%, respectively (P = not significant). PET/CT was the single modality that directed further management and treatment planning in 12 patients (33%).The results of this study indicate that PET/CT may improve the accuracy of occult cancer detection and further lead to management changes in patients with increasing levels of tumor markers as the sole suspicion of recurrent malignancy.
