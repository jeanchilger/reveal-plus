Role of video-assisted thoracic surgery for the diagnosis of indeterminate pulmonary nodule. A study was undertaken to evaluate the validity and efficacy of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for the diagnosis of indeterminate pulmonary nodules.Between April 2001 and November 2004, 57 adult patients (31 males, 26 females) with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary nodules by preoperative chest computed tomographic (CT) scanning were included in this study.A definitive tissue diagnosis was obtained in all 57 patients. The mean age of the patients was 66+/-9.8 yrs. The mean size of the tumor was 1.76+/-0.67 cm. 38 patients (67%) had malignant disease. Twenty eight patients (49%) had primary lung cancer and 10 patients (18%) had metastatic lung cancer from an extrathoracic primary neoplasm. The rate of malignancy was 65% in the tumor sizes equal to or less than 2 cm. Among primary lung cancer, most patients had primary adenocarcinoma (24 cases)(86%). Pathologic staging showed T1N0 (stage IA) in 18 cases (69%), T2N0 (stage IB) in 4 cases (15%), T2N1 (stage IIB) in 1 case (4%), and T1N2 (stage IIIA) in 3 cases (12%). In 10 patients (18%) who required preoperative placement of a localization hookwire with a string near the nodule, the rate of malignancy was 70%. In 7 patients with positive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), the rate of malignancy was 57% and proved to be falsely positive in 3 cases (43%). There was no operative mortality and no significant morbidity in all cases.We proposed that VATS, which is safe and offers virtually 100% sensitivity and specificity, should be performed for most small (<3 cm in diameter) and all indeterminate pulmonary lesions on the basis of these results.
