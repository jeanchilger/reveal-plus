Functional imaging of the AIDS dementia complex and the metabolic pathology of the HIV-1-infected brain. The AIDS-dementia complex remains one of the more common neurologic disorders associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Despite several advances that have been made in elucidating some of its clinical and biological features, pathogenesis is not well understood, and effective treatments are scarce. This article reveals the results of these studies and discusses how these different approaches have already enabled clinicians to study further the effects of HIV infection on brain function and to explore the functional anatomy of this important clinical syndrome.
