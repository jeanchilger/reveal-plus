Comparative studies of cerebral blood flow measurements and measurements of the size of the corpus callosum in patients with schizophrenia. In this study healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients of the so-called Type I and Type II subgroups were examined in each case with a morphological method to determine the size of the corpus callosum and with a method to measure a physiological functional parameter, namely, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). MR and dynamic single photon emission CT were used (in our case as differential method). The study reveals for the first time classified into subgroups of the disease, scientifically measured differences both in the size of the corpus callosum and in the distribution pattern of the blood flow. Whereas the patients of type I had an enlarged corpus callosum and increased blood flow during the task with which they were confronted, these organs were mainly smaller in size with type II patients without an increase in the global blood flow during the relevant task. The statistical data--averaged over patient groups--show these differences clearly, but due to biological scatter it has so far not been possible to arrive at a diagnosis in individual cases.
