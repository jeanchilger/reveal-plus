Selective intraarterial radionuclide therapy with Yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres for unresectable primary and metastatic liver tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the success of selective intraarterial radionuclide therapy (SIRT) with Yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres in liver metastases of different tumors. We also interpreted the contribution of SIRT to survival times according to responder- non responder and hepatic- extra hepatic disease.The clinical and follow-up data of 124 patients who were referred to our department for SIRT between June 2008 [corrected] and October 2010 were evaluated retrospectively. SIRT has been applied to 78 patients who were suitable for treatment. All the patients had primary liver tumor or unresectable liver metastasis of different malignancies. The treatment was repeated at least one more time in 5 patients to the same or other lobes. Metabolic treatment response evaluated by fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F18-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the 6th week after treatment. F18-FDG PET/CT was repeated in per six weeks periods. The response criterion had been described as at least 20% decrease of SUV value. Also in patients with neuroendocrine tumor serial Gallium-68 (Ga-68) PET/CT was used for evaluation of response. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their treatment response.68 patients received treatment for the right lobe, seven patients received treatment for the left lobe and 3 patients for both lobes. The mean treatment dose was estimated at 1.62 GBq. In the evaluation of treatment response 43(55%) patients were responder (R) and 35 (45%) patients were non-responder (NR) in the sixth week F18-FDG PET/CT. Mean pretreatment SUVmax value of R group was 11.6 and NR group was 10.7. While only 11 (31%) out of 35 NR patients had H disease, 30 (69%) out of 43 R patients had H disease (p < 0.05). The mean overall survival time of R group was calculated as 25.63 ± 1.52 months and NR group's 20.45 ± 2.11 (p = 0.04). The mean overall survival time of H group was computed as 25.66 ± 1.52 months and EH group's 20.76 ± 1.97 (p = 0.09).SIRT is a useful treatment method which can contribute to the lengthening of survival times in patients with primary or metastatic unresectable liver malignancies. Also F18-FDG PET/CT is seen to be a successful imaging method in evaluating treatment response for predicting survival times in this patient group.
