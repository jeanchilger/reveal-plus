FDG-PET in adrenocortical carcinoma. Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant neoplasm with a poor prognosis. Radical surgery of the primary tumor and of local as well as of distant recurrence is the only effective treatment, and requires accurate and early localization of recurrent tumors. In this regard, we prospectively scanned 10 patients with ACC, 8 during follow-up and 2 at primary work-up. In all patients PET scans from the neck to the upper thighs were obtained 45 minutes after injection of 370 MBq [18F]FDG. Reading was done visually, with the investigator blinded to the results of other diagnostic modalities. All known sites of ACC lesions showed markedly increased FDG uptake. In 3 patients, previously unknown lesions were identified by PET in the lung (one lesion), the abdomen (3 lesions), and the skeleton (multiple), respectively. One false positive liver focus was shown by PET aside from the true positive lung metastases in the same patient. The sensitivity/specificity of PET based on different organs was 100/97%, that based on the number of PET-detected lesions (N = 23) was 100/95%. PET altered or influenced the tumor stage in 3/10 patients, modifying the subsequent therapeutic management in 2/10 patients. We conclude that FDG-PET is highly useful in ACC and should be included in the work-up for initial staging as well as for follow-up.
