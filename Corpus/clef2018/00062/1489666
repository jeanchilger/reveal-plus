Activation of phospholipase D by endothelin-1 and other pharmacological agents in rabbit iris sphincter smooth muscle. The stimulation of phospholipase D (PLD) activity by endothelin-1 (ET1) was investigated in rabbit iris sphincter prelabelled with [3H]myristic acid. In the presence of 0.5% ethanol, ET1 caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in the production of [3H]phosphatidylethanol ([3H]PEt). Within 30 s the peptide increased PEt formation by 30% and after 5 min increased it by 140%. The EC50 value for ET1-stimulated PEt formation was found to be 30 nM. This value is appreciably lower than the EC50 we previously obtained for ET1-induced inositol trisphosphate production (45 nM), but considerably higher than that for arachidonic acid release (1 nM). PEt formation was significantly stimulated by prostaglandin F20, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), chloroform, A23187 and A1F4-, but it was not affected by carbachol or the platelet-activating factor. PDBu-stimulated PEt formation was blocked by staurosporine and it was not potentiated by A23187. Staurosporine had no effect on ET1-stimulated PEt formation. Our data indicate that ET1 stimulation of PLD occurs independently of protein kinase C activation, phospholipase C activation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and phospholipase A2 activation. In this tissue the ET1 receptor is probably coupled to the three phospholipases through several G-proteins, and this appears to be species and receptor type specific.
