Does regular follow-up influence the survival of patients with sarcoma after recurrence? The Miri Shitrit pediatric oncology department experience. Despite comprehensive management of pediatric sarcomas, only 60% to 70% of children become long-term survivors. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether regular follow-up improves overall survival of children with recurrent sarcomas. The medical charts of 107 children diagnosed with soft tissue and bone sarcomas were reviewed, of whom 29 relapsed. They were divided into 2 groups according to the way of relapse diagnosis: due to complaints/physical examination (14) or on routine imaging studies (15). All were followed by regular physical examination and imaging studies (chest computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and bone scan/positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan with fluorodeoxyglucose) at regular intervals. Analysis of the results showed that (1) regular imaging studies do not facilitate earlier recognition of relapse in children with sarcomas (2) regular follow-up with imaging studies does not influence overall survival of children with sarcomas
