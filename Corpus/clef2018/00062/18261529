Non-oncologic imaging of the larynx. Imaging evaluation of laryngeal pathology has been revolutionized with the development of multidetector CT. The thinner axial CT slices result in improved contrast resolution and the ability to perform multiplanar reformations without breathing or swallowing artifacts. This article reviews the use of multidetector CT in the evaluation of laryngeal trauma and in common and uncommon inflammatory laryngeal diseases. The imaging evaluation of hoarseness and recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is reviewed with emphasis on where MRI or positron emission tomography can offer additional diagnostic information.
