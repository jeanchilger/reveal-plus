Radionuclide studies of atherosclerosis. New Tc-99m-labeled brain perfusion imaging agents, such as Tc-99m-HMPAO, and Tc-99m-ECD, are developed and expected to improve the clinical study of cerebral perfusion disturbance due to arteriosclerosis. They enable us better images than I-123-IMP and more accurate diagnosis. Similarly, in the field of cardiovascular nuclear medicine, new Tc-99m-labeled compounds, Tc-99m-MIBI, Teboroxime and Tetrofosmin are available. Furthermore, I-123-MIBG, a tracer taken up in presynaptic adrenergic vesicles, and I-123-BMIPP, a new agent developed for the evaluation myocardial fatty acid metabolism, will mark a new epoch in the study of coronary sclerosis. In order to image atherosclerosis directly, In-111-polyclonal immunoglobulin G, Tc-99m-low density lipoprotein etc., are under investigation.
