The development of peptide-based tools for the analysis of angiogenesis. Limitations to the application of molecularly targeted cancer therapies are the inability to accurately match patient with effective treatment and the absence of a prompt readout of posttreatment response. Noninvasive agents that rapidly report vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels using positron emission tomography (PET) have the potential to enhance anti-angiogenesis therapies. Using phage display, two distinct classes of peptides were identified that bind to VEGF with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity. Co-crystal structures of these different peptide classes demonstrate that both bind to the receptor-binding region of VEGF. (18)F-radiolabelling of these peptides facilitated the acquisition of PET images of tumor VEGF levels in a HM7 xenograph model. The images obtained from one 59-residue probe, (18)F-Z-3B, 2 hr postinjection are comparable to those obtained with anti-VEGF antibody B20 72 hr postinjection. Furthermore, VEGF levels in growing SKOV3 tumors were followed using (18)F-Z-3B as a PET probe with VEGF levels increasing with tumor size.
