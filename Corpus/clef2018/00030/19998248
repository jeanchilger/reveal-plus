Percutaneous cryoablation techniques and clinical applications. Once requiring surgery, cryoablation now can be performed percutaneously under image guidance, thanks to the development of small probes. Sonography was used to guide cryoablation performed surgically now, computed tomography and magnetic resonance images are typically used to guide percutaneous cryoablation. Intraprocedural monitoring helps those performing the procedure to treat the tumor completely, while avoiding complications. Percutaneous cryoablation has been shown to be safe and effective for many clinical applications including kidney, liver, prostate, breast, and musculoskeletal cancers. In this article, we briefly review percutaneous cryoablation techniques and clinical applications.
