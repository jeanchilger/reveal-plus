Gastrointestinal stromal tumor causing small bowel intussusception in a patient with Crohn's disease. We report a case of jejunoileal intussusception in a 42-year-old patient with Crohn's disease caused by a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The patient complained of vague diffuse abdominal pain for a period of 4 mo. Intussusception was suspected at computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Segmental resection of the small intestine was performed. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a gastrointestinal stromal tumor as well as aphthous ulcerations and areas of inflammation, which were characteristic of Crohn's disease. This is the first report of small bowel intussusception due to a gastrointestinal stromal tumor coexisting with Crohn's disease.
