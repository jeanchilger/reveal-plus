Enteroscopy and its relationship to radiological small bowel imaging. The field of radiological small bowel imaging is changing rapidly, as is small bowel enteroscopy. New techniques allow the depiction of intraluminal, mural, and extraintestinal features of various small bowel disorders, such as Crohn disease, small bowel polyposis syndromes, small intestinal malignancies, and celiac disease. For patients requiring repeated small bowel imaging, modalities that do not use ionizing radiation, such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, should be considered.
