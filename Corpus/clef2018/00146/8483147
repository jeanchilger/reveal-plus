Biliary cystadenocarcinoma. Apropos of a case. Biliary cystadenocarcinoma is rare biliary ductal neoplasm, usually occurring in middle-aged women, which arises in a healthy liver, with a better prognostic than other malignant tumors of the liver. We report a new case documented by echography, CT scan and MR. Echography showed multiple heterogeneous and septate masses with fluid-fluid level and dilatation of the intra-hepatic biliary ducts. CT showed multilocular cystic masses with internal septa and papillary excrescences showing contrast enhancement and no calcification. MR displayed a rather intense and variable signal in some parts of the masses on T1 weighted images, flasching on T2 weighted images, corresponding to a hemorrhagic fluid, confirmed by surgery. On T1 weighted images after gadolinium administration, the masses were less well visualized.
