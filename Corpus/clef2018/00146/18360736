Traumatic neuroma of the bile duct. We present the CT and MRI findings of a traumatic neuroma of the bile duct, which is not a true neoplasm, but a reactive proliferation of pericholangial nerve tissue induced by cholecystectomy. Previous authors have shown a dilatation of the bile duct without a nodule. In our case, a nodule was present, and it was markedly enhanced.
