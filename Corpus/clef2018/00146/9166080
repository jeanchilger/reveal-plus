Imaging appearances of ileouterine fistula complicating recurrent adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Enterouterine fistulae are rare and nowadays are most commonly due to pelvic tumours. We review the literature and present the case of a woman who presented with an ileouterine fistula following surgery and radiotherapy for recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma. The presence of tumour within the fistula track may also have been a significant aetiological factor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent method to demonstrate the site and size of the track and has not, to date, been used to identify such a fistula.
