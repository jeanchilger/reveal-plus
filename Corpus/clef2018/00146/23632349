The utility of esophagogastroduodenoscopy before endoscopic ultrasonography in patients undergoing endoscopic ultrasonography for pancreatico-biliary and mediastinal indications. Oblique-viewing echoendoscopes may miss luminal lesions. There is no consensus on whether to routinely perform esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) before endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Currently, practice patterns are variable and prospective data are needed.: To determine the proportion of clinically meaningful lesions detected when EGD is performed routinely before EUS.This was a multicenter prospective cohort study conducted at tertiary referral center and large community practice. Patients undergoing EUS for pancreatico-biliary and mediastinal indications were enrolled.The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful lesion found on EGD. This was a combined outcome defined as any lesion that would alter medical management, or impact the subsequent EUS examination.Two hundred four patients were included in the final analysis. Clinically meaningful lesions were found on EGD in 45 patients [22.1% 95% confidence interval (CI), 16.4-27.8]. Lesions that altered medical management were found in 32 patients (15.7%EGD before EUS may detect enough clinically meaningful lesions to support the routine performance of EGD before EUS.
