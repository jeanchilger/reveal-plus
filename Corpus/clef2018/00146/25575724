Primary liver tumors : hepatocellular versus intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC) are the most commonly occurring and important primary liver tumors. Originating from one pluripotent liver stem cell both tumor entities can occur in a cirrhotic liver and also in patients without cirrhosis. Several risk factors have been identified as causative for both carcinomas therefore, tumor screening is advantageous, especially for high-risk patients who could be diagnosed in an early stage to allow curative treatment. Surgical resection, interventional procedures and transplantation are available as curative treatment options when diagnosed in time.Common characteristic features and morphology in cross-sectional imaging by ultrasound (US), multidetector computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as screening aspects are presented and discussed.Recent findings show a better understanding of the carcinogenesis model of both liver tumors originating from one pluripotent liver stem cell. Further developments of modern cross-sectional imaging modalities, especially MRI in combination with diffusion-weighted imaging and intravenous administration of hepatocyte-specific contrast agents enable early detection, exact differentiation, staging and treatment evaluation of HCC and ICC ACHIEVEMENTS: In this article we discuss modern, multiparametric imaging modalities, which allow a complete and reliable diagnosis of the majority of these tumor entities.Contrast-enhanced MRI, using hepatocyte-specific contrast agents, is currently the most accurate procedure for the noninvasive diagnosis and treatment evaluation of HCC and ICC.
