Successful limb salvage of pathological fracture of the distal tibia caused by cancer metastasis. Pathological fractures of the distal tibia as a result of cancer metastases are rare. In particular, the management of intraarticular fractures of the distal tibia has not been established. In this article, we present a case of pathological intraarticular fracture with an extensive bone defect of the distal tibia that was successfully treated by limb salvage with a locked intramedullary nail and pirarubicin-impregnated methylmethacrylate. A 52-year-old patient with duodenal cancer presented with a painful swelling in the left crus. The condition was diagnosed as an impending pathological fracture of the tibia because of cancer metastasis. During radiation therapy, an actual pathological fracture of the distal tibia occurred due to an accident. Limb-salvage surgery was performed by removing the metastatic lesion, followed by using a locked intramedullary nail. Three distal and seven proximal locking screws were inserted into the tarsal bones and the remaining tibia. About 10 cm of bone defect was reconstructed by pirarubicin-impregnated methylmethacrylate. Consequently, good stability was achieved. One month later the patient could walk without any aid. Postoperative functional score was 77% according to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society criteria. There was no recurrence however, the patient died of lung metastases 4 months after the limb-salvage surgery.
