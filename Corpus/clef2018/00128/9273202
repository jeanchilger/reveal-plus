Prevalence of thrombosis in secondary antiphospholipid-protein syndrome. Antiphospholipid-protein syndrome (APS) comprises venous and arterial thrombosis, spontaneous abortion and thrombocytopenia in patients with antiphospholipid-protein antibodies (APA). Such antibodies are detected by immunoenzymatic (ELISA) methods (e.g. anticardiolipin antibodies-ACL) or coagulation assays (lupus anticoagulant-LA). APS in patients showing other symptoms of autoimmune disease is called secondary antiphospholipid-protein syndrome. The aim of the study was to find relation between history of thrombosis and APA in a group of patients with lupus erythematosus and lupus-like disease. Lupus anticoagulant was detected by a three step procedure using phospholipid dependent clotting assays and anticardiolipin antibodies were measured by ELISA. We studied 95 subjects (91 women, 4 men) suffering from lupus erythematosus (67 patients) and lupus-like-disease (28 patients). Lupus anticoagulant was found in 26, anticardiolipin antibodies IgG in 34 and IgM in 27 subjects. In a retrospective study 40 thrombotic events were detected in 36 patients deep vein thrombosis in 19, pulmonary embolism in 7, ischaemic CNS events in 13 and myocardial infarction in one. Thrombosis was present more often in subjects with LA (61%) and ACL IgG (52%) than in subjects without these antibodies (24%) (p = 0.004 and 0.015, respectively). ACL IgM antibodies were not related to thrombotic episodes. The ACL IgG antibodies and LA are helpful in identifying subjects at risk factors of venous and arterial thrombosis among patients suffering from lupus erythematosus and lupus-like disease.
