Deterioration of thromboses in primary antiphospholipid syndrome: TNF-alpha and anti-annexin A5 antibodies. To investigate the association between clinical and serological features of patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and TNF-alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R).ELISA was used for measurement of antibodies (Abs) and TNF-alpha, while IL-6 and sIL-2R were measured by chemiluminescence.PAPS patients with pulmonary emboli showed positive correlation between IgM isotype of anti-annexin A5 antibodies and TNF-alpha (r = 0.894, p = 0.041) and IgM class of anticardiolipin antibodies and sIL-2R (r = 0.900, p = 0.037). In PAPS with cerebrovascular insults, positive correlation was noticed between TNF-alpha and IgG isotype of anticardiolipin (r = 0.624, p = 0.040) and anti-annexinA5 Abs (r = 0.768, p = 0.006).Isotype analysis of antiphospholipid and anti-annexin A5 Abs and investigation of their association with TNF-alpha is important for differentiation of PAPS patients that are prone to further deterioration of arterial and venous thromboses.
