Placental protein 13 (PP-13): effects on cultured trophoblasts, and its detection in human body fluids in normal and pathological pregnancies. Placental tissue protein 13 (PP-13), one of the 56 known placental proteins identified till today, was purified from placentas obtained from women at delivery, and used to evoke antibodies against it. The purified PP-13 was lysed to peptides, which were sequenced, leading to the full-length cDNA sequencing and its expression in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis in databases showed homology to the galectin family. Of the various antibody preparations developed, a pair of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) coupled to the recombinant PP-13 (PP-13-R) was used for the immunodetection of PP-13 in pregnant women's serum with the solid-phase ELISA format. With a dynamic range of 25-500 pg/mL with no background in non-pregnant women's serum and men's serum, the ELISA test was suitable for the detection of PP-13 in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters. PP-13 levels slowly increase during pregnancy. In the 1st trimester, lower than normal PP-13 levels were found in fetal growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia (PE), and particularly in early PE (<34 weeks of gestation). In the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, higher than normal concentrations were found in PE, IUGR and in preterm delivery (PTD). Application of PP-13 to cultured trophoblasts elicited depolarization carried by calcium ions, followed by liberation of linoleic and arachidonic acids from the trophoblast membrane, and a subsequent elevation of prostacyclin and thromboxane. These effects were negligible when PP-13 derived from the placentas of patients with IUGR, PE or PTD was used. The results are discussed in view of the potential utilization of PP-13 for early serum screening to assess the risk to develop placental insufficiency, coupled to a differential analysis of the various pathologies by analyzing cultured trophoblasts.
