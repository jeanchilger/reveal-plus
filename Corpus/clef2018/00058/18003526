Assessment of PSF modeling in PET AWOSEM reconstruction. An evaluation of AWOSEM with a Point Spread Function model included in the system matrix for spatial resolution improvement in Positron Emission Tomography was presented. The algorithm performances were evaluated on an experimentally acquired anthropomorphic phantom and on two lung cancer patient data. The study confirmed that the proposed strategy is able to improve quantitative accuracy, but that the amount of the achievable improvement and the corresponding parameter settings are object-dependent.
