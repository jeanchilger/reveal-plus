Novel human monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor as an imaging probe for hepatocellular carcinoma. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many epithelial cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and is an attractive target for cancer imaging and therapy. We attempted a novel noninvasive imaging method to evaluate anti-EGFR human monoclonal antibody clones for determining the uptake of therapeutic anti-EGFR antibody in HCC.In-vitro cell binding of nine I-labeled antibody clones was compared in the human epidermoid cancer cell line A431, in three HCC cell lines Hep-G2, SK-Hep1, and HuH-7, and in the EGFR-negative control cell line A4. In-labeled or I-labeled 048-006 was subjected to cell binding, competitive inhibition, and internalization assays using A431, SK-Hep1, and HuH-7. Further, In-labeled 048-006 was evaluated in in-vivo biodistribution analysis and single-photon imaging in nude tumor-bearing mice.The 048-006 clone showed the highest binding to EGFR-expressing cells among the nine antibodies. In-labeled or I-labeled 048-006 specifically bound to EGFR-expressing cells with high affinity and was internalized after binding to EGFR. A431 and HuH-7 tumors showed high In-labeled 048-006 uptake, which was visualized by single-photon imaging.Radiolabeled human anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody 048-006 has the potential to be a safer imaging probe for predicting tumor uptake of anti-EGFR antibody therapeutic agents in HCC.
