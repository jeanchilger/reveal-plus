Evidence-based imaging in lung cancer: a systematic review. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. To assess prognosis, optimize treatment, and avoid potentially harmful futile treatments it is critical to have a complete understanding of the tumor's histology, molecular characteristics, and stage at the time of diagnosis. From the radiologist's perspective, the goal is to provide as accurate a stage as possible before the use of minimally invasive or invasive procedures to guide the site of biopsy and confirm a final pathologic stage. This article reviews the evidence behind the imaging technologies used in the staging evaluation of lung cancer.
