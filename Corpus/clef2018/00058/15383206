PET and functional anatomic fusion imaging in lung and breast cancers. Metabolic imaging with PET is an established adjunct to anatomic imaging methods in patients with bronchial and breast cancers. The functional anatomic fusion imaging with PET/CT can further improve staging and restaging of patients. PET/CT can influence the planning of a surgical intervention or radiation treatment at staging and in patients with suspected locoregional recurrence. The use of a PET/CT whole body imaging protocol may identify extended disease earlier than conventional imaging methods and thus influence treatment decisions.
