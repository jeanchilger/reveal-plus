Effect of calcium antagonist on cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in patients with hypertension and chronic major cerebral artery occlusion: a positron emission tomography study. To evaluate the effect of a calcium antagonist, nilvadipine, on cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism, we prospectively examined five ischaemic stroke patients, with both hypertension and chronic major cerebral artery occlusion, using positron emission tomography. The blood pressure showed a significant decrease after 3 months of nilvadipine treatment, the cerebral blood flow in the affected regions showed a significant increase and the oxygen extraction fraction showed a significant decrease. We conclude that nilvadipine is a safe and effective anti-hypertensive agent for patients with both hypertension and chronic major cerebral artery occlusion.
