The use of FDG-PET scanning in lung cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a very useful imaging modality that significantly contributes to the diagnosis and staging in patients with lung cancer. Additionally, FDG-PET has been shown to play an effective role to predict therapy response and to assess tumor aggressiveness as well as to define radiotherapy treatment fields. Further technologic improvements in PET scanners and new more tumor specific radiopharmaceuticals are likely to bring further benefits to the management of patients with lung cancer in the future.
