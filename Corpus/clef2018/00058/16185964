The underutilization of EUS-guided FNA in the lymph-node staging of non-small-cell lung cancer: perceptions of chest physicians in Wisconsin. Recently, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) published evidence-based guidelines for the invasive staging of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which shows the potential value of transesophageal sampling by EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA). The objective of the study was to determine the perceptions and the clinical practice of chest physicians regarding EUS-FNA as a staging modality for NSCLC.We mailed a questionnaire to all members of the ACCP in Wisconsin.Seventy-one of 173 members (41%) responded. Chest physicians were more likely to perceive positron emission tomography, transbronchial needle aspiration, transthoracic needle aspiration, and mediastinoscopy to be able to make a difference in managing patients with NSCLC instead of EUS-FNA (p=0.01). Of the 40 chest physicians who believed that EUS-FNA can change the management of NSCLC, only 8 (20%) have sent a patient for EUS-FNA in the past year. Our findings may not necessarily reflect the opinions of chest physicians in other areas of the United States.Many of the chest physicians surveyed do not believe EUS-FNA impacts the management of NSCLC. This limited awareness may represent a barrier to successful utilization of EUS-FNA in lung-cancer staging.
