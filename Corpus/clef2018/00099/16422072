A medical image fusion method based on fuzzy mathematics. In this paper, a method based on fuzzy mathematics to fuse multimodality medical images was presented. The improved FCM algorithm was adopted to segment images, and automatic fuzzy redistribution algorithm to define the subject degree. 16 different combinations of image tissues and 16 context relations, 256 models altogether, were considered. The result showed that the method had the great ability of anti-error and anti-segmentation interference and had the characteristics of robustness, quickness, and accuracy.
