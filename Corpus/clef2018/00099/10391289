Novel techniques of bidirectional Glenn shunt without cardiopulmonary bypass. We report novel techniques of performing bidirectional Glenn shunt (BDG) without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).Five cases of single ventricle and pulmonary stenosis (PS) complex were taken up for BDG without CPB. The criteria for case selection were an unrestrictive atrial septal defect (ASD), no atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation, and no other intracardiac defects requiring correction. A temporary shunt was established between the superior vena cava (SVC) and contralateral branch pulmonary artery (PA) for venous drainage during SVC clamping for BDG anastomosis in four cases. In case 5, a shunt was put between the SVC and right atrium (RA) for venous drainage, and modified Blalock Taussig shunt and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were left open until the completion of the BDG.Central venous pressure (CVP) increased to a mean of 22.4 mm Hg during SVC clamping, with improvement of oxygen (O2) saturation from 62.4% to 82.4%. After Glenn shunt, CVP and O2 saturation maintained at 13.2 mm Hg and 87.4%, respectively. Postoperatively, there were no neurological abnormalities and no hospital mortality.Our technique provides an excellent venous drainage with improvement of O2 saturation during SVC clamping. It avoids problems related to CPB and economy. It is easily reproducible, with excellent results in a selected group of patients without compromising the completeness of repair.
