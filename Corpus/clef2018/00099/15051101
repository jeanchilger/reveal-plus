Technique and indications in pediatric oncology. Positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Positron emission tomography is the last non invasive imaging technique introduced in clinical practice. Its remarkable efficiency for cancer diagnosis and for the optimization of the therapeutical management of adult patients in oncology is now well known. Pathophysiology of tumors being comparable, the same results are expected for children. Highly interesting reports have already established such good performances about lymphoma or bone sarcomas. Complementary data are necessary to define the optimal place of PET in the care of children cancer because PET can be regarded as only at the eve of its development with the upraising of new technical possibilities and new radiopharmaceuticals providing various and complementary informations about tumors.
