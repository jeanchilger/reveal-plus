Principles and applications of positron emission tomography (PET) in cardiology. PET in Mexico: a reality. Positron emission tomography (PET) offers the unique capability of measuring non-invasive by the regional myocardial substrate flow and the biochemical reaction index in millimol per minute per gram of myocardial tissue. PET also allows for the assessment or quantification of regional myocardial blood flow, cardiac metabolism, ventricular function, myocardial viability, as well as autonomous nervous system, research and evaluating of dilated myocardiopathy and of ventricular hypertrophy. PET's success is based on the radioisotopes properties, their very short half-life allows for the administration of large doses.
