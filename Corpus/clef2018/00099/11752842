Tests for the evaluation of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are a common problem. Different noninvasive and invasive strategies have been carried out in recent years to study the role of impaired myoelectrical activity, tone, compliance, transit and perception of the gastrointestinal tract. Esophageal barostat examination and impedance measurements have been added to standard clinical methods like manometry and pH-metry for the esophagus. Bilirubin measurement allows the evaluation of duodenogastroesophageal reflux and perception can be studied by gastric barostat. Electrogastrography and tenostat test are still research tools. Rectal or sigmoid barostat examination is a new research tool to study visceral sensitivity in the lower gastrointestinal tract. New methods--like functional MRI and SPECT--are promising features for the future.
