 Malignant melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer (1). Early and accurate diagnosis is necessary for surgery and successful treatment (2). The melanocortin (MC) system is a neuropeptide network of the skin, and it is involved in pigmentation regulation, cortisol production, and many other physiological processes (3). Most cutaneous cell types express MC receptors, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and prohormone convertases, and they also release MCs. Melanotropin-stimulating hormones (α-, β-, and γ-MSH) are derived from POMC by the proteolytic action of prohormone convertases. There are five MC receptors (MC1R to MC5R), which belong to the G-protein−coupled receptor superfamily. However, thesereceptors have been found to be overexpressed in melanoma cells (4, 5). α-MSH (Ac-Ser
