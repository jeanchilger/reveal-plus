Coincidence of active Crohn's disease and florid endometriosis in the terminal ileum: a case report. Crohn's disease (CD), a variant of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, frequently affects the terminal ileum and coecal region. The clinical symptoms are often subtle and depend on the inflammatory activity of disease. In women of child-bearing age, florid intestinal endometriosis can simulate CD. Moreover, current pathophysiological concepts include intestinal endometriosis as a putative founder lesion for consecutive CD establishment. The report summarizes clinical and histomorphological data of a 35-year-old woman with the rare coincidence of florid intestinal endometriosis and CD both affecting the terminal ileum. The patient was suffering over 10 years from strong abdominal disorders including constipation, diarrhea, weight loss, and diffuse abdominal pain. In magnetic resonance imaging-Sellink, strong inflammation and intestinal obstruction of the terminal ileum were found. The laparoscopy revealed further evidence for existence of an inflammatory disease like CD, but brownish spots on the peritoneum were found indicative for endometriosis. Surgical resection of the terminal ileum and the coecal segment was performed followed by histopathological investigations. In transmural sections of the terminal ileum, histomorphological features of florid endometriosis intermingled with florid CD was found. The diagnostic findings were substantiated with a panel of immunohistological stainings. In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that florid endometriosis persists in florid CD lesions and the putative link between intestinal endometriosis and CD is more complex than previously assumed.
