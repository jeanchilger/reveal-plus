Colorectal cancer endometriosis resembling stenosing extrapelvic: report of two cases. We present two women of 40 and 42 years with colorectal endometriosis, both with a history of pelvic endometriosis and simultaneous episodes of rectal bleeding with menstruation. In endoscopic evaluations detected a sigmoid tumor and rectosigmoid tumor respectively, which apparently corresponds to stenosing colorectal cancer of epithelial origin.
