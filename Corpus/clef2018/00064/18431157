Spinal cord metastases from lung cancer: detection with F-18 FDG PET/CT. Preoperative F-18 FDG PET/CT study in this 57-year-old woman showed an FDG avid lesion in the left upper lung without evidence of lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. She underwent a left upper lobectomy in June 2005 revealing moderately poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (pT3N0M0) and subsequent chemotherapy completed December 2005. Nine months later, a left parietal lobe metastatic lesion was surgically resected. A true whole body FDG PET/CT study in November 2006 for restaging demonstrated new FDG avid spinal cord foci, which were highly suspicious for spinal cord metastases these lesions were confirmed by MRI. Clinically, the patient recently developed back pain without evidence of neurologic deficits.
