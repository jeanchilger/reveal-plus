Decreased cerebral blood flow in neuro-Behçet's syndrome patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations and normal magnetic resonance imaging--a preliminary report. Involvement of the brain is one of the most important complications of Behçet's disease, but its diagnosis is difficult because of the lack of effective imaging tools. Therefore, technetium-99m ethyl cysteinate dimer (Tc-99m ECD) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain was used to detect abnormal regional cerebral blood flow in patients with neuro-Behçet's syndrome (NBS). Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT was performed to detect hypoperfusion areas of the brain in 10 NBS patients with definite neuropsychiatric symptoms or signs and normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT demonstrated hypoperfusion areas of the brain in all of the 10 NBS patients. The parietal lobes were the most common areas with hypoperfusion lesions. Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT is a more sensitive and useful tool than brain MRI for detecting hypoperfusion areas of the brain in NBS patients.
