Positron emission tomography with 68Ga-EDTA compared with transmission computed tomography in the evaluation of brain infarcts. The diagnostic value of positron emission tomography (PET) was evaluated in 41 examinations of 40 patients. 68Ga-EDTA was used as a positron source. The findings were correlated with those of conventional of CT scanning. A clearly pathologic accumulation of 68Ga-EDTA was detected in 29 of 41 PET scans. The precontrast CT scans were negative in 11 and non-conclusive in one patient. CT after administration of contrast medium was performed in 29 patients. Of these, 21 had a clearly pathologic PET scan and 14 had visible contrast enhancement on CT examination. The injury of the blood-brain barrier thus was better demonstrated with PET than with CT. The topologic diagnosis was, however, better demonstrated at CT. It seems that CT and PET are supplementary examinations and that PET is superior to CT in the detection of injury of or absence of the blood-brain barrier.
