Regional cerebral blood flow in pediatric moyamoya disease: age-dependent decline in specific regions. Thirteen pediatric patients (ages 4-13 years) who underwent surgical treatment were examined regarding their rCBF in the preoperative periods. The postoperative rCBF was measured 39 times in these 13 patients. Thirteen healthy normal subjects (ages from 6 to 21 years) were also examined. The rCBF in the operculum and in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes was measured with 133Xe inhalation method and single photon emission computed tomography. In the parietal and occipital lobes, the preoperative rCBF had a negative and significant correlation with their ages, but not in the operculum or frontal lobe. However, subsequent to the surgical treatment, the rCBF increased significantly in the patients 5 years old or less, and then post-operative rCBF values had significant negative correlations with age in each region.
