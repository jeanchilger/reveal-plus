Primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: clinical features and analysis of personal cases. We studied 11 patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), basing our diagnosis on Harris's clinical and serological criteria. Analysis of these cases brought to light a number of symptoms that have a statistically significant association with PAPS. Although these symptoms have not yet been recognized internationally as diagnostic criteria, we anticipate that they will be included on a revised and lengthened list of clinical symptoms used for the diagnosis of PAPS. There was a high incidence of neurological symptoms in our case group: disorders were often observed before the onset of full-blown disease and could be confirmed by means of cerebral NMR and SPECT analysis. We believe that further investigation will enable researchers to determine the predictive value of these PAPS-related neurological disorders.
