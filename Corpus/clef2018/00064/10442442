Regional cerebral blood flow and depersonalization after tetrahydrocannabinol administration. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between depersonalization induced by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and regional brain activation.Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by means of positron emission tomography (PET) in 59 normal right-handed volunteers before and following intravenous infusions of THC.After THC, CBF showed a global increase which was more marked in the right hemisphere, frontal lobes and anterior cingulate.Regression analyses showed positive correlations between the right frontal and anterior cingulate and depersonalization.
