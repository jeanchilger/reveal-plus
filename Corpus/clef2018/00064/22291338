18F-FDG PET/CT features of pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma. Pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma (PSH) has been reported to show increased FDG uptake and be potential false-positives on 18F-FDG PET/CT examination. However, it is still unclear whether the previously-reported high FDG uptake is a universal characteristic of PSH, and furthermore, there have been no investigations on what kind of radiologic or histologic features may have been related with its FDG uptake values.To investigate the 18F-FDG PET/CT features of pulmonary sclerosing hemangiomas (PSHs), and to evaluate the relating factors with their FDG uptake values.We identified 10 PSHs in eight patients who had a pathologic diagnosis and available antecedent 18F-FDG PET/CT images. 18F-FDG PET/CT images were investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively, along with their histopathologic features. Correlation between 18F-FDG PET features and radiologic as well as histopathologic features were also evaluated.Mean diameter of the 10 PSHs in our study was 16.9 mm ± 6.26 (range 5-25 mm). Four tumors showed intense uptake, and four tumors showed moderate uptake on 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. In the remaining two tumors, there were no significant FDG uptakes. The SUVmax of tumors ranged from 0.60-4.7 (median 2.30 2.51 ± 1.42), and was significantly correlated with the tumor size (r = 0.754, P = 0.012) and three out of four tumors ≥2 cm (75%) showed intense FDG uptake and their SUVmax values were greater than 2.5. Immunohistochemical results for GLUT-1, GLUT-4, and Ki-67 and other pathologic features were not correlated with the tumors' FDG uptake.The majority of PSHs show increased FDG uptakes, and their SUVmax values are significantly correlated with their tumor size. PSH ≥2 cm can frequently be falsely interpreted as malignancy in FDG-PET/CT. Further studies with large study population are warranted to confirm our observations.
