Positron emission tomography in lung cancer. Carcinoma of the lung is one of the most frequent malignancies and a major cause of mortality. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) has been extensively investigated in patients with carcinoma of the lung and has established clinical utility and cost-effectiveness in characterization of solitary pulmonary nodules and preoperative staging of carcinoma of the lung. Evolving applications in carcinoma of the lung include detection of recurrence, assessment of treatment response, radiotherapy planning, and prognosis. In addition, there is developing interest in combined anatomic/metabolic imaging and new tracer techniques, in particular gene expression imaging. This review aims to present existing data supporting the use of PET in carcinoma of the lung and to explore the evolving indications and future prospects of PET and lung cancer.
