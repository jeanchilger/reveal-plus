Imaging developing brain infarction. Continued advances in neuroimaging technology have made it practical to image multiple aspects of evolving brain infarction during the potential window period of therapeutic opportunity in stroke. Recent methodologic developments include computed tomography angiography and perfusion, and the description of quantitative parameters for magnetic resonance blood oxygen level-dependent perfusion imaging. In pathophysiologic studies, metabolism and function in the ischemic focus and the peri-infarct tissue have been further characterized. Clinical studies have focused on the applications of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for prethrombolysis patient selection. These methods have an important role in the evaluation and development of new pharmaceutical agents and will be increasingly used in clinical practice as new therapies become available.
