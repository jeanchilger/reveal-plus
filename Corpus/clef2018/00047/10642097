Quantitative perfusion imaging in carotid artery stenosis using dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Quantitative, multislice dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI perfusion measurements were used to determine the patterns of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and normalized first moment of the tissue deltaR2-time curve (N) in 11 subjects with carotid artery occlusion or stenosis. MTT correlated with degree of carotid stenosis, whereas a range of alterations in CBF and CBV were found presumably reflecting variables degrees of collateral flow. There was no significant correlation between MRI and SPET flow perfusion measurements, with increasing disparity between the two techniques at higher inter-hemispheric flow ratios. The effect of obtaining the arterial input function (AIF) from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) ipsilateral or contralateral to the stenosis was determined. Despite the use of an AIF from the MCA, which is distal to the circle of Willis, and hence the major sources of collateral supply, there was still some extra dispersion of the contrast agent bolus due to differences in arrival time.
