16α-[ Estrogens and progestins are endogenous hormones that produce many physiological effects. Estrogens act primarily by regulating gene expression. Estrogen receptors are found in the cell nucleus of the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, bone, liver, and other tissues, and also in various tissues in men. Estrogens are lipophilic that they enter the cell passively by diffusion through the cellular membrane. They bind to estrogen receptors that are present in the nucleus. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. About 33% of women who have this disease will die of disseminated breast cancer. The growth of breast epithelial cells is dependent on estrogen stimulation to induce progestin receptor expression. Two-thirds of breast carcinomas express ERs. It has also been established that the ER status of the tumor is an important prognostic indicator in breast cancer (1). Women with ER-positive breast tumors have a better prognosis than women with ER-negative tumors in terms of responsiveness to anti-estrogen treatment. ER content in breast cancer was assessed by receptor binding assays, which suffer from inter-assay variability and are also limited by intrinsic receptor heterogeneity of the tumor. 16α-[
