Technology related parameters affecting quantification in positron emission tomography imaging. Some of the issues associated with positron emission tomography (PET) technology which still pose challenges for the recovery of quantitative images are discussed. Through these issues reference to what is today considered as the 'gold standard' in quantitative PET imaging is also presented. A brief comparison of 2-D and 3-D PET is given, together with a short discussion of combined PET/CT imaging devices.
