The use and misuse of positron emission tomography in lung cancer evaluation. This article discusses the potential benefits and limitations of positron emission tomography (PET) for characterizing lung nodules, staging the mediastinum, identifying occult distant metastasis, determining prognosis and treatment response, guiding plans for radiation therapy, restaging during and after treatment, and selecting targets for tissue sampling. The key findings from the medical literature are presented regarding the capabilities and fallibilities of PET in lung cancer evaluation, including characterization of pulmonary nodules and staging in patients with known or suspected non-small-cell lung cancer. The discussion is limited to PET imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose.
