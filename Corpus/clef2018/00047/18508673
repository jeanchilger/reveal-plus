Angiogenesis and inflammation in carotid atherosclerosis. Carotid atherosclerosis is a leading cause of cerebrovascular events. The control of cardiovascular risk factors, i.e. tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes and obesity proved to reduce number of fatal and non-fatal strokes but failed to prevent important number of them. Screening for biomarkers in individuals at high risk of symptomatic vascular disease helped to identify some of them. However, as disease is by its nature multifocal, global testing for biomarkers may have limited practical application. New imaging techniques, including direct visualization of artery metabolism, by 18-FDG-PET, has brought new tools to study local atherosclerosis progression and individual plaque metabolic activity. Advances in molecular biology helped to identify inflammatory genes and its strong link to angiogenesis. The later, is thought to play a key role in the transformation to unstable plaque. Studies of the complex role that plays angiogenesis in plaque development will help in future to design effective therapies addressed at the individual cell level. The purpose of the review is to bring new insights into complicated pathophysiology of carotid atherosclerosis.
