Electrocardiography of the normal domestic pet rabbit. To establish a well-tolerated technique for recording electrocardiograms (ECGs) and a reference range for the normal pet rabbit ECG, 46 healthy pet rabbits were studied. The following reference ranges were calculated. Heart rate was 198 to 330 bpm. P waves had a duration of 0.01 to 0.05 seconds and an amplitude of 0.04 to 0.12 mV. The P-R interval was 0.04 to 0.08 seconds and the duration of the QRS complex was 0.02 to 0.06 seconds. The amplitude of the R wave was 0.03 to 0.39 mV. The Q-T interval was 0.08 to 0.16 seconds. The amplitude of the T wave was 0.05 to 0.17 mV. Mean electrical axis was found to be -43° to +80°. Evidence of variation due to breed or bodyweight was not found to be significant, except for a quadratic relationship between R wave amplitude and bodyweight. The ECG recording technique used in this study for pet rabbits was well tolerated and shown to be both reliable and repeatable.
