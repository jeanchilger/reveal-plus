Cancer prevention in Asia: resource-stratified guidelines from the Asian Oncology Summit 2013. With economic growth in Asia, cancer has become increasingly prominent as a major health problem. However, discrepancies in infrastructure, economics, and development exist within and between Asian countries. We assess means of primary and secondary prevention for cervical, breast, colorectal, and hepatocellular cancer, and offer recommendations according to resource levels. Primary prevention by health education, lifestyle modification, and avoidance of risk factors should be made available at all resource levels. When resources allow, human papillomavirus and hepatitis B vaccinations should be given to reduce the risk of cervical and hepatocellular cancer, and genetic testing should be offered to detect increased susceptibility to colorectal and breast cancer. Secondary prevention by effective yet affordable screening for precancerous lesions or by early detection of cancer should be offered, followed by appropriate treatment.
