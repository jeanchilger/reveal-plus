Self-sampling of the vaginal fluid at home combined with high-risk HPV testing. Around 65% of women with cervical carcinoma in Sweden have not attended an organised screening. We therefore investigated the value of using self-sampling at home in combination with a test for high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) to increase participation.A total of 2829 women 30-58 years old, who had not attended the organised screening for > or = 6 years, were recruited. They were offered self-sampling at home (Qvintip) and recommended to send the collected vaginal fluid to a laboratory for analysis of the presence of high-risk HPV (Hybrid Capture 2 method).A total of 39.1% of the women accepted home sampling. These women disclosed a relatively high prevalence of high-risk HPV, which decreased with age, from 11.1% in women 30-39 years old to 2.9% in women > or =50 years . Follow-up disclosed histological cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN) 2-3 lesions in 43.2% of the women with a persistent HPV infection, corresponding to 2.0% of the total number of participating women. The sensitivity of a single smear to detect the histological CIN 2-3 lesions were only 52.6%, even if all abnormal smears (atypical squamous cells of unknown significance (ASCUS)-CIN 3)) were included.The use of self-sampling at home in combination with testing for high-risk HPV increases the participation rate of the organised screening and detects almost twice as many women with pre-malignant cell alterations (CIN 2-3) in comparison those with a single cytological smear.
