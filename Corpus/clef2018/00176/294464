A familial bisatellited extra metacentric microchromosome in man. A bisatellited, extra metacentric microchromosome was found in a normal male and his father. This extra marker participated in satellite association in over 50 percent of the cells silver-staining revealed only one active NOR region. Other banding studies identified two other cytogenetic "markers" in the family-a 9qh+ and a 21s+. Risk for a carrier of such a microchromosome is probably low but cytogenetic amniocentesis is recommended to rule out aneuploidy in the fetus.
