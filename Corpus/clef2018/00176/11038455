The influence of parity and gravidity on first trimester markers of chromosomal abnormality. We have studied changes in first trimester fetal nuchal translucency (NT) and maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A with gravidity and parity in 3252 singleton pregnancies unaffected by chromosomal abnormality or major pregnancy complications. We have shown that gravidity and parity is associated with a small but progressive decrease in fetal NT and a small but progressive increase in free beta-hCG and PAPP-A. None of these small changes with increasing gravidity or parity are statistically significant and hence correction for these variables is not necessary when considering first trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities.
