Human erythrocyte superoxide dismutase in adults, neonates, and normal, hypoxaemic, anaemic, and chromosomally abnormal fetuses. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent method is described for the assay of human erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD). The method was specific and precise as well as simple, economical, and reliable. The mean levels of adult SOD with SD were 652 +/- 122 mg/kg hemoglobin (Hb) for males and 635 +/- 100 mg/kg Hb for females. In neonates the levels were 528 +/- 92 mg/kg Hb. Normal fetal levels at 20-36 weeks gestation were 421 +/- 90 mg/kg Hb. Mean SOD levels in hypoxemic growth-retarded fetuses and in anemic fetuses from red cell iso-immunised pregnancies (before their first intrauterine blood transfusion) were the same as those in normal fetuses. However, in a case of trisomy 21 the fetal level of SOD was significantly increased.
