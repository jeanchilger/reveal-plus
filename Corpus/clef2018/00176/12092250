Usefulness of fetal echocardiography in the prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome based on material from the Department for Diagnosis of Congenital Malformation's of the Institute "Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital' in Lodz between 1994-1999. Part I. Between 1994-1999 at the Department for Diagnosis of Congenital Malformations at the PPMH Institute there were ultrasound and echocardiography examinations performed in 40 fetuses with Down Syndrome. In our study most of the cases come from low risk groups of pregnant women. Congenital heart defects (AV-canal in 13/18 cases) were the most common anomalies diagnosed prenatally in fetuses with Down Syndrome. In fetuses with DS, functional cardiac anomalies with normal heart anatomy were recorded: disproportion and hypertrophy in 4/12 cases, tricuspid valve regurgitation, bright spot and pericardial effusion in 3/12 cases. The aim of our study was a retrospective analysis of fetuses with DS, which were diagnosed at the Department for Diagnosis of Congenital at the Institute of "PMMH" in 1994-1999 years.
