Discordance among blastomeres renders preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy ineffective. To investigate the contribution of discordance among blastomeres from the same embryo in the interpretation of blastomeres biopsied from day 3 embryos.228 IVF embryos had two blastomeres removed and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y. Of the 228 embryos, 102 had complete FISH results for both blastomeres.When the 2 blastomeres of 102 embryos with successful FISH results were compared, 26 (25.5%) were concordant for all 8 chromosomes and 76 (74.5%) were discordant for one or more chromosomes. Among the 102 embryos, 12 (12%) were disomy in both blastomeres and 37 (36%) were disomic in all 8 chromosomes in one of the two blastomeres.Discordance among blastomeres from the same embryo appears to present a significant problem in interpreting results of embryos biopsied on day 3 and analyzed by FISH especially when most PGD's are done on single blastomeres.
