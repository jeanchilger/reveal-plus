The genetic significance of accessory bisatellited marker chromosomes. Ten new cases of accessory bisatellited marker chromosomes examined in different laboratories are reported. As a basis for genetic counseling in the context of prenatal diagnosis a cytogenetic categorization of such marker chromosomes is proposed and an estimation of the genetic risk associated with each category is carried out. The results are as follows: There is no increased risk for offspring with abnormal phenotype born to a healthy carrier of an accessory bisatellited marker chromosome with either a single or two closely adjacent C-bands (Category AI or AII). The unbiased sample of cases with de novo accessory bisatellited marker chromosomes of categories AI and AII is too small to allow a satisfactory estimation of the actual risk that, in case of such a prenatal finding, the foetus may not show a normal phenotype as a consequence of the marker chromosome. There is, however, evidence that this risk may be lower than 10%. Accessory bisatellited marker chromosomes showing a discrete pattern of G- and R-bands situated between two distant C-bands (Category AIII) usually indicate a chromosomal imbalance giving rise to an abnormal phenotype. Mosaic carriers of such dicentric marker chromosomes may, however, present a normal phenotype.
