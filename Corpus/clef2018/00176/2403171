Second-trimester placental biopsy for rapid fetal karyotyping. Since January 1988 the technique of first-trimester chorionic villus sampling (placental biopsy) has been extended to include cases in the second trimester. To date, 40 procedures have been performed. The main indication for the late chorionic villus sampling was a low serum alpha-fetoprotein value in association with an increased risk for Down syndrome (n = 28), abnormal ultrasonographic finding (n = 7), and failed amniotic cell culture (n = 3). Successful karyotype results were achieved in all but two cases. Most results were obtained within 48 hours with direct cytogenetic techniques. No cases of mosaicism were found. The highest yield of abnormal karyotypes was obtained from the cases with abnormal ultrasonographic findings (one trisomy 21, two 45,X). One case of trisomy 21 was identified in the 28 cases of low serum alpha-fetoprotein. No spontaneous losses have occurred. The technique is easy to learn, does not differ from first-trimester procedures, and may have a lower complication rate than cordocentesis. The reporting of cases to the CVS Newsletter should help evaluate late chorionic villus sampling as another method for rapid fetal karyotyping.
