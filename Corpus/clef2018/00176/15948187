Characterization of six marker chromosomes by comparative genomic hybridization. We applied comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in six patients with de novo prenatal or postnatal extra marker chromosomes (MC). In four cases, MCs were mosaic and in one of them, the MC was detected in less than 50% of the cells. In three cases, CGH identified the origin of the extra MCs. In the other three, two prenatal cases and one child with an abnormal phenotype, CGH showed normal profiles. Among these cases, a normal profile and entirely C-band positive was identified suggesting that MC did not contain euchromatin. Genetic imbalances detected by CGH were as follow: a gain of 8p10-p12 in a boy with facial dysmorphism, hyperactivity and speech delay, a gain of 8q10-q12 in a healthy man with a history of spontaneous abortions, and a gain of 15q11-q13 in a girl with speech delay, and motor skill and object manipulation difficulties. Clinical data of these patients were compared with those reported in the literature. We conclude that CGH is a very useful and powerful tool for characterizing prenatal or postnatal MCs, even when the mosaicism is present and the MCs are present in less than 50% of the cells.
