Karyotype abnormalities in fetuses diagnosed as abnormal on ultrasound before 20 weeks' gestational age. This study examined rates of karyotype abnormalities in fetuses diagnosed by ultrasound as abnormal before 20 weeks' gestational age and which prompted a follow-up amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Those diagnosed before 20 weeks were compared with those diagnosed at or after 20 weeks. A retrospective study identified ultrasonographically abnormal fetuses in whom karyotyping had been undertaken, 306 fetuses before 20 weeks' gestational age and 241 after. Isolated malformations before 20 weeks had, on average, an 18 per cent risk of karyotype abnormality, compared with 20 per cent later. Specific rates were calculated for example, heart abnormality was associated with karyotype abnormality in 7 per cent of cases before 20 weeks and in 14 per cent later. Multiple malformations and karyotype abnormalities were found together in 28 per cent of fetuses prior to 20 weeks and in 33 per cent of the older fetuses. Specific associations included nuchal oedema and trisomy 21 in 21 per cent of fetuses before 20 weeks. No karyotype abnormalities were found in fetuses diagnosed with choroid plexus cysts. An overview of trisomies in Victoria, in 1991, showed that 50 per cent of trisomy 18, 42 per cent of trisomy 13, and 9.5 per cent of trisomy 21 cases were identified by ultrasound in women less than 37 years of age. Another 28.6 per cent of trisomy 21 fetuses were detected in women of advanced maternal age who underwent amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, making a total of 38.1 per cent of trisomy 21 that were detected prenatally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
