Maternal serum levels of dimeric inhibin A in pregnancies affected by trisomy 21 in the first trimester. Dimeric inhibin A was measured in maternal serum samples from 45 pregnancies affected by trisomy 21 and 493 samples from unaffected pregnancies at 10-14 weeks of gestation. Inhibin A levels in affected pregnancies were compared with levels of free beta-hCG and PAPP-A in the same series. In the trisomy 21 group, the median multiple of the median (MoM) inhibin A was not significantly elevated (1.28 vs 1.00) with only 15.5% being above the 95th centile. In contrast, the median MoM free beta-hCG was significantly increased (2.05 vs 1.00) with 36% above the 95th centile and PAPP-A was significantly reduced (0.49 vs 1.00) with 42% below the 5th centile. Inhibin A levels in the trisomy 21 group were significantly correlated with gestational age such that median levels rose from 1.04 at 11 weeks to 1.30 at 12 weeks and 1.67 at 13 weeks. These findings suggest that first trimester biochemical screening for trisomy 21, which is currently optimised using maternal serum free beta-hCG and PAPP-A and fetal nuchal translucency, will not benefit from the inclusion of inhibin A.
