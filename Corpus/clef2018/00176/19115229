First-trimester screening markers are altered in pregnancies conceived after IVF/ICSI. To determine the levels of first-trimester screening markers and to assess the false-positive rate for first-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome in a large national population of women pregnant after assisted reproductive technology (ART), in order to decide whether or not to correct risk calculation for mode of conception.A national prospective cohort study of 1000 pregnancies achieved after ART was compared with a control group of 2543 pregnancies conceived spontaneously. All women completed a first-trimester combined screening program. Risk calculation was performed retrospectively based on the screening parameters to avoid bias due to the use of different algorithms of risk calculation.In chromosomally normal pregnancies conceived after in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), the pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A multiples of the median value was significantly decreased when compared with that of pregnancies conceived spontaneously (0.78 and 0.79 vs. 0.98), while there was no difference in the group treated by frozen embryo replacement. There was no difference in the level of free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin between groups. The median nuchal translucency thickness was smaller in the overall ART group compared with controls. The false-positive rate of first-trimester combined screening in the overall ART group, adjusted for maternal age, was significantly higher when compared with controls (9.0% vs. 6.0%).It seems advisable to use a population of IVF/ICSI pregnancies to establish median curves for the first-trimester serum screening parameters and perhaps also for nuchal translucency thickness. However, care must be taken, as different ART treatment methods and aspects of medical history seem to alter the screening parameters in different ways.
