Prenatally identified case of mosaicism of chromosome 16 trisomy. We present the prenatally identified case of mosaicism of chromosome 16 trisomy. A patient with the pregnancy complicated in the first trimester by the threat of breaking was refered to the high risk group according to the results of the screening program. The ultrasonic research revealed a number of phenotypical pathologies in 19-weeks-old fetus such as congenital heart disease (ventricular septal defect), hyperechoic bowel, single umbilical artery and some other ones. Cytogenetical and FISH analyses of the placental villi revealed karyotype with chromosome 16 trisomy. The further research of amniotic fluid cells revealed the karyotype of fetus as mos47,XX,+16 / 46,XX. The pathologoanatomic research of the abortus has verified the multiple congenital malformations.
