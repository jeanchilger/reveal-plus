Trisomy 21. Second-trimester ultrasound. Not every aspect of sonographic examination reveals karyotypic abnormalities. Ultrasound examination of a fetus with trisomy 21 generally reveals normal amniotic fluid, normal placentation, and normal fetal growth. In addition, other chromosomal abnormalities have many of the same sonographic findings as Down syndrome, and many findings have a large overlap with phenotypically normal fetuses. The importance of second-trimester ultrasound screening for Down syndrome has remained great because of its ease of use and relative effectiveness. Trained sonographers can adjust the relative risk for trisomy 21 and alter the need for genetic amniocentesis. It is important that parents understand the limitations of a screening test and the risks and benefits of possible subsequent confirmatory testing. If a major structural abnormality is identified on ultrasound, karyotype determination should be considered. Nuchal thickness in the first or second trimester remains the most clinically useful marker for trisomy 21. The predictive value of all the markers depends on the population studied and can be modified by a host of biochemical markers and historical factors. If fetal karyotype analysis could be performed without sampling through the uterus, prenatal diagnosis could be offered to all pregnant women, and screening would be unnecessary. Despite its limitations, ultrasound will have an important role in prenatal diagnosis at least until isolating and testing fetal cells from maternal blood or other sources becomes practical and widely available. Whether used alone or in conjunction with additional biochemical or molecular serum markers, ultrasound is an important and powerful tool in prenatal genetic evaluation.
