Prenatal diagnosis using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): 2-year multi-center retrospective study and review of the literature. Since 1993, the position of the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) has been that prenatal interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is investigational. In 1997, the FDA cleared the AneuVysion assay (Vysis, Inc.) to enumerate chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y for prenatal diagnosis. Data is presented from the clinical trial that led to regulatory clearance (1379 pregnancies) and from retrospective case review on 5197 new pregnancies. These studies demonstrated an extremely high concordance rate between FISH and standard cytogenetics (99.8%) for specific abnormalities that the AneuVysion assay is designed to detect. In 29 039 informative testing events (6576 new and 22 463 cases in the literature) only one false positive (false positive rate = 0.003%) and seven false negative results (false negative rate = 0.024%) occurred. A historical review of all known accounts of specimens tested is presented (29 039 using AneuVysion and 18 275 specimens tested with other probes). These performance characteristics support a prenatal management strategy that includes utilization of FISH for prenatal testing when a diagnosis of aneuploidy of chromosome 13, 18, 21, X or Y is highly suspected by virtue of maternal age, positive maternal serum biochemical screening or abnormal ultrasound findings.
