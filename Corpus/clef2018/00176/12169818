Application of ductus venosus Doppler velocimetry for the detection of fetal aneuploidy in the first trimester of pregnancy. To test the hypothesis the application of ductus venosus Doppler velocimetry may serve as a screening tool between 10 and 14 weeks' gestation for the detection of fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities.372 consecutive fetuses were studied. Based on prior study, a chromosomal abnormality was suspected when either the nuchal translucency was above the 95th centile, or there was reversed or absent flow in the ductus venosus during atrial contraction. Sensitivity, specificity, and the negative and positive predictive values were calculated.There were 29 chromosomally abnormal fetuses. Of these 29 fetuses, ductus venosus blood flow during atrial contraction was either absent (n = 2) or reversed (n = 25) in 93.1%. In the chromosomally normal fetuses (n = 343), only 6 (1.7%) had abnormal Doppler profiles in the ductus venosus (specificity = 98.3%, positive and negative predictive values = 81.8% and 99.4%, respectively).The Doppler waveform of the ductus venosus was at least equal to NT thickness measurement for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities.
