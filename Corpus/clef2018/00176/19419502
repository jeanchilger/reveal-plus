Multidisciplinary approach in cystic hygroma: prenatal diagnosis, outcome, and postnatal follow up. The aim of the present study was to determine prenatal follow up and clinical outcome in fetuses born with cystic hygroma.A series of 64 cystic hygroma patients, who were diagnosed in the first and the second trimester of pregnancy, was enrolled. Associated structural abnormalities, karyotype analysis and pregnancy outcome were studied. Survivors were followed for their fetal outcome and prognosis.There were 64 new cases of cystic hygroma in 8524 subjects screened (0.75%). Thirty-nine (60.9%) were of non-septated and 25 (39.1%) were of septated cystic hygroma. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 25 (39.1%). The most common abnormality in non-septated cystic hygroma was trisomy 21 (10, 27.8%), and that in septated cystic hygroma was Turner syndrome (5, 23.8%). Associated structural malformations are common in cystic hygroma and overall survival was poor. Nine of the present infants were live-born and were subsequently followed up. Two had cardiac pathology and died after cardiac operation, two others were diagnosed with axillary cystic hygroma, had an excellent prognosis and responded well to treatment, and another two had cranial findings with mild neurological sequel. Only three cases had, at birth and in the follow-up period, no complications.Cystic hygroma is highly correlated with adverse perinatal outcome. Prenatal diagnosis and invasive procedures are vital for counselling with close follow-up after delivery for appropriate medical support. A multidisciplinary approach is strictly recommended in live-born children.
