Isolating fetal cells in maternal circulation for prenatal diagnosis. Fetal cells unequivocally exist in and can be isolated from maternal blood. Erythroblasts, trophoblasts, granulocytes and lymphocytes have all been isolated by various density gradient and flow sorting techniques. Chromosomal abnormalities detected on isolated fetal cells include trisomy 21, trisomy 18, Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) and 47,XYY. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has enabled the detection of fetal sex, Mendelian disorders (e.g. beta-globin mutations), HLA polymorphisms, and fetal Rhesus (D) blood type. The fetal cell type that has generated the most success is the nucleated erythrocyte however, trophoblasts, lymphocytes and granulocytes are also considered to be present in maternal blood. Fetal cells circulate in maternal blood during the first and second trimesters, and their detection is probably not affected by Rh or ABO maternal-fetal incompatibilities. Emphasis is now directed toward determining the most practical and efficacious manner for this technique to be applied to prenatal genetic diagnosis. Only upon completion of clinical evaluations could it be considered appropriate to offer this technology as an alternative to conventional invasive and non-invasive methods of prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis.
