Isolated complete congenital heart block diagnosed prenatally in Down's syndrome a case report. A newborn with Down's syndrome complicated by complete atrioventricular (AV) block, despite normal cardiac anatomy, is described. The congenital AV block was diagnosed in utero, and the characteristics of Down's syndrome were recognised after birth. Pitfalls in antenatal diagnosis and management of complete AV block in the fetus are briefly outlined. Identification of fetal karyotype in case of isolated congenital AV block is recommended.
