Establishment of multiple quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction assay and its application in rapid prenatal diagnosis of common chromosome aneuploidies. To establish the multiple quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) assay and evaluate its clinical application in prenatal diagnosis.Totally 170 samples were collected between May 2008 and July 2009 in prenatal center of Peking Union Medical College Hospital 123 of them were amniotic fluid, 9 were chorionic villous samples, 20 were fetal blood and 18 were villi from aborted fetuses. All samples were from women of Han nationality, with mean age of (34.1 ± 4.6) years old, and with mean gestational age of (19.6 ± 1.0) weeks. Cytogenetic cultures and karyotyping were made to every sample. Genomic DNA was extracted from the samples. The sequences of twenty short tandem repeat (STR) markers were designed according to the GenBank and references, including 6 STR markers in chromosome 21, 4 in chromosome 18, 4 in chromosome 13, 4 in chromosome X, 1 in chromosome Y and 1 universal marker in both X and Y chromosome. Each sample was amplified by two sets of multiple QF-PCR, which included 4 STR markers in each of 21, 18, 13 and sex chromosomes. If the result was uninformative, the third set of another 4 STR markers was added.(1) Karyotyping. Cytogenetic analysis were made for all the 170 samples, 151 (89%) of which were normal, and 19 (11%) were abnormal. (2) QF-PCR assay. 167 (98%) samples were detected by QF-PCR. The results were obtained within 2 - 3 days after sampling. 134 samples were proved normal by QF-PCR, which was consistent with karyotyping. Among the 19 abnormal karyotype samples, 18 were detected as abnormal(eight were 21-trisomy, three were 18-trisomy)by QF-PCR. Among the 167 samples, 150 (90%) were detected using the first and second set of STR mixtures, and 3 (2%) were detected when the third set of STR was added. The remain 14 (8%) were uninformative. (3) The diagnostic efficiency of QF-PCR. The sensitivity of QF-PCR in prenatal diagnosis of common aneuploidities was 95%, the specificity, the false positive rate, the false negative rate, the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 100%, 0, 5%, 100% and 99%, respectively. (4) Autosome and sex chromosome detection by QF-PCR. Among all the STR markers, D21S1270 and D21S1411 had the highest heterozygosities in chromosome 21, and DXS8377 had the highest in sex chromosome. The amplifications were stable.Multiple QF-PCR assay is a valid alternative in rapid prenatal diagnosis of common chromosome aneuploidies. With high accuracy, it can be used for numerous sample test in large-scale laboratories.
