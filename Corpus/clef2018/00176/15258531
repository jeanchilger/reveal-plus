Preimplantation diagnosis for aneuploidies in assisted reproduction. At least one half of oocytes and preimplantation embryos are aneuploid and have to be avoided from transfer in in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients of advanced reproductive age. This can now be done by preimplantation genetic diagnosis, which has recently become an integral part of assisted reproduction technologies and was shown to improve implantation rate and reduce spontaneous abortions after implantation. The experience of approximately 5000 preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) cycles performed for poor prognosis IVF patients have already resulted in birth of approximately 1000 apparently healthy children, suggesting that this novel technique is safe and reliable, and may in future replace the current IVF practice of preselection of embryos for transfer based on morphological parameters.
