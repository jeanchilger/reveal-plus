Maternal serum markers in screening for Down syndrome. The addition of two new markers in maternal serum, estriol and HCG, to those already known, namely the level of maternal serum alfa-fetoprotein and maternal age, considerably improves the expected results of a screening strategy for Down syndrome. The detection rate is slightly increased from 53.0% to 57.6%, but, more importantly, the false-positive rate decreases from 9.4% to 7.3%. It is our belief that, at least in women aged less than 35 years, a screening strategy based on a combination of maternal age and biochemical markers should be incorporated into antenatal care. For older women, the results of such a maternal serum test may refine counseling for genetic amniocentesis, as a much more explicit risk calculation can be performed than that based on age alone.
