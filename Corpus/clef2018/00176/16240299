Automatic analysis of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification products (exemplified by a commercial kit for prenatal aneuploidy detection). For use in routine prenatal diagnostics, we developed software and methods for automatic aneuploidy detection based on a commercial multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) kit. Software and methods ensure a reliable, objective, and fast workflow, and may be applied to other types of MLPA kits. Following CE of MLPA amplification products, the software automatically identified the peak area for each probe, normalized it in relation to the neighboring peak areas of the test sample, computed the ratio relative to a reference created from normal samples, and compensated the ratio for a side effect of the normalization procedure that scaled all chromosomally normal DNA peak areas slightly up or down depending on the kind of aneuploidy present. For the chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y, probe reliability weighted mean ratio values and corresponding SDs were calculated, and the significance for being outside a reference interval around ratio 1.0 was tested. p < or = 1% suggested aneuploidy and 1 < p < or = 5% suggested potential aneuploidy. Individual peaks, where the normalized area was situated more than 4 SD from the corresponding reference, suggested possible partial deletion or gain. Sample quality was automatically assessed. Control probes were not required. Having used the software and methods for two years, we conclude that a reliable, objective, and fast workflow is obtained.
