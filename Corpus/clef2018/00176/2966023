Psychological aspects of amniocentesis: anxiety feelings in three different risk groups. A review of the literature about parents' experiences with amniocentesis is given in the first part of this paper. In the second part the results of a follow-up study in Belgium are presented. Three groups of women who had amniocentesis performed because of advanced maternal age, a previous child with Down syndrome or a previous child with neural tube defect, respectively, were interviewed at home about their experiences. Anxiety feelings were different between groups but also showed considerable variation within each group. The overall psychological evaluation of the procedure was positive, so that the majority of the women would opt for amniocentesis in a subsequent pregnancy and would recommend it to others. Later follow-up contact by mailed questionnaire revealed that almost all women elected for their subsequent pregnancies to be monitored by amniocentesis.
