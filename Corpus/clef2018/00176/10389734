Cystic fibrosis and chromosome abnormalities associated with echogenic fetal bowel. To determine the prevalence of cystic fibrosis mutations and chromosome abnormalities in the fetuses of a heterogeneous population of pregnant women referred for prenatal testing for echogenic fetal bowel.Fetal or parental samples obtained after a second-trimester sonographic finding of echogenic fetal bowel were submitted to a referral diagnostic laboratory during a 2-year period. Results of DNA testing and karyotyping on these samples were analyzed to determine the prevalence of cystic fibrosis transmembrane reductase gene mutations and chromosome abnormalities.Of 244 cases tested, two fetuses were positive for two cystic fibrosis mutations. This rate (0.8% or two of 244) is 20 times higher than the general white population rate of one per 2500. In a third case, both parents were carriers but the fetus was not tested. Nine (8%) of 113 fetuses tested had one cystic fibrosis mutation. Of 106 fetuses for whom chromosome results were available, three (2.8%) fetuses had a chromosomal abnormality: two had trisomy 21 and one had Klinefelter syndrome. A fourth fetus carried a de novo, apparently balanced, 512 translocation.These laboratory results are representative of a broad spectrum of clinical settings and indicate a generalized increased risk associated with this sonographic finding. Therefore, when a second-trimester sonographic diagnosis of fetal echogenic bowel is made, fetal testing for both cystic fibrosis and chromosome abnormalities is warranted.
