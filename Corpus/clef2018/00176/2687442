Perinatal nonimmune hydrops: diagnostic ultrasonography and related aspects of management. Nonimmune hydrops fetalis may become the commonest form of hydrops seen in Western countries during the perinatal period, and it has at least a 50% mortality. This report describes five infants with nonimmune hydrops associated with maternal hydramnios and with congenital fetal lesions or disorders, ie, mediastinal teratoma, pulmonary leiomyosarcoma, Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome with omphalocele, fetal tachycardia, and Down's syndrome. Three of the infants survived the neonatal period and two of these underwent surgery for resection of their tumors early in the neonatal period. The third had an omphalocele repaired at 6 hours of age. The literature is reviewed with respect to the pathophysiology of nonimmune hydrops. Its diagnosis and treatment are discussed, with special emphasis on the role of ultrasound in its early diagnosis and optimal prenatal and postnatal management, and on the morbidity seen in survivors.
