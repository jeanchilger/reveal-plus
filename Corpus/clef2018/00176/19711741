The role of inhibins in functions and dysfunctions of female reproduction--Part II. Inhibins (inhibin A, B, total inhibin) play a very important role in the regulation of female reproduction. Inhibin A is produced in the ovaries, adrenals, spleen, bone marrow, placenta and fetal membranes. This peptide plays main role in obstetrics. Inhibin B is secreted mainly in ovaries and its function is focused on gynecology. In practice, evaluation of serum total inhibin levels can be important in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and ovarian tumors. According to current knowledge inhibin A can be used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, hydatidiform mole, threatening abortion, pre-eclampsia and pregnancy associated with Down's syndrome. There are requirements of further studies to clarify the use of inhibins in clinical practice of reproductive endocrinology.
