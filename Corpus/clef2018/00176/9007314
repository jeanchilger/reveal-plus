Trisomy 13/trisomy 18 mosaicism in an infant. Cytogenetic analysis of amniotic fluid cells from a 31-week-old fetus suffering from polyhydramnios revealed that there were two cell lines, each with either trisomy 13 or trisomy 18. We studied the origin and mechanism for formation of this unique mixoploidy by tracing chromosomal heteromorphisms as genetic markers, and showed no discordance of parent-child transmission between the two cell lines in any of the heteromorphisms examined. The result indicated that the mixoploidy is not chimerism but mosaicism and that the mechanism of mosaic development is most likely due to two non-disjunctional events which had occurred independently at the two-cell stage of the zygote. A girl was born at the 38th gestational week and her clinical features were mainly those for trisomy 13. Chromosome analysis of the newborn confirmed +13/+18 mosaicism in fibroblasts from the skin and chorionic plate, while cord blood lymphocytes and chorionic villus cells showed only the +18 cell line.
