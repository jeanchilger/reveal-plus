First trimester ultrasonography of multiple gestations: a review. The objective was to review current literature pertaining to first trimester ultrasonography of multiple gestations. To this goal, all manuscripts published in the English language regarding this topic were selected and reviewed in a MEDLINE search from 1966 through May 1998. Additional sources were identified through cross-referencing. Current widespread application of first trimester ultrasonography and especially transvaginal sonography has introduced a new dimension in both diagnostic and management aspects of multiple gestations. Application of first trimester ultrasonography in multiple gestations enables an earlier and more precise depiction of important anatomical details regarding fetal viability, chorionicity, pregnancy outcome, structural abnormalities, pathophysiology of developmental disorders (such as twin reverse arterial perfusion [TRAP] sequence), early sonographic signs associated with fetal aneuploidy (nuchal translucency and abnormal crown-rump length), and potential fetal growth discordancy. First trimester ultrasonography also assists in guiding operative procedures including: amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, and selective fetal reduction. Enhanced information obtained with high-resolution, first trimester transvaginal ultrasonography is rapidly becoming a standard for establishing critical information that will assist clinicians to stratify management of multiple gestations. Given the increasing incidence of multiple gestations because of various assisted reproductive technology modalities, it is important that obstetricians become aware of the potential advantages of first trimester ultrasonography in clinical management of multiple gestations.
