Hidden mosaicism for a structural chromosome rearrangement: a rare explanation for recurrent miscarriages and affected offspring? We found maternal mosaicism for an unbalanced chromosome rearrangement in a woman with recurrent chromosome rearrangements in the offspring. Hidden mosaicism may be a previously underestimated explanation for recurrent miscarriages and/or affected offspring, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis can be used to verify germinal mosaicism, to evaluate the recurrence risk, and to provide a possibility to achieve a normal pregnancy.
