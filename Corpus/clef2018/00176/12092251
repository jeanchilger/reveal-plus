Usefulness of fetal echocardiography in the prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome based on material from the Department for Diagnosis of Congenital Malformation's of the Institute "Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital' in Lodz between 1994-1999. Part II. In the years 1994-1999 at the Department for Diagnosis of Congenital Malformations at the PPMH Institute, there were ultrasound and echocardiography examinations performed in 40 foetuses with Down Syndrome. In our study most of the cases come from low risk groups of pregnant women. Extracardiac malformations were diagnosed prenatally in 25% fetuses with Down Syndrome. The most common anomaly from extracardiac malformations was duodenal atresia (13/40 cases--32.5%).
