Impact of first-trimester aneuploidy screening in a high-risk population. To determine the impact on maternal decision-making of offering first-trimester screening to women at increased risk for fetal aneuploidy.A retrospective chart review of all patients > or = 35 years of age at delivery who registered to deliver at Massachusetts General Hospital before (2000-2002 n = 1,604) and after (2003-2005The fraction of women who accepted prenatal screening and/or an invasive procedure increased from 1,122/1,604 (70%) to 1,751/1,915 (91%, p < 0.01) after the introduction of first-trimester screening. Fewer invasive procedures were done in the second time period, due to a decrease from 40 to 14% in the fraction of women going straight to an invasive procedure without screening (p < 0.01). Similar numbers of aneuploid fetuses were detected prenatally in the two time periods: 21/22 (95%) in the first time period and 22/25 (88%) in the second (p = 0.36). All 4 cases not prenatally diagnosed involved the patient's decision to decline screening or ignore positive screening results.The introduction of first-trimester screening in a high-risk population was associated with an increase in the acceptance of prenatal screening and a reduction in the invasive procedure rate without a concomitant decrease in the detection of fetal aneuploidy.
