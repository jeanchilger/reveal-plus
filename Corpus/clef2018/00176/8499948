Mitotic errors in somatic cells cause trisomy 21 in about 4.5% of cases and are not associated with advanced maternal age. The study of DNA polymorphisms has permitted the determination of the parental and meiotic origin of the supernumerary chromosome 21 in families with free trisomy 21. Chromosomal segregation errors in somatic cells during mitosis were recognized after analysis of DNA markers in the pericentromeric region and (in order to identify recombination events) along the long arm of chromosome 21. Mitotic errors accounted for about 4.5% (11 of 238) of free trisomy 21 cases examined. The mean maternal age of mitotic errors was 28.5 years and there was no association with advanced maternal age. There was no preference in the parental origin of the duplicated chromosome 21. The 43 maternal meiosis II errors in this study had a mean maternal age of 34.1 years-the highest mean maternal age of all categories of chromosomal segregation errors.
