Increased rate of aneuploid embryos in young women with previous aneuploid conceptions. To determine whether a history of a previous aneuploid conception increases the rate of aneuploidy among women having preimplantation diagnosis (PGD).Preimplantation embryos were tested for aneuploidy using FISH probes specific for chromosomes 13,15,16,17,18,21,22,X and Y. Using logistic regression to control for maternal age, we compared the rates of aneuploidy and other chromosome errors in 344 embryos from women having PGD because of a history of a previous aneuploid conception, 363 embryos from 42 women having PGD because of X-linked disorders and 1158 embryos from 135 women having PGD because of repeated in vitro fertilization failure.The frequency of aneuploidy differed significantly among patient groups for women younger than 35 (p = 0.003) but not for women older than 35. In women < 35, the rate of detected aneuploidy was 37.4% in the Aneuploid group, 20.9% in the X-linked group and 27.0% in the RIF group. (p = 0.0003 when the control groups are combined). The frequency of other chromosome abnormalities, as well as pregnancy and implantation rates, did not differ significantly among patient groups.This study suggests that a history of a trisomic pregnancy, whether or not it was a viable trisomy, is associated with an increased risk of another aneuploid conception at conception.
