Mosaic isodicentric chromosome 18q: sixth report and review. We describe a girl with a mosaic isodicentric chromosome 18q with discrete features of trisomy 18. She presented with prenatal growth retardation, prominent occiput, small face, high nasal bridge, large nose, thin lips, a perimembranous ventricular septal defect, and subsequent slow psychomotor development and slow growth. Amosaic isopseudodicentric chromosome 18q was detected in cultured lymphocytes: mos 46,XX,psu idic(18)(q23)[74]/ 46,XX[26]. Monosomy of the distal end of 18q23 could not be confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with RP 1l-565D23, one of the most telomere located probes of 18q23. Isopseudodicentric chromosome 18q is very rare. Most cases are mosaics. The phenotype varies. More or less distinct features of trisomy 18 and monosomy 18q can be found depending on the degree of mosaicism and the breakpoint in 18q.
