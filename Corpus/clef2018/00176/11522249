Prenatal diagnosis of chromosome disorders in Tunisian population. Cytogenetic prenatal diagnosis (PND) is under national health program in most developed countries, while it concerns a small part of population at risk in developing countries. Finance is common reason of absence of PND development, but socio-cultural believes play an important role in Arab Muslim countries. In this paper we report results of 3110 fetal karyotypes carried out in a Tunisian population, by cultured amniocytes analysis. It is the largest report in a Muslim Arab country in our Knowledge. Abnormal karyotypes rate was 4.18% classified in two groups: bad prognosis (3.05%) and good prognosis (1.13%). Common amniocentesis indication was maternal age. The highest predictive value was observed in balanced karyotype and fetal ultrasound findings indications. Maternal serum markers were not commonly used for trisomy 21 screening. Pregnancy termination that is permitted by legal and religious authorities was accepted by 94,74% parents. Information about PND outcomes was given by genetic counselling prior to fetal sampling, pregnancy interruption was discussed with parents at cytogenetic result announcement. The authors conclude that in order to prevent mental and physical handicap related to cytogenetic disorders we have to promote PND by education for population, genetic counselling and fetal ultrasound screening all three methods available in Tunisia.
