Co-variables in first trimester maternal serum screening. The objective of this study was to determined the influence of maternal weight, maternal smoking habits, gravidity, parity and fetal gender on the level of maternal serum marker used in first trimester screening for Down syndrome. A total of 2449 singleton unaffected pregnancies from two centres were studied. Maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations had been measured in all pregnancies, and pregnancy associated plasma protein (PAPP)-A levels had been measured in 924. All results were expressed as multiples of the gestation specific median (MoM) values after regression, using each centre's own medians. Information on maternal weight was available in 2259 pregnancies, on self-reported current cigarette smoking in 1364 (of whom 117 (8.6%) were smokers), on gravidity in 1371, parity in 1303 and fetal gender in 253. All three markers showed a statistically significant negative association with maternal weight (p<0.0005) and in the subsequent analyses MoM values were weight adjusted using standard methods. The median PAPP-A level in smokers was 0.81 MoM, a significant reduction (p<0.005) free beta-hCG was also reduced (median 0.89 MoM) but not significantly (p=0.17), and AFP was unaltered. The median AFP level in primagravidas was highly significantly greater than that in gravid women (p<0.0005). In PAPP-A the reverse effect was seen but it did not reach statistical significance (p=0.15) and there was no effect for free beta-hCG. Results of a similar magnitude and direction were found for parity. The median level of free beta-hCG was higher (p=0.0005), and the median AFP lower in female pregnancies. Maternal weight and, for PAPP-A, maternal smoking are important first trimester screening co-variables. Gravidity, parity and fetal gender also seem to influence one or more first trimester markers.
