Chromosome 14 maternal uniparental disomy in the euploid cell line of a fetus with mosaic 46,XX/47,XX,+14 karyotype. We investigated the parental origin of the extra chromosome 14 and of the two chromosomes 14 of the euploid cell line, in a case of fetal mosaicism 46,XX/47,XX+14 diagnosed at amniocentesis. Molecular analysis of five polymorphic loci of the short tandem repeat type was performed. Markers D14S43 and D14S49 showed the presence of maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 14 in the apparently normal cell line. The distribution of the markers analysed along the chromosome suggests maternal heterodisomy with a large isodisomic segment in the telomeric region, possibly caused by meiotic crossing-over.
