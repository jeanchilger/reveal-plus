Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein levels and prenatal diagnosis of autosomal trisomies. Pregnancies with fetal trisomy 21 have been associated with low amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein levels (AFAFP). This observation led to the suggestion that low AFAFP levels be used as a criterion for completion of a chromosomal analysis in patients who are not otherwise at increased risk for a fetal chromosome abnormality and in whom karyotyping might not have been completed for economic reasons. In order to assess the usefulness of such criteria, we reviewed the AFAFP levels of 90 cases of fetal trisomy 21, 23 cases of trisomy 18, and 10 cases of trisomy 13. These were compared with 2400 control samples with normal chromosome constitution. AFAFP levels were generally lower in pregnancies with trisomy 21, showing a median value of 0.72 MoM. However, 40 per cent of the trisomy 21 samples had AFAFP values greater than 0.8 MoM and 20 per cent were over 1.0 MoM. These data imply that over 50 per cent of Down syndrome cases might have been missed using a cut-off level of 0.70 MoM for completion of chromosome analysis. Using a higher cut-off level will leave only a small percentage of samples unkaryotyped. The distribution of AFP levels in trisomy 13 and 18 is no different from controls we therefore believe that fetal karyotyping should be completed in every amniotic fluid sample obtained.
