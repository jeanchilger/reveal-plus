Fetal echogenic bowel on ultrasound: is there clinical significance? Though echogenic fetal bowel has been associated with meconium ileus and/or peritonitis, it may be a normal finding in the second trimester. The purpose of this study is to determine which characteristics might distinguish fetuses ultimately having abnormal outcomes in a population at low risk for cystic fibrosis. Seven fetuses with echogenic bowel were identified: 5 fetuses < or = 20 weeks gestation (group 1) and 2 fetuses 20-25 weeks gestation (group 2) at diagnosis. Four of 5 group 1 fetuses had resolution of the echogenic bowel during the second trimester. One group 2 fetus had a persistent mass associated with growth deficiency and trisomy 18. The neonatal bowel evaluation was normal in the remaining 2 fetuses although echogenic findings persisted into the third trimester. In a low-risk population, echogenic bowel usually resolves without neonatal sequelae. Even when persistent into the third trimester, echogenic bowel does not uniformly herald an abnormal outcome. Echogenic bowel coexistent with other abnormalities (such as growth deficiency or structural malformations) may be a comarker for aneuploidy.
