Audit of maternal serum screening: strategies to augment counselling in response to women's views. Women's opinion on the maternal serum screening programme offered at one maternity unit in East Northumberland (1991-1992) was evaluated. The responses from 1,774/2,633 women showed a general acceptance of the test but 722/1,774 (40%) wanted more information and a third, more explanation. Recommendations, which included a 'gold standard' protocol, a video to complement revised patient information literature and a coordinator to facilitate interdisciplinary communication and training with support for midwives, were introduced. The audit cycle was completed by a repeat questionnaire survey of 2,489 women from the postnatal ward (1992-1994) with a 67.3% response. An overall improvement in levels of satisfaction with reduction in, but not eradication of, the need for more information and explanation had occurred. These findings have relevance to the current controversy surrounding the counselling implications of maternal serum screening and have led to the formation of a network of professionals to develop the programme in our region.
