The impact of rapid aneuploidy detection (RAD) in addition to karyotyping versus karyotyping on maternal quality of life. To assess the impact of rapid aneuploidy detection (RAD) combined with fetal karyotyping versus karyotyping only on maternal anxiety and health-related quality of life.Women choosing to undergo amniocentesis were selected into group 1, i.e. receiving a karyotype result only (n = 132) or to group 2, i.e. receiving both the result of RAD and karyotyping (n = 181).There were no systematic differences in time of RAD combined with karyotyping versus karyotyping only in terms of anxiety (P = 0.91), generic physical health (P = 0.76, P = 0.46), generic mental health (P = 0.52, P = 0.72), personal perceived control (P = 0.91) and stress (P = 0.13). RAD combined with karyotyping reduced anxiety and stress two weeks earlier compared to karyotyping only.RAD as add-on to karyotyping reduces anxiety and stress in the short term but it does not influence overall anxiety, stress, personal perceived control, and generic mental and physical health when compared to a karyotype-only strategy.
