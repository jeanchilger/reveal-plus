Uptake of invasive testing following a positive triple test for Down's syndrome. Are midwives different counsellors compared with obstetricians? A review of the uptake rate of diagnostic tests following a positive triple test was undertaken in the two maternity units of the Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Trust. In one unit, midwives were actively involved in counselling and in the other, counselling was performed by Consultant obstetricians. During the study period, there were 721 (7.1% positive rate) positive triple tests. Of these, 212 (29.4%) and 509 (70.6%) were counselled by midwives and Consultant obstetricians, respectively. There was no significant difference in uptake of amniocenteses or chorionic villous sampling with respect to the counsellor with an uptake of 60.4% in the midwife counselled group compared with 67.6% in the Consultant counselled group (p = NS). We believe the determinants of the uptake rate of a diagnostic test are patient centred if adequate counselling is provided. Midwives will continue to play a role in counselling and should be encouraged to do so to reduce the burden on obstetricians.
