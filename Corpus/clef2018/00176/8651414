The role of chromosome anomalies in the origin of reproductive failures. The results from chromosomal analysis of 185 couples, studied on the occasion of reproductive failures (RF), such as sterility, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths and malformed children are presented. Twenty nine couples (15.68%) with one of spouses--a carrier of a chromosomal anomaly (CA) are established. CA types include: aneuploidy--2, mosaic--5, Robertson's translocation--3, non-Robertson's translocation--7, and pericentric inversion--12. Recognition of genetic conditions is vital for accurate assessment of recurrence risks and in order in some instances, to provide specific prenatal diagnosis.
