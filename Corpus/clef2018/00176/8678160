Integration of genetics and ultrasonography in prenatal diagnosis: just looking is not enough. There has been a gradual shift of the focus of prenatal diagnosis from genetics to ultrasonography. We assessed our primary genetics approach to determine what would be missed without the genetics component.We evaluated referral indications for patients with normal and abnormal prenatal findings from Jan. 1, 1990, to March 31, 1995, and categorized them according to type of fetal anomalies and genetic abnormalities found. Discordance among initial indication, identified risk factors, and observed abnormalities was assessed.The proportion of patients referred for very-high-risk indications increased over time 13.5% of all patients (1992 of 14,725) had abnormalities. Abnormal outcomes were categorized as 26% chromosomal, 58% ultrasonographic dysmorphologic features, 11% biochemical or deoxyribonucleic acid disorders, 5% infectious, and 11% other. Of the cases of ultrasonographic dysmorphism (exclusive of the aneuploidies), 3.5% were ultimately determined to be syndromic and 2.5% to be discrepant, that is, having a different abnormality than the referred diagnosis. Including the whole spectrum of disorders seen, half of the abnormalities would not be detectable with even high-quality ultrasonography.A large number of abnormal findings were not consistent with initial indication for referral. Correct diagnosis depended on increased acuity provided by genetic pedigree analysis and recognition of syndromes. Diligence in the search for associated anomalies, aneuploidy, pedigree analysis, and syndromic abnormalities remain critical components in the differential diagnosis. The elucidation of unexpected findings suggests the advantages of early counseling and a genetics-based approach combined with tertiary rather than primary ultrasonography with counseling only when anomalies are detected.
