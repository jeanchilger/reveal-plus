Issues in counseling for Down syndrome. We studied the background information, concerns and specific queries of thirty-four families of children with Down syndrome. Majority of the parents were aware that their child has Down syndrome and has or will have mental retardation. However, most of the families were ignorant about the lack of curative treatment, chromosomal nature of the disorder and prenatal screening and testing options.
