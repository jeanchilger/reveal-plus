A controlled retrospective follow-up study of the impact of genetic counseling on parental reproduction following the birth of a Down syndrome child. Twenty-three couples who had received genetic counseling after the birth of a Down Syndrome child (DSC) were closely match-paired by race, religion, maternal age, paternal occupation, parental education and sex sibship order of the DSC with 23 non-counseled couples who had also had a DSC. When evaluated at least 1 1/2 years after the birth of the DSC or the genetic counseling, there were no significant differences between counseled and non-counseled couples in knowledge of general genetics or recurrent risks for Down Syndrome, initiation of subsequent pregnancies, or utilization of prenatal diagnosis. Knowledge of general genetics and recurrent risks for Down Syndrome among our post-counselees was poorer than that of two published immediate follow-up reports. Although 18 of 46 couples initiated at least one more pregnancy after the birth of their DSC, only three couples (2 counseled 1 non-counseled) utilized prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis.
