Crown-rump lengths in missed miscarriages and trisomy 21. To compare crown-rump lengths with karyotypes of missed miscarried fetuses and to determine a relationship between crown-rump length and trisomy 21.Chorionic villus sampling was performed on 129 consecutive missed miscarriages between 10 and 12 weeks by last menstrual period in patients >or= 35 years of age. Crown-rump length was correlated with the karyotype. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.Twenty-one of 129 missed miscarriages involved fetuses affected by trisomy 21. The crown-rump length was < 22 mm in 77% of missed miscarriages. Using a crown-rump length of >or= 22 mm for the prediction of trisomy 21 had a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 89%, positive predictive value of 60% and negative predictive value of 97%. At 10-12 weeks, the crown-rump lengths of missed miscarried fetuses with trisomy 21 was significantly larger (P <or= 0.0001) than that of the population average of missed miscarried fetuses.In women >or= 35 years of age, with a missed miscarriage, in whom pregnancies reached >or= 10 weeks from the last menstrual period, a fetal crown-rump length of >or= 22 mm has a high probability that the etiology of the loss will be secondary to trisomy 21.
