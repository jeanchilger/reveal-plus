Fetal hydrops in the first trimester associated with maternal parvovirus infection. We present a case of fetal hydrops associated with maternal parvovirus infection during the first trimester of pregnancy that sonographically mimicked findings associated with fetal aneuploidy. The transabdominal sonograms of this fetus at 12.9 weeks' gestational age were consistent with increased nuchal translucency thickness. Transvaginal sonographic evaluation of the fetus showed generalized subcutaneous sonolucency suggestive of early fetal hydrops. An etiologic evaluation identified serologic evidence of recent maternal parvovirus infection and a normal karyotype. The pregnancy ended in fetal demise. Our findings suggest that visualization of nuchal translucency thickening in the first trimester should prompt a complete sonographic evaluation for fetal hydrops, which, if identified, should lead to serologic evaluation for parvovirus infection.
