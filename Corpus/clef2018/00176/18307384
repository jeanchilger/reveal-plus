The influence of experiential knowledge on prenatal screening and testing decisions. Minimal research focuses on the process of decision making in the context of prenatal screening and testing. This paper outlines an important contextual influence on these decisions. Specifically, we propose that experiential knowledge, particularly about pregnancy, screening, and disability, has a significant influence on prenatal screening and testing decisions. Drawing upon 38 semistructured interviews with women, this study explored how women made prenatal screening and testing decisions. Qualitative data analysis revealed two types of experiential knowledge, empathetic and embodied, which played a pivotal role in women's thinking about the value of prenatal tests and whether or not they accepted the offer of screening, testing, or both. We conclude that prenatal genetic counseling could benefit from an exploration of clients' experiential knowledge, both empathetic and embodied forms.
