Retrospective diagnosis of trisomy 15 in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded placental tissue in a newborn girl with Prader-Willi syndrome. Paternal deletion of 15q11-q13 and maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 15 are the main causes of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). The finding of an UPD(15) is associated with increased maternal age. We present a retrospective diagnosis of a trisomy 15 mosaicism confined to the placenta (CPM) after birth of a girl with clinical features of PWS born to a 43-year-old mother. Chromosome analysis after amniocentesis, performed because of advanced maternal age, had shown a normal female karyotype. In peripheral blood cells molecular studies showed the absence of the paternal allele at the SNRPN locus and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis excluded a deletion of the SNRPN locus on both chromosomes 15. Trisomic cells were detected by FISH on nuclei isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded placental tissue using a DNA-probe specific for the centromeric region of chromosome 15.
