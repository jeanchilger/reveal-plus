Cytogenetic and molecular genetic characterization of trisomy 20 mosaicism in fetal blood and tissues. We report a case of mosaic trisomy 20, the most common autosomal mosaicism identified in amniocytes, ascertained in a woman referred for amniocentesis because of abnormal ultrasound at 18.1 weeks' gestation which revealed short femurs and nuchal thickening. Metaphase analysis of 98 clones revealed 47,XY, +20 in 96 cells (98 per cent). Trisomy 20 was demonstrated in 6 cells (12 per cent) in a total of 50 cells from two fetal blood cultures obtained after pregnancy termination. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of interphase nuclei utilizing a chromosome 20 alpha-satellite centromeric DNA probe revealed three signals in 57/546 nuclei (10 per cent) in fetal blood. Metaphase analysis of 167 cells from seven different fetal tissue sources revealed trisomy 20 in 32 cells (19.2 per cent). The percentage of trisomy 20 cells varied with tissue type, with the highest percentage (13/25 cells, 52 per cent) identified in the small intestine and lymph nodes and the lowest percentage (1/34 cells, 2.9 per cent) identified in a specimen of chorionic villi. Molecular genetic analyses utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-formated dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms demonstrated that the non-disjunctional event most likely occurred post-zygotically and that the origin of the extra chromosome 20 was maternal. This study is the first to demonstrate trisomy 20 cells in fetal blood, suggesting that mosaic trisomy 20 can be embryonic in origin. In cases of prenatally detected mosaic trisomy 20, examination of fetal blood should be considered, as well as study of placental membranes, skin, and urine sediment to confirm the karyotype and determine its significance.
