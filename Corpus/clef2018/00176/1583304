Collection of fetal cord blood for karyotyping. Cordocentesis was performed in 234 pregnancies (241 fetuses) for rapid karyotyping. The indication was in 86% of cases: abnormal ultrasound. The abnormality encountered were IUGR (85 fetuses) or morphologic abnormality of the pregnancy (130 fetuses). The other indications were maternal mosaicism, mosaicism in cultured amniotic cells, maternal age (late booking), fragile X syndrome, confirmation of abnormal karyotype obtained by amniocentesis. The fetal karyotype was established in 97.5% (6 failures), 18 karyotypes were abnormal in the group "abnormal ultrasound" (208 pregnancies, 8.6% 215 fetuses, 8.3%).
