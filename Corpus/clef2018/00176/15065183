The association between isolated fetal echogenic cardiac foci on second-trimester ultrasound scan and trisomy 21 in low-risk unselected women. To determine the prevalence of and the association between trisomy 21 and isolated fetal echogenic cardiac foci (FECF) identified in the second trimester in an unselected low-risk population.All cases with isolated FECF were collected by reviewing the antenatal ultrasound database for 3 consecutive years. In order to include all trisomy 21 cases for the same period, the regional cytogenetics database and pediatric databases were examined. A 2 x 2-table analysis was performed to establish the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of isolated FECF as a screening test for trisomy 21 in a low-risk unselected population.In the 3-year period of the study the total number of deliveries was 11,105, of which 10,769 (97%) had a routine detailed anomaly scan between 16 and 24 weeks' gestation. There were 311 cases (2.9%) of isolated FECF. Among these there was only one case (0.3%) of trisomy 21. In the same period, the total number of trisomy 21 cases was 14. Accordingly, the sensitivity of isolated FECF for detecting trisomy 21 was 7.1% and the specificity was 97.1%. Positive and negative predictive values of FECF were 0.3% and 99.9%, respectively.In an otherwise healthy pregnancy, the finding of isolated FECF on a routine second-trimester anomaly scan is normal and should not be considered as a risk factor for trisomy 21 in an unselected low-risk population.
