Women's decisions about maternal serum screening testing: a qualitative study exploring what they learn and the role prenatal care providers play. Maternal serum screening (MSS) is a blood screening test that detects fetuses with an increased risk for open neural tube defects, Down syndrome and Trisomy 18. Although most physicians offer MSS to their patients, discussions about the test are brief, usually lasting less than 5min.The short duration of these discussions raises questions about the quality of information women receive and whether their screening decisions were well informed. This article describes what women learn about MSS and from which sources, and the role of their physician in their decision to have MSS.We conducted qualitative interviews with nine pregnant women from Newfoundland and Labrador. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic coding.Women rely on multiple sources of information to learn about MSS, including prenatal health care workers, the Internet, and other mothers. Although physicians are influential in women's MSS decisions, they may not provide vital information about options in the event of a positive test.Unlike the scientific and medical communities which place greater value on rigorous, peer-previewed evidence based on research, women place greater value on information gleaned from more informal, accessible sources such as family, friends and the Internet. Prenatal care providers can aid women by directing them to credible sources of information and engaging in timely discussions about MSS.Understanding where women learn about MSS and how they make their decisions about testing sheds important light on the roles prenatal care providers should play.
