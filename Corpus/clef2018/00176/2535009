Selective birth in a dyzygotic twin pregnancy with discordancy for Down's syndrome. The discovery of a twin pregnancy by ultrasound at the intake procedure for chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis is not unusual because of the raised incidence of dizygotic twins at increased maternal age. Since the conception of dizygotic twins is genetically a separate and unrelated event, the risk of abnormalities in each twin is independent, but additive. In advanced maternal age, the risk of chromosomal aneuploidy in one of both fetuses varies between 2 and 6% [1]. This case report discusses the early prenatal diagnosis of twins discordant for Down's syndrome.
