Socio-demographic and healthy situation of children with Down syndrome based own observation. Family creates the atmosphere and conditions for the development of a child with Down's syndrome, is a place where are the links, and course of personality development of its members. THE AIM OF THE WORKS IS the comparison of the socio-demographic situation, pregnancy period, birth and state of infant in children with Down syndrome born between 1981-2008, divided into 3 subgroups: A - 100 children born before 1990, B - 445 children born between 1991-2000, C - 85 children born between 2001-2008, in reference to control group of 50 healthy children.Retrospective analysis consists of 630 children with Down syndrome treated in a subclinical specialist office. Documentation information grouped into 29 collective features (X1-X29) served for statistical analysis of results in Excel and Access programs of MS Office pack.Subgroups of examined children with Down syndrome did not differ according to the socio-demographic situation except in number of conducted cytogenetic examinations and the age of therapy onset. Distinction in reference to healthy children was noticed in the age and education level of parents, pregnancy period, birth and infant status, the amount of time spent in infant or pediatric ward.The examined group of Down syndrome children in reference to healthy children manifests statistically more presence of pathology in the pregnancy period (prematurity, miscarriage treat, intrauterus infections), birth and infant status which require longer stay at hospital ward. In the last 3 decades a positive change has been observed of Down syndrome child perception in the family, earlier diagnosis made based on cytogenetic examination, what consequently results in therapy onset in the first months of life.
