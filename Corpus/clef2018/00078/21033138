Feasibility of in vivo isotope labeled autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells monitoring post cardiac transplantation in a swine model of myocardial infarction. To observe in vivo stem cell distribution and viability after transplantation by noninvasive imaging of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) labeled autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells.Myocardial infarction was established in 8 swine by ligating left anterior descending coronary artery after anesthesia. Bone marrow (20 ml) was drawn through ileum. After isolation, mononuclear bone marrow cells were labeled by radionuclide 18F-FDG and intramyocardially injected into infarction region. Whole body planar scan and myocardial tomography scan were performed immediately, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h post stem cell injection. Viability and stability of radionuclide labeled stem cells were determined at 3 h post labeling in vitro.The labeling efficiency was (67 +/- 14)%. Mean dose of radioactive in marrow cells was (32 +/- 7) MBq. Trypan blue staining showed in vitro viability was (95 +/- 3)% at 3 h post labeling. After intramyocardial injection, labeled mononuclear bone marrow cell retention rate in infarction region was (83 +/- 6)%, (49 +/- 8)%, (32 +/- 6)% and (24 +/- 5)% immediately, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h post injection, respectively.Distribution and viability of stem cell after cardiac transplantation could be effective monitored by 18F-FDG labeled autologous mononuclear bone marrow cell technique in acute stage in this model.
