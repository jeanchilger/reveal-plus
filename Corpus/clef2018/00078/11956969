Steele-Richardson-Olszewski-syndrome: the relation of dopamine D2 receptor binding and subcortical lesions in MRI. We compared (123)I-iodobenzamide single photon emission computed tomography (IBZM-SPECT) for imaging of striatal dopamine D(2) receptors in vivo, and MRI in 32 patients with the clinical diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We found a significant inter-dependence of reduction of specific striatal IBZM binding indicative of striatal degeneration and of the absence of multiple signal hyperintensities in MRI age had no influence neither on IBZM binding nor on signal hyperintensities. We conclude that the presence of multiple signal hyperintensities should raise doubt on the correct clinical diagnosis.
