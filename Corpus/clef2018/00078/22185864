Advances in radiotherapy: from 2D to 4D. Imaging techniques are increasingly integrated into modern radiotherapy (RT). Multimodal imaging is used to define the target for RT planning and imaging technology is also being integrated into linear accelerators, with the purpose to ensure delivery of radiation with high geometric accuracy. The integration of imaging in RT calls for a stronger collaboration between diagnostic radiologists and the professions involved in RT.
