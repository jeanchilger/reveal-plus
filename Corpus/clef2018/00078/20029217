Relationship between cerebral hypoxic tissue volume and prognosis after stroke. Between 50 and 70% of stroke survivors suffer from severe disabilities such as paralysis and aphasia. Poor stroke outcome is a reflection of our incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and hence the capacity to implement appropriate treatment(s). We evaluated hypoxic tissue after stroke and patient condition severity and prognosis.Hypoxic tissue volume was quantified within 14 days after stroke. Patients were classified as hypoxic positive or negative. Patients were evaluated at imaging and 21 days later. Prognosis was assessed at 30 and 90 days.Significant improvement was shown in hypoxia-positive (vs. hypoxia-negative) patients (p < 0.05). There were significant positive relationships between the volume of hypoxic tissue and the improvement in specialized test scores at 90 days (p < 0.05 for both). Presence of hypoxic tissue within 14 days after cerebral stroke was related to recovery at 3 weeks and prognosis at 90 days.The assessment of hypoxic tissue volume after stroke may be useful in predicting patient recovery.
