SPECT analysis of recent cerebral infarction. We measured regional cerebral blood flow and [123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP) uptake in 16 patients with unilateral brain infarcts during the subacute period (Day 3 to Day 50) and again after 3 months. Our results show that the central and peripheral areas described earlier in the chronic period were already differentiated in the subacute period. The central area presented a short phase of luxury perfusion and a longer phase of IMP hyperfixation. The peripheral area showed both a slight regional cerebral blood flow decrease and an early IMP uptake decrease similar to those previously found in the chronic period. Contralateral regional cerebral blood flow during the subacute period, considered normal, was significantly lower than that during the chronic period.
