Analysis of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter from a tertiary care setting in North India. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is a worldwide concern as cause of serious nosocomial infections. We analysed 140 non-duplicate Acinetobacter sp. isolates from hospitalised patients in a tertiary care centre 87% were MDR and 20% (28/140) meropenem resistant. Metallo-β-lactamase was produced by 16 of these, detected by ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid disc synergy test. AmpC β-lactamase and efflux pump were present in 17 and 4 of the meropenem-resistant Acinetobacter, respectively. 9/16 MBL-positive isolates carried genes for carbapenem resistance as shown by polymerase chain reaction.
