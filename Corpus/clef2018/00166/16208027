Reduced levofloxacin susceptibility and tetracycline resistance in a clinical isolate of Haemophilus quentini identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. This paper reports the first case of Haemophilus quentini bacteremia with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and resistance to nalidixic acid identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. There was an S 84 L substitution in gyrA and an S 84 I substitution in par C. The isolate had co-resistance to ampicillin (beta-lactamase positive) and tetracycline mediated by the tet(B) gene.
