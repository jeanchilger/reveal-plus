Picornavirus, the most common respiratory virus causing infection among patients of all ages hospitalized with acute respiratory illness. We evaluated the prevalence of respiratory virus infection (RVI) in 403 illnesses of 364 persons hospitalized over a 2-year period with acute respiratory conditions using virus-specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays in addition to cell culture and serology. RVIs were identified in >75% of children under 5 years of age and 25 to 37% of adults. The molecular assays doubled the number of infections identified picornaviruses were the most frequent in patients of all ages, followed by respiratory syncytial virus and influenza viruses.
