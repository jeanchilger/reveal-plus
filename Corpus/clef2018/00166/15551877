Molecular epidemiology of nosocomial infection by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Molecular epidemiology applied to the study of nosocomial infection has been fundamental in formulating and evaluating control methods. From patients in a level 3 Bogota hospital, Klebsiella pneumoniae samples were isolated that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Each of 15 isolates was characterized microbiologically and by molecular characters realized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and by repetitive-DNA sequences amplification (REP-PCR). Antimicrobial susceptibility and ESBL production was determined in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. The beta-lactamases were evaluated by isoelectric-focusing and PCR. Twelve (80%) of the isolates were associated with nosocomial infection 11 of them were from intensive care units. The antibiotic susceptibility displayed 13 resistance patterns--87% presented co-resistance to amikacin, 53% to gentamicin, 33% to ciprofloxacin, 40% to cefepime, 67% to piperacillin/tazobactam, 60% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and 47% to chloranphenicol. All were sensitive to imipenem. Production of TEM and SHV beta-lactamases was detected simultaneously in most isolates by isoelectric focusing and 93.3% produced a ceftazidimase of pl 8.2 of the SHV-5 type. The 15 isolates were grouped into 11 and 12 electrophoretic patterns by PFGE and REP-PCR, respectively. The degree of genetic variability indicated an endogenous origin of the nosocomial infections.
