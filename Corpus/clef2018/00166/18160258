Growth and metabolism of infants born to women infected with human immunodeficiency virus and fed acidified whey-adapted starter formulas. To compare the effects of a biologically and chemically acidified formula with or without probiotics with a standard formula on growth of infants negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).This was a double-masked, randomized, clinical trial. Infants born to consenting HIV-positive women who had decided not to breast-feed before being approached for participating in the study were randomized to receive one of four milk formulas: a chemically acidified formula with or without probiotics (Bifidobacterium lactis), a biologically acidified formula, or a standard whey formula. Infants who subsequently became HIV-positive according to polymerase chain reaction at 6 wk were excluded. Their growth and biochemical status were monitored for 4-6 mo. The z scores at the last visit of infants in each of the four formula groups were compared using analysis of covariance correcting for the z scores at baseline. Blood gases and pH were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance corrected for center.One hundred thirty-two HIV-negative infants were monitored for growth and biochemical parameters for 4-6 mo. There was an improvement of z scores for all formulas, and there were no differences in weight for age (P = 0.22), length for age (P = 0.56), head circumference for age (P = 0.66), or weight for length (P = 0.13). There were no differences in blood pH and biochemical parameters among the formula groups.The growth of infants fed one of the three acidified formulas was not inferior to the standard formula. Growth and metabolism in HIV-negative infants fed the acidified formulas were not affected by the method of milk acidification.
