Epidemiology, antibiotic consumption and molecular characterisation of Staphylococcus aureus infections--data from the Polish Neonatology Surveillance Network, 2009-2012. Our aim was to determine and characterize S. aureus (SA) isolated from infections in newborns for antibiotic resistance, virulence factors, genotypes, epidemiology and antibiotic consumption.Prospective surveillance of infections was conducted. Data about antibiotic treatment were analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed. PCR amplification was used to detect resistance and virulence genes. Typing methods such as PFGE, spa-typing and SCCmec were used.SA was found to be associated with 6.5% of infections. Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 32.8% of SA-infections. An incidence of MRSA-infections was 1.1/1000 newborns. MRSA-infections were diagnosed significantly earlier than MSSA-infections in these newborns (14th day vs. 23rd day (p=0.0194)). MRSA-infections increased the risk of newborn's death. Antibiotic consumption in both group was similar, but a high level of glycopeptides-usage for MSSA infections was observed. In the MRSA group, more strains were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and amikacin than in the MSSA group. Hla gene was present in 93.9% of strains, and seg and sei in 65.3% of strains, respectively. One dominant clone was found among the 14 MRSA isolates. Fifteen strains belonging to SCCmec type IV were spa-t015 and one strain belonging to SCCmec type V was spa-t011.Results obtained in the study point at specific epidemiological situation in Polish NICU (more detailed studies are recommended). High usage of glycopeptides in the MSSA infections treatment indicates the necessity of antimicrobial stewardship improvement and introducing molecular screening for early identification of infections.
