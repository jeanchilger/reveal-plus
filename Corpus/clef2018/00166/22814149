Detection and serotyping of human adenoviruses from patients with influenza-like illness in mongolia. Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are responsible for approximately 5%-10% of acute  respiratory infections. The serotypes of commonly detected respiratory HAdV in Asian countries are  diverse. However, there are no well-documented reports of circulating HAdV serotypes in Mongolia.  Between January 2010 and May 2011, 1,950 influenza-negative samples from patients with influenza-like  illness, including eye swabs from patients with eye symptoms, were screened for HAdV, and 40  samples (2.1%) were positive for HAdVs. Among these 40 samples, 31 samples were positive for the hexon  gene used in phylogenetic analysis, as determined by PCR. We identified 7 different serotypes. We  constructed the phylogenetic trees of HAdV-B7 and HAdV-B3, the 2 most commonly detected serotypes in  this study. All detected HAdV-B7 and -B3 Mongolian strains had identical sequences. HAdV-D8, known to  be associated with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), was detected from nasopharyngeal and eye  swabs. There was no difference between the amino acid sequences of the hexon and fiber genes that may affect  tissue tropism in Mongolian strains and those in EKC-causing strains.
