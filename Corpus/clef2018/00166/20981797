Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: are viruses involved? Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is characterized by abnormal thickening of the internal circular muscle layer. IHPS is known to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but its precise causes and pathophysiology are poorly understood. The objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of the principal viruses targeting the respiratory and digestive tracts in children with IHPS. Nasopharyngeal fluids, stools, vomit, and surgical pyloric muscle fragments and swabs were tested by cell culture, viral antigen assay and PCR. IHPS was diagnosed in 23 boys and 8 girls with a mean (± SD) age of 42 ± 15 days (range 20-88 days). There was no seasonal pattern of diagnosis. Twenty-two children (71%) lost weight (mean 246 ± 164 g, range 30-600 g) after the onset of vomiting, and five (16.1%) were dehydrated. Seven (22.6%) infants had been exposed to an infectious contact within 15 days before admission, and one on the day of admission (3.2%). Ear, nose and throat samples and pyloric muscle specimens were negative for all the viruses tested. An adenovirus type 3 was recovered from one stool sample, and RT-PCR was positive for an enterovirus on one vomit sample. This study suggests that the principal viruses targeting the respiratory and digestive tracts are not responsible for IHPS.
