Temporal and spatial distribution of clonal complexes of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics in Belgium, 1997 to 2004. We performed multilocus sequence typing on 203 invasive disease isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to assess the clonal compositions of isolates from two provinces in Belgium and to determine the relationship between clones and antibiotic nonsusceptibility, particularly nonsusceptibility to two or more classes of antibiotics. The frequency of multiclass nonsusceptibility (MCNS) was higher in the province of West Flanders (38%) than in Limburg (21%). This difference was largely attributable to five clonal complexes (CC156, CC81, CC143, CC193, and CC1848), which contained high proportions of isolates with MCNS (>47%) and which were circulating at higher frequencies in West Flanders. The S. pneumoniae population changed over time, as CC156 and CC81 declined in frequency from 1997 to 1999 to 2001 to 2004. Over the same time period, the frequency of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7 (PCV7) serotypes dropped from 69% to 41%. In contrast, the nonvaccine serotype 19A increased in frequency from 2.1% to 6.6%. None of these changes can be attributed to PCV7 vaccine, as it was not in use in Belgium during the time period studied. There was evidence that MCNS clones flowed from West Flanders to Limburg.
