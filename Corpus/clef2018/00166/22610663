Identification of group A streptococcal emm types commonly associated with invasive infections and antimicrobial resistance by the use of multiplex PCR and high-resolution melting analysis. M/emm typing, based either on serotyping of the M protein or on sequencing of the emm gene, is a major tool for epidemiological studies of group A streptococci (GAS). In order to simplify M/emm typing, we designed two multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) formats capable of identifying the most frequent GAS M/emm types involved in invasive infections and antimicrobial resistance. A heptaplex PCR procedure was first developed in a conventional format coupled with gel electrophoresis to identify emm types 1, 3, 4, 6, 12, 28, and 89, based on the size of the amplification products. The other method, designed to identify the same seven emm types, together with emm11, was based on a real-time PCR format coupled with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, allowing the rapid typing of large strain collections.
