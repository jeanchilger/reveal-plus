Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Salmonella enterica serovar Oranienburg (CTX-M-2 group) in a pediatric hospital in Tucumán, Argentina. Salmonella sp infections have been reported over recent years in hospitals in Argentina and other countries due to multiresistant strains. The aim of this study was to characterize the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in third-generation cephalosporin-resistant strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Oranienburg.We studied 60 strains isolated from children with gastroenteritis and/or extraintestinal complications. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the isolates were analyzed and the beta-lactamases were characterized using phenotyping and genotyping methods.All the strains were resistant to ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefepime and aztreonam and partially susceptible to ceftazidime, thus corresponding well with the resistance phenotype conferred by CTX-M-type beta-lactamases. An isoelectric point enzyme (pI = 7.9) was detected in all of the strains, and this was confirmed by PCR as a member of the CTX-M-2 group.This is the first report of Salmonella enterica serovar Oranienburg producing beta-lactamases of the CTX-M-2 group in a pediatric hospital in Tucumán, Argentina.
