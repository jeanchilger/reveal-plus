(18)FDG PET/CT imaging in primary breast lymphoma and breast cancer. Of women between 15 and 29 years of age, 13.6% will die from breast cancer. For women between 30 and 64 years of age, 19% will die from breast cancer.We studied 1728 oncological patients and 295 patients were included, 293 with breast cancer (17%) and two patients with primary breast lymphoma (0.1%).There were 98% females and 2% males. SUVmax for the primary tumor was 4.2 +/- 2.6 SD. Mean SUVmax for patients with primary breast lymphoma were 3.2 and 1.4. Sites of metastases were lymph nodes in the neck (4.4% SUVmax 2.7), internal mammary lymph nodes (5% SUVmax 5.3), mediastinum (8.3% SUVmax 5.0), retroperitoneal (6 % SUVmax 5.4), ipsilateral axilla (94% SUVmax 4.5), contralateral axilla (4.4% SUVmax 2.8), pectoral muscle (10.2% SUVmax 2.6), pleura (4.4% SUVmax 3.9), lung (32.3% SUVmax 2.9), liver (19.1% SUVmax 4.5), bone (36.7%), adrenal gland (4.4% SUVmax 2.4), brain (4.4%), spleen and contralateral breast, one case each. One patient presented thymic hyperplasia after chemotherapy. Mean SUVmax for blastic lesions was 5.4 +/- 2.9 SD, for lytic lesions it was 6.7 +/- 2.4 SD and for lesions not apparent on the CT it was 4.6 +/- 2.4 SD. The incidence of a second primary was 4.7%, 2.1% ovarian, 1.4% lung, 0.3% lymphoma, 0.3% endometrium, 0.3% pancreas and 0.3% thyroid.Mean SUVmax for the primary tumor was similar to that reported in the literature. Values for metastatic bone lesions are higher in this study. Inclusion of PET/CT in the followup of breast lesions is cost efficient.
