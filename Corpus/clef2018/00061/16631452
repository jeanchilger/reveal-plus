The evolution of imaging in advanced prostate cancer. Medical advances will be driven by the enhancement of imaging for diagnosis, refinement of treatment, and evaluation of treatment efficacy. The convergence of technology in materials science, biology, and the computer industry has greatly advanced diagnostic imaging. Precision in control of the spatial and temporal properties of light and its heterogeneous scattering properties have extended our capability for imaging. Refinements in radioimmunoscintigraphy for image acquisition, fusion of images, and outcome data now suggest use for image-guided therapy. Novel MRI agents appear to provide significant imaging capabilities to detect malignant lymph nodes. Future applications of optical coherence tomography, electron paramagnetic resonance imaging, nanotechnology, molecular imaging, and hyperspectral spectroscopy promise further refinements to image tissues for diagnosis.
