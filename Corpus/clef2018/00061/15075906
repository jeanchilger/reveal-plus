Screening for lung cancer. With the development of newer forms of technology such as low-dose spiral computed tomography, there has been a resurgent interest in screening for lung cancer. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in screening for lung cancer. Articles published since September 2002 are reviewed here.More frequent screenings (every 4 or 6 months) showed increased mortality from lung cancer, compared with annual screening. A mass screening conducted in 1990 was effective in a case-control study. The results of lung cancer screening by low-dose spiral computed tomography were reported from the Milan group and the Mayo Clinic. Computed tomography depicted peripheral early lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma. These results are consistent with previous reports from other groups. Screening with imaging becomes more sensitive with automated computerized methods.A high percentage of stage IA lung cancers were detected by screening with low-dose helical computed tomography. The characteristics of the nodules detected by low-dose spiral computed tomography have been clarified. There have been many controversial discussions about cost effectiveness and overdiagnosis. There is still no evidence that screening tests reduce the rate of cancer-specific mortality. Several studies of screening for lung cancer are under way.
