A mutation in cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 restores respiration of the mutant pet ts1402. The yeast PET1402/OXA1 gene encoding a 44.8-kDa protein is required for mitochondrial biogenesis. Substitution of Leu240 to serine in the protein results in an accumulation of the precursor form of the mitochondrially encoded subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase (Cox2) and temperature-sensitive respiration. This temperature sensitivity can be suppressed by a mutation in the cox2 gene changing Ala189 of the Cox2 protein to proline. In the cox2-ts1402 double mutant respiration is restored without removal of the Cox2 pre-sequence. The suppression suggests an interaction of the Pet1402 protein with the cytochrome oxidase complex. Antibodies raised against the predicted C-terminus and the tagged N-terminus of the Pet1402 protein reacted with a 37-kDa polypeptide. This protein, present in the mitochondrial fraction, is localized within the inner membrane. The difference in size can be explained by the removal of the predicted mitochondrial-targeting sequence from the Pet1402 protein. The mitochondrial localization of the protein points to a direct interaction with the cytochrome oxidase complex.
