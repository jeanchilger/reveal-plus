Positron emission tomography imaging in nonsmall-cell lung cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-2-deoxy-D-glucose, a D-glucose analog labeled with fluorine-18, complements conventional radiologic assessment in the evaluation of patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PET is being routinely used to improve the detection of nodal and extrathoracic metastases. PET is also currently being evaluated in the assessment of prognosis and therapeutic response and by potentially allowing an earlier assessment of response may prove invaluable in the oncologic management of patients. The article discusses the diagnosis, staging, and assessment of treatment response and prognosis with an emphasis on the appropriate clinical use of PET in management.
