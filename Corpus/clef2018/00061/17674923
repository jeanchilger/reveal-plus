Value of positron emission tomography in staging ocular adnexal lymphomas and evaluating their response to therapy. An observational case series to assess the value of positron emission tomography (PET) in staging ocular adnexal lymphomas and evaluating their response to therapy.The clinical records of 16 consecutive patients with ocular adnexal lymphoma for whom pretreatment and posttreatment PET scans and corresponding computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were available were compared.Pretreatment PET scans demonstrated fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positive lesions in 15 orbits of 12 patients. In 1 patient with low-grade follicular lymphoma of the orbit, PET revealed an additional focus of lymphoma in the deltoid muscle that was missed on clinical examination and conventional radiography. All of the posttreatment PET scans showed complete resolution of FDG uptake, suggesting good response to therapy. However, posttreatment CT and MRI scans demonstrated residual masses in 3 patients.PET is valuable for initial staging of ocular adnexal lymphomas and may be a good adjunct to conventional imaging in evaluation of response to therapy.
