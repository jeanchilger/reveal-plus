The usefulness of subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI in single- and dual-headed SPECT cameras in partial epilepsy. To prove the clinical usefulness of SISCOM and compare SISCOM images derived from single- and dual-headed single-photon computed tomography (SPECT) cameras for localization of partial epileptic seizures.We retrospectively studied 38 partial epilepsy patients, using subtraction SPECT coregistered to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI SISCOM). SPECT imaging of the first 15 patients was performed by single-headed camera, and the next 23 patients by dual-headed camera. Side-by-side ictal-interictal SPECT evaluation and SISCOM images were blindly reviewed and classified as either localizing to one of 16 sites or nonlocalizing. A third reviewer evaluated cases of disagreement between primary reviewers. Results were compared with seizure localization by any of the following three traditional techniques: surgical outcome, invasive, and noninvasive video-EEG monitoring. The results from the single- and dual-headed SPECT cameras were compared.Reviewers localized areas of hyperperfusion with SISCOM images more often than with side-by-side SPECT evaluation (71.0 vs. 47.4% p = 0.01). When we compared results of SPECT evaluation with traditional techniques, SISCOM showed greater concordance than side-by-side SPECT evaluation (60.53 vs. 36.84%SISCOM is a worthwhile technique for preoperative evaluation in partial epilepsy patients and improves the sensitivity and specificity of seizure localization of SPECT images derived from both single- and dual-headed SPECT cameras.
