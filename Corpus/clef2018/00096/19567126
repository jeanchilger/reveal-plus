Growing characteristic of breast adenocarcinoma suicide gene cell line T47D-tk and construction of subcutaneous xenografts. To further identify the breast adenocarcinoma cell line T47D-tk stably expressing the suicide gene HSV1-tk, observe its growing characteristics, and establish an animal model of implanted breast adenocarcinoma.Retroviral vector of HSV1-tk gene and breast carcinoma cell line T47D-tk stably expressing the HSV1-tk gene were established. Breast carcinoma cells of the lines T47D and T47D-tk were cultured, and observed by inverted microscope. Growth curve was drawn. Genomic DNA of T47D-tk cells was extracted, and amplified by PCR with HSV1-tk and HSV1-tk P2 as primers. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to identify the HSV1tk gene. Suspensions of T47D and T47D-tk cells were inoculated subcutaneously at bilateral roots of foreleg of female BALB/c nude mice respectively. The growth of tumor was observed every day.PCR showed 1131 bp fragment in the T47D-tk genome, but not in the T47D genome. The numbers of growing T47D cells on days 3, and 7 were (10.00 +/- 1.30) x 10(3) and (19.25 +/- 0.66) x 10(3) respectively, not significantly different from those of the T47D-tk cells [(10.25 +/- 0.90) x 10(3) and (19.00 +/- 1.80) x 10(3) respectively, both P > 0.05]. The time needed for tumor formation after the inoculation of T47D cells was (9.67 +/- 0.33) d, not significantly different from that of the T47D-tk cells [(9.83 +/- 0.48) d, P > 0.05]. The tumor size 19 days after inoculation of the T47D cells was (72.17 +/- 25.88) mm(3), not significantly different from that of the T47D-tk cells [(70.66 +/- 22.16) mm(3), P > 0.05].The T47D-tk cells have integrated the HSV1-tk gene without changing its growing characteristics. An animal model of implanted breast cancer has been successfully established. The T47D and T47D-tk subcutaneous xenografts offer the foundation for further study of gene imaging and gene therapy.
