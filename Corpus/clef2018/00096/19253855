SPECT/CT fusion imaging for the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions in bones. The aim of the study was to evaluate the value of the single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) fusion imaging in the diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions in bones.One hundred and forty one bone lesions of 125 cancer patients, for whom the natures of the lesions were not able to be determined by the 99Tc(m)-MDP whole-body bone scan, were examined by the SPECT, CT and SPECT/CT fusion imaging simultaneously. All of the images were blindly interpreted independently by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. The natures of the lesions were eventually confirmed by MRI, pathology or follow-up diagnosis six months later.The diagnostic sensitivity of SPECT, SPECT+CT and SPECT/CT for the 141 bone lesions was 82.5%, 93.7%, and 98.4% respectively. The specificity was 66.7%, 80.8%, and 93.6% respectively. The accuracy was 73.8%, 86.5%, and 95.7% respectively. The specificity and accuracy of SPECT/CT for diagnosing bone lesions were significantly higher than those of SPECT and SPECT+CT (P<0.05).SPECT/CT can effectively differentiate benign and malignant bone lesions.
