Imaging in epilepsy: functional studies. Neuroimaging studies play a fundamental role in the diagnosis and evaluation of epilepsy. Technological advances in neuroimaging techniques have made it possible to obtain functional as well as structural information. The pathophysiology of epilepsy consists of an abnormal increase in cerebral activity that can be appreciated on neuroimaging techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), PET, and SPECT. In patients with epilepsy that is refractory to drug therapy, the main aim of surgery is to control seizures and thus to improve the quality of life. In the preoperative workup of these patients, fMRI has an increasingly important role, evaluating the location of functional areas that must be safeguarded during surgery.
