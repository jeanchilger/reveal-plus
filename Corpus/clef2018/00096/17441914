Update on radiological imaging of renal cell carcinoma. US is frequently used as the initial imaging in patients with suspected renal disease. US contrast agents offer the potential to increase the sensitivity in patients who cannot undergo CT or MTI. Harmonic imaging has helped with the evaluation of renal cystic lesions. CT remains the reference standard for staging and lesion characterization. The rapid technological advances mean that ultra-thin slices and 3D imaging have now become more widely available. MRI has also greatly advanced in speed and image quality, but at present, imaging time and scanner availability mean that MRI is generally used as a problem-solving tool. It is particularly helpful for smaller lesions and complex cystic lesions, where subtraction can be used to accurately identify the presence of enhancement. MRI is used as the primary diagnostic tool for patients with radiation concerns and those with renal failure. Caution must now also be taken in these patients, given the recent studies raising the association of gadolinium-based compounds and NSF. There have been dramatic improvements in renal imaging over the last decade, offering better resolution, shorter imaging times and better patient acceptance. The progress in minimally invasive techniques has driven the need to provide better preoperative information to the surgeon. The future of renal imaging is an exciting field perhaps with fluorodeoxyglucose-based positron emission tomography we will be able to predict the biological behaviour of a tumour, and molecular imaging agents will become available to identify and hopefully treat specific tumour types.
