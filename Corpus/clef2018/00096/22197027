(18)FDG-PET/CT for detection of mediastinal nodal metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucos -e positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) in detecting mediastinal nodal metastasis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Studies about (18)FDG-PET/CT for detecting mediastinal nodal metastasis in patient with NSCLC were systematically searched in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Review databases from January 1, 2000 to July 26, 2011. A software called "Meta-Disc" was used to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR), respectively. We also calculated summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves, and the Q* index.20 articles fulﬁlled all inclusion criteria (3028 eligible patients). The pooled sensitivity, and speciﬁcity with 95% confidence interval for PET/CT on a per-patient analysis were 0.719 (0.683-0.753), and 0.898 (0.882-0.912). Corresponding values for PET/CT on a per-nodal-station analysis were 0.610 (0.582-0.636), 0.924 (0.918-0.930). The Q* index estimates under SROC were 0.8464 and 0.8067, respectively.(18)FDG-PET/CT had more specificity but less sensitivity for mediastinal nodal metastasis in patients with NSCLC.
