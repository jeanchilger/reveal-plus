Nanobodies targeting the hepatocyte growth factor: potential new drugs for molecular cancer therapy. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met are associated with increased aggressiveness of tumors and poor prognostic outcome of patients with cancer. Here, we report the development and characterization of therapeutic anti-HGF (αHGF)-Nanobodies and their potential for positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging to assess HGF expression in vivo. Two αHGF-Nanobodies designated 1E2 and 6E10 were identified, characterized, and molecularly fused to an albumin-binding Nanobody unit (Alb8) to obtain serum half-life extension. The resulting Nanobody formats were radiolabeled with the positron emitter zirconium-89 ((89)Zr, t(1/2) = 78 hours), administered to nude mice bearing U87 MG glioblastoma xenografts, and their biodistribution was assessed. In addition, their therapeutic effect was evaluated in the same animal model at doses of 10, 30, or 100 μg per mouse. The (89)Zr-Nanobodies showed similar biodistribution with selective tumor targeting. For example, 1E2-Alb8 showed decreased blood levels of 12.6%ID/g ± 0.6%ID/g, 7.2%ID/g ± 1.0%ID/g, 3.4%ID/g ± 0.3%ID/g, and 0.3%ID/g ± 0.1%ID/g at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after injection, whereas tumor uptake levels remained relatively stable at these time points: 7.8%ID/g ± 1.1%ID/g, 8.9%ID/g ± 1.0%ID/g, 8.7%ID/g ± 1.5%ID/g, and 7.2%ID/g ±1.6%ID/g. Uptake in normal tissues was lower than in tumor, except for kidneys. In a therapy study, all Nanobody-treated mice showed tumor growth delay compared with the control saline group. In the 100-μg group, four of six mice were cured after treatment with 1E2-Alb8 and 73 days follow-up, and three of six mice when treated with 6E10-Alb8. These results provide evidence that Nanobodies 1E2-Alb8 and 6E10-Alb8 have potential for therapy and PET imaging of HGF-expressing tumors.
