 The CD105 antigen (endoglin) is a hypoxia-inducible, 180-kDa, disulfide-linked, homodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein that is a co-receptor for the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (1). Both CD105 and TGF-β are expressed at low levels in resting endothelial cells, but they are overexpressed in cancerous lesions and play a significantly proangiogenic role in remodeling the vasculature of malignant tumors (2). It has been shown that the levels of CD105 in endothelial tissues correlate well with the degree of cell proliferation and that the antigen is a suitable biomarker to quantify tumor angiogenesis and can be used to determine the prognostic outcome for cancer patients (3). The biological activity of CD105 has been discussed in detail by Seon et al. (4). Investigators have demonstrated that immunotoxins and radioimmunoconjugates generated with anti-CD105 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can inhibit angiogenesis and prevent the growth and metastasis of cancerous tumors (4). For translation to the clinic, a human/mouse chimeric anti-CD105 mAb (designated c-SNj6 or TRC105) was generated, and shown to have suitable pharmacokinetic, toxicological, and immunogenicity characteristics for use in non-human primates (5). Currently, a clinical trial is in progress to evaluate the use of TRC105 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. TRC105 has been labeled with
