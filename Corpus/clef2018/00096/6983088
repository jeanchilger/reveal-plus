Comparison of N-isopropyl (I-123) p-iodoamphetamine brain scans using Anger camera scintigraphy and single-photon emission tomography. N-isopropyl (I-123) p-iodoamphetamine (IMP), which is extracted by the brain in proportion to regional blood flow, has been shown to be useful with single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) in the assessment of pathologic states related to blood flow. Because emission tomographic equipment is not yet available at most hospitals, the authors compared IMP brain images obtained with an Anger camera with those obtained by SPECT to determine the usefulness of IMP scintigraphy. Thirty-nine pairs of studies were performed on 12 control patients, 14 patients with stroke, three patients with tumors, and a miscellaneous group of eight patients. Planar scintigraphy showed good correlation with SPECT in determining the presence or absence of abnormality in all patients except one with a very small brain stem infarction that was not detected by planar imaging. Anger images showed poor contrast resolution compared with SPECT images. It is thus expected that SPECT will result in better lesion detection when smaller lesions are studied. Planar scintigraphy is not capable of providing quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow.
