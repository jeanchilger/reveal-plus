Oxygen extraction fraction at maximally vasodilated tissue in the ischemic brain estimated from the regional CO2 responsiveness measured by positron emission tomography. The oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) at maximally vasodilated tissue in patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease was evaluated using positron emission tomography. The vascular responsiveness to changes in PaCO2 was measured by the H2(15)O autoradiographic method. It was correlated with the resting-state OEF, as estimated using the 15O steady-state method. The subjects comprised 15 patients with unilateral or bilateral occlusion and stenosis of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery or moyamoya disease. In hypercapnia, the scattergram between the OEF and the vascular/responsiveness to changes in PaCO2 revealed a significant negative correlation in 11 of 19 studies on these patients, and the OEF at the zero cross point of the regression line with a vascular responsiveness of 0 was 0.53 +/- 0.08 (n = 11). This OEF in the resting state corresponds to exhaustion of the capacity for vasodilation. The vasodilatory capacity is discussed in relation to the lower limit of autoregulation.
