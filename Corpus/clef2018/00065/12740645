Usefulness of technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile liver single photon emission computed tomography to detect hepatocellular carcinoma. Technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (Tc-99m MIBI) has been shown to be useful in identifying several types of tumors, such as breast, lung and thyroid cancers. The usefulness of Tc-99m MIBI liver imaging in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial. In this study, 22 patients with HCC performed Tc-99m MIBI liver single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Twenty of 22 patients (90.9%) showed negative liver SPECT findings without significant Tc-99m MIBI uptake in HCC, and only 2 patients (9.1%) showed positive liver SPECT findings with significant Tc-99m MIBI uptake in HCC. In addition, no significant correlation between liver SPECT findings with sex, age, alpha feto-protein serum level, HCC differentiation, and virus hepatitis status was found. We concluded that Tc-99m MIBI liver SPECT is not a sensitive tool to detect HCC.
