Study of clinical value of dual-phase imaging using single photon emission computed tomography with coincidence detection for differentiating benign from malignant lesions. To investigate the clinical value of dual-phase imaging of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) using single photon emission computed tomography with coincidence detection (SPECT with coincidence) for differentiating benign and malignant lesions.Thirty patients with unknown lesions from June 2003 to March 2004 in our hospital were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent dual-phase imaging of 18F-FDG SPECT with coincidence. The early images were obtained 60 min post injection. And the patients were divided into 2 groups, one receiving delayed scans at 210 min after 18F-FDG injection and the other at 270 min. Lesion status was determined by pathologic findings or by clinical follow-up.Forty-eight lesions (30 malignant and 18 benign lesions verified by pathologic findings or clinical follow-up) of 30 patients were detected by dual-phase imaging, in which there were 29 true positive results, 15 true negative, 3 false positive and 1 false negative. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of dual-phase imaging were 96.7%, 83.3%, 91.6%, 90.6%, and 93.8%, respectively. Those of early imaging and CT were 93.3%, 72.2%, 85.4%, 84.8%, 86.7% and 76.9%, 57.1%, 70.0%, 76.9%, 57.1%, respectively. The T/NT of all malignant lesions (except 1 false negative case) in delayed imaging were significantly increased (t=-3.071, P<0.01). However, there were no statistical differences in the T/NT of benign lesions (t=0.398, P=0.695) between early and delayed imagings.Dual-phase imaging of FDG SPECT with coincidence provides benefit for differentiating benign and malignant lesions.
