Clinical features of gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma: comparison with nodal follicular lymphoma and gastrointestinal MALT lymphoma. We retrospectively compared the clinicopathological features of primary intestinal follicular lymphomas (FL-GIs), nodal follicular lymphomas (FL-LNs) and gastrointestinal MALT lymphomas (MALT-GIs), and investigated the distribution and the endoscopic appearances of FL-GI to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment modality. The subjects were 28 FL-GI patients, 135 FL-LN patients and 70 MALT-GI patients. In FL-LNs the clinical stage III-IV was 83%, while in FL-GIs clinical stage I-II was 68%. In MALT-GIs clinical stage I-II was 87%. The overall survival was significantly better in MALT-GI patients than in FL-LN patients. All FL-GI patients were alive at the time of evaluation. Regarding the histological grade (WHO), grade 1 was 81% in FL-GI, whereas in FL-LN grade 2 was 28% and grade 3 was 11%. The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index was low in 61% of FL-GIs, while in FL-LNs it was equally distributed to low, intermediate and high, suggesting that the prognosis is better in FL-GIs than in FL-LNs. The clinicopathological studies revealed the FL-GI has intermediate characteristics between FL-LN and MALT-GI. We recommend a 'watch-and-wait' policy or chemotherapy with rituximab for the therapy of FL-GIs because the lesions are often located in broader areas from the lower duodenum to the small intestine.
