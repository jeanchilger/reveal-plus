Paraneoplastic syndromes of the peripheral nerves. To describe the paraneoplastic disorders of the motor and sensory nerves and neurons, and their immunologic associations.Recently proposed diagnostic criteria for paraneoplastic disorders may assist in determining the likelihood a given neuropathy or neuronopathy is related to an underlying malignancy. Of this group of disorders, paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathies are the most frequent many of these patients have anti-Hu antibodies and small-cell lung cancer. There is often motor, autonomic, or central nervous system involvement, and electrophysiological studies may demonstrate not only sensory changes, but also motor abnormalities. While cancer has been found more frequently than expected in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, this association is extremely rare. A limited number of reports have described chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, vasculitic neuropathies, and motor neuron disease as paraneoplastic disorders. Anti-CV2 antibodies are frequently associated with a paraneoplastic sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and small-cell lung cancer. Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability may occur with or without a cancer association, and in both instances patients often have antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channelsThere is increasing recognition of an extensive variety of paraneoplastic disorders of the peripheral nerves. In many of these disorders onconeuronal antibodies are absent. Whole body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning helps uncover the associated tumor, and recently proposed criteria may assist in the diagnosis. In many instances, prompt treatment of the tumor and immunotherapy result in symptom stabilization or neurologic improvement.
