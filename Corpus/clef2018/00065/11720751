Positron emission tomography (PET) of non-small cell lung cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) with FDG has shown to be of substantial value in differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions and in the assessment of lymph node involvement with higher sensitivity and specificity than CT. A negative PET scan of the mediastinum suggests that mediastinoscopy is unnecessary and that these patients can proceed directly to thoracotomy. The method is also useful for the visualization of distant metastases. Since changes of treatment may result after identification of distant metastases PET is also cost-effective [Eur J Nucl Med 27(2000)1598 Australas Radiol 45(2001)9]. Furthermore, changes of tumor metabolism can be detected with PET at early stages after treatment, which can be used for therapy monitoring and for the detection of recurrent tumor tissue after completion of treatment.
