Preoperative diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma with a novel monoclonal antibody. This study was undertaken to determine whether preoperative radioimmunoscintigraphy of complex ovarian masses with technetium Tc 99m MAb-170 (Tru-Scint AD Biomira Inc, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada), a murine whole immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody that has been found to have panadenocarcinoma affinity, would predict surgical findings.The age range of studied patients was 42 to 83 years (mean, 60.3 years). Planar computed tomographic imaging and single-photon emission computed tomographic imaging were performed at 15 minutes, 6 to 8 hours, and 18 to 24 hours after injection of 1000 MBq technetium Tc 99m MAb-170. Laparotomy was performed within 10 days.Eighteen patients had borderline or invasive ovarian cancers verified by histologic examination. All primary malignancies or deposits (including intrahepatic deposits) yielded positive results on radioimmunoscintigraphic imaging. Radioimmunoscintigraphy was able to identify serosal deposits not seen on computed tomographic or ultrasonographic scans. False-positive localization of the antibody was noted in 6 of the 9 patients with benign pathologic processes.It is possible to detect with technetium Tc 99m MAb-170 all patients who have cancer (including sites not seen on computed tomographic or ultrasonographic scan) however, the low specificity (33%) means that patients still require surgical verification of disease.
