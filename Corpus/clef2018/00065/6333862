Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale performance. Cortical localization by fluorodeoxyglucose F 18-positron emission tomography. We compared local cerebral glucose metabolism, as determined by positron emission tomography following administration of fluorodeoxyglucose F 18, with Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) scores in 22 right-handed persons. Five study subjects were normal volunteers and the remainder had Alzheimer's disease. Subtest scores within the verbal IQ group or the performance IQ group were generally highly interrelated there was usually no correlation between the verbal and performance subtests. The cortical distribution of regions in which glucose metabolism was most closely associated with verbal subtest scores generally centered in the left parasylvian area. In contrast, scores on the performance subtests mainly localized to the right posterior parietal region. Most WAIS subtests thus appeared to evaluate primarily either verbal or visuospatial cognitive functions and either left parasylvian or right posteroparietal cortical activity.
