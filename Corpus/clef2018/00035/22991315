Comparison of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and quantitative SPECT in a rat glioma model. Pharmacokinetic modeling of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data provides measures of the extracellular-extravascular volume fraction (v(e) ) and the volume transfer constant (K(trans) ) in a given tissue. These parameter estimates may be biased, however, by confounding issues such as contrast agent and tissue water dynamics, or assumptions of vascularization and perfusion made by the commonly used model. In contrast to MRI, radiotracer imaging with SPECT is insensitive to water dynamics. A quantitative dual-isotope SPECT technique was developed to obtain an estimate of v(e) in a rat glioma model for comparison with the corresponding estimates obtained using DCE-MRI with a vascular input function and reference region model. Both DCE-MRI methods produced consistently larger estimates of v(e) in comparison to the SPECT estimates, and several experimental sources were postulated to contribute to these differences.
