Transcranial Doppler sonography in cerebrovascular diseases. A review of our 1 1/2 years' experience with transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) is given. In total, 619 TCD examinations were performed. Considering physiological variations of blood flow velocities in the intracranial arteries, TCD findings in stenoses and occlusions of the extracranial and intracranial brain-supplying arteries as well as in intracranial vasospasms were evaluated. In patients with leptomeningeal anastomoses demonstrated by TCD in the region of the peripheral middle cerebral artery, the regional cerebral blood flow was measured by 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT. The value and limitations of TCD in cerebrovascular diseases and the indications to TCD examination of the intracranial arteries are discussed.
