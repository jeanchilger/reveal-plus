Altered serotonin 2A receptor activity in women who have recovered from bulimia nervosa. The authors' goal was to confirm that brain serotonin (5-HT) alterations are present in patients who have recovered from bulimia nervosa. Positron emission tomography imaging with [(18)F]altanserin was used to characterize binding of the 5-HT(2A) receptor, which might contribute to altered feeding, mood, or impulse control.Nine women who had recovered from bulimia nervosa (they had no episodes of binge eating or purging, were at normal weight, and had regular menstrual cycles for more than 1 year) were compared with 12 female volunteers who had never had bulimia.The healthy volunteers, but not the women who had recovered from bulimia nervosa, had an age-related decline in 5-HT(2A) binding. Women who had recovered from bulimia nervosa had a reduction of medial orbital frontal cortex 5-HT(2A) binding.The lack of age-related changes in 5-HT activity is further evidence of 5-HT alterations in subjects who have recovered from bulimia nervosa. In addition, vulnerabilities for eating disorders, impulse dyscontrol, and mood disturbances may involve 5-HT and frontal lobe activity.
