Effect of central cholinergic stimulation on regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer disease. Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) had reduced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the posterior parietotemporal region compared with controls, as determined with technetium-99m hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime and single photon emission tomography. Central cholinergic stimulation with physostigmine produced a focal increase in rCBF in the posterior parietotemporal region in the patients with AD but not in controls.
