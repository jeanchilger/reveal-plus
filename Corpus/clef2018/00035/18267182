Imaging evaluation of the solitary pulmonary nodule. The solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is a common diagnostic problem facing the pulmonologist. The incidence of SPNs is increasing primarily because of the increasing use of multidetector CT scanning for the evaluation of chest disease. This article reviews the radiologic assessment of the SPN, with a focus on thin-section CT, positron emission tomography, and CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy in the characterization of SPNs. The incorporation of clinical factors, local practice patterns and expertise, and access to technology will guide the diagnostic evaluation in a given patient. An evidence-based diagnostic algortihm for SPN evaluation will be proposed.
