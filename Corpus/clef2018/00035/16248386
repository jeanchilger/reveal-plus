Contribution of whole body FDG-PET to the detection of distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Accurate baseline staging is necessary to appropriately treat pancreatic cancer. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical contribution of whole body FDG-PET to the detection of distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer.A total of consecutive 42 patients with previously untreated pancreatic cancer were examined. Whole body FDG-PET imaging for initial staging was performed with a 3D acquisition and iterative reconstruction on Siemens ECAT HR+ scanner at 1 hour post 185-200 MBq 18F-FDG injection. PET findings were correlated with clinical and radiological data to determine the impact of PET on staging.In 16 patients, there were one or more sites of metastasis based on clinical data. FDG-PET correctly identified the presence of metastasis in 13 of 16 patients and its absence in 23 of the remaining 26 patients. Thus, FDG-PET missed 4 metastatic sites in 4 patients (liver and lung metastasis). FDG-PET correctly identified 8 metastatic sites in 7 patients (peritoneal dissemination and liver, bone and supraclavicular lymph node metastasis), which were missed on CT imaging. Based on whole body FDG-PET, the clinical stage was changed in 5 of 42 patients (11.9%).These results suggest that FDG-PET and CT appear to have a complementary role in the detection of distant metastasis in patients with pancreatic cancer.
