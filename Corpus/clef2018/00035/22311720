Measuring myocardial salvage. The efficacy of cardioprotective strategies can be quantified by myocardial salvage as an indicator of therapeutic benefit. Salvage is calculated as the difference between the area at risk (AAR) and the final infarct size (FIS). AAR has been quantified by angiographic assessment followed by quantification of FIS by biochemical ischaemic markers or imaging modalities such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Angiographical methods may overestimate AAR and since methodological differences may exist between different modalities, the use of different modalities for estimating AAR and FIS may not be recommended. (99m)Technetium (Tc)-Sestamibi single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) allows quantification of AAR and FIS by tracer injection prior to revascularization and after 1 month, respectively. SPECT provides the most validated measure of myocardial salvage and has been utilized in multiple randomized clinical trials. However, SPECT is logistically challenging, expensive, and includes radiation exposure. More recently, a large number of studies have suggested that CMR can determine salvage in a single examination by combining measures of myocardial oedema in the AAR exposed to ischaemia reperfusion with FIS quantification by late gadolinium enhancement. The T1- and T2-weighted CMR approaches for quantification of AAR utilize non-contrast, early and late gadolinium enhancement techniques. The technical progress, high spatial resolution and the potential for retrospective quantification of the AAR makes CMR the most appropriate technique for assessment of myocardial salvage. However, the optimum CMR technique for assessment of myocardial AAR remains to be defined. Consequently, we recommend a comprehensive CMR protocol to ensure reliable assessment of myocardial salvage.
