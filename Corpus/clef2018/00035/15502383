Diagnostic use of T2-weighted inversion-recovery magnetic resonance imaging in acute coronary syndromes compared with 99mTc-Pyrophosphate, 123I-BMIPP and 201TlCl single photon emission computed tomography. The incidence of missed diagnoses of acute cardiac ischemia in the emergency department could be reduced by a new imaging modality. In the present study, the clinical significance of (99m)Tc-pyrophosphate (PYP), (123)I-beta-methyl-p-iodephenyl-pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP), (201)TlCl scintigraphy (imaging) and T2-weighted inversion-recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of culprit lesion in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) was compared.The study group comprised 18 patients with ACS: 12 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (11 males mean age, 63+/-11 years) and 6 patients with unstable angina (UA) (3 males, mean age, 67+/-5 years). Of the 12 patients with AMI, 10 underwent (201)TlCl and PYP single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies as a dual-energy acquisition ((201)TlCl/PYP) and 8 underwent (201)TlCl SPECT within 1 week of the BMIPP study. All 18 patients underwent BMIPP SPECT and MRI. The MRI pulse sequence was black blood turbo short-inversion-time inversion recovery (STIR) (breath-hold T2-weighted studies). The T2-weighted inversion-recovery MRI showed higher sensitivity and negative predictive value than PYP and (201)TlCl, and higher specificity and positive predictive value than BMIPP and (201)TlCl. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for PYP, BMIPP, (201)TlCl and MRI was 0.787, 0.725, 0.731 and 0.878, respectively. The difference between the areas of MRI and BMIPP was significant (p<0.05).Accurate detection of culprit lesion is improved by using MRI rather than BMIPP, particularly for patients with ACS.
