Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: an emerging pathogen of pets in Egypt with a public health burden. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged to be a pathogen of public health burden causing infections with significant concern. This study was conducted to investigate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in pet dogs and cats as an emerging zoonosis that could be disseminated in the community. A total of 184 (nasal, oral, ear and wound) swabs were collected from 70 pet dogs and 48 pet cats, whereas 50 nasal and oral swabs were collected from 28 apparently healthy companion persons in intimate contact with pets and without history of hospitalization. All samples were cultured for the isolation and identification of Staphylococcus aureus using selective media, biochemical and serological tests, while isolates were identified as MRSA after antimicrobial susceptibility testing and determination of the MIC. PCR was applied using specific primers to confirm MRSA. Three MRSA isolates have been recovered from two dogs of 70 (2.9%) and one isolate from 28 examined persons (3.6%), while none of the examined cats yielded MRSA. Furthermore, we found that two MRSA isolates recovered from one diseased dog seemed to be hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA), whereas the other dog isolate as well as the human isolate were considered as community-acquired (CA-MRSA). The occurrence of MRSA in apparently healthy and/or diseased pet dogs makes it an emerging veterinary pathogen which could be considered a public health burden if it is disseminated in our community outside hospitals.
