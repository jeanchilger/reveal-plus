4-[ Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, vascular disorders, atherosclerosis, and chronic hepatitis, as well as in the biology of normal cells, such as epithelial cells and immune cells (1). During apoptosis, there is rapid redistribution of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner membrane leaflet to the outer membrane leaflet, exposing the anionic head group of PS. PS is also accessible for annexin V (or annexin A5) binding in necrosis because of disruption of the plasma membrane. Annexin V, a 36-kDa protein, binds to PS with high affinity (
