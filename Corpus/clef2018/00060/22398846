FDG-PET/CT-based gross tumor volume contouring for radiation therapy planning: an experimental phantom study. As there is continuing controversy over the role of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT-fused imaging in radiation therapy (RT) planning, we performed a phantom study to assess the feasibility of FDG-PET/CT-based gross tumor volume (GTV) contouring. The phantom set, consisting of an elliptical bowl and 6 spheres measuring from 10-37 mm in diameter, were filled with FDG to obtain 3 source-to-background ratios (SBRs) of 4, 8, and 16. The ratio to maximum intensity at 5% intervals was applied as the threshold for contouring. The ratio between contoured- and actual volumes (volume ratio) was calculated, and the threshold ratio was selected to provide a volume ratio close to 100%. To consider the clinical application, we applied the threshold value (maximum intensity × threshold ratio) for the largest 37-mm sphere to the 6 spheres. The threshold ratio and the volume ratio in 6 spheres with 3 SBRs were compared using the Friedman test. Threshold ratios ranged from 25-80% they were higher for smaller spheres (p = 0.003) and lower SBRs (p < 0.001). The volume ratios with the threshold value for the largest 37-mm sphere were lower in smaller spheres (p = 0.010). These results suggest that smaller lesions and higher background activities require a higher threshold ratio and smaller lesions a lower threshold value. FDG-PET/CT-fused imaging should not be used as a single modality but rather to obtain supplemental information in RT planning. The contoured GTV should be adjusted based on clinical data including conventional images.
