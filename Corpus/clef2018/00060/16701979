Brain perfusion and metabolism imaging techniques. Due to recent efforts in improving spatial and temporal resolution in imaging techniques, it is now possible to get relevant information about brain perfusion and metabolism in humans. This information can significantly impact on brain pathophysiology, diagnosis assessment and therapy options, particularly in patients having brain ischemia. Among these imaging and metabolism techniques are dynamic perfusion computed tomography, perfusion MRI, positron emission tomography and NMR spectroscopic imaging. The goal of this article is an overview of these four techniques, with their own technical description, advantages and drawbacks. Details are provided about brain parameters given by each technique and their clinical relevance, the accessibility of the technique in the emergency setting and the optimal window to use it during the patient's evolution.
