Myocardial perfusion defects in patients with autoimmune diseases: a prospective study. Analysis of two diagnostic tests. A significant correlation between autoimmune diseases and premature or accelerated coronary atherosclerosis has been found. The objectives of the study were: (a) to evaluate myocardial perfusion defects in patients with autoimmune diseases by contrast echocardiography and nuclear imaging and (b) to evaluate the prevalence of alterations in subclinical myocardial perfusion defects in autoimmune diseases. Myocardial perfusion in 37 patients was evaluated by contrast echocardiography at rest and with dobutamine and with nuclear imaging. The agreement between the two diagnostic tests at rest was 0.72 (P < 0.0001) and with dobutamine was 0.65 (P < 0.0001). The prevalence of abnormalities in myocardial perfusion in autoimmune diseases by contrast echocardiography and nuclear imaging was 27% and in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome was 30%. We concluded that there is a high level of agreement between contrast ecocardiography and nuclear imaging for assessment of myocardial perfusion defects in patients with autoimmune diseases, and their prevalence is similar to that reported in the literature.
