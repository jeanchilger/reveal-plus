Revised consensus 'Diagnosis of the dementia syndrome'. Dementia is a clinical syndrome and is diagnosed on clinical grounds. Various types can be distinguished: the Alzheimer-type, frontal lobe dementia and subcortical dementia syndromes. Neuropsychological examination can contribute to the clinical diagnosis. Differentiation from delirium and depression, which may co-exist with dementia, is necessary. Once a dementia syndrome has been diagnosed its cause has to be ascertained. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause and can often be diagnosed clinically. The clinical suspicion of vascular dementia has to be confirmed by imaging methods. Drug intoxication may cause or contribute to dementia. Blood tests should be performed routinely, but EEG, CT or MRI, SPECT and genetic tests can be carried out on clinical indication. Subsequently the need for care of the patient has to be established, as well as the ability of the carers to meet it. Regular follow-up is necessary. A definite diagnosis can only be made post-mortem when neuropathological examination has been performed. The organisation of diagnosis in the dementia syndrome should preferably take place in specialised multidisciplinary teams.
