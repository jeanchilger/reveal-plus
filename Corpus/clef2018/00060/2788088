A unified computer program for assessment of attenuation correction and data acquisition methods in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). A computer based simulation program was developed to assess the usefulness of various attenuation correction algorithms and data acquisition methods in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in a unified approach. The program analytically calculated projection ray sums from a mathematical model with various distributions of activities and either uniform or non uniform attenuation coefficients by using the line integrals including the effect of attenuation. Data acquisition starting at arbitrary angles, various acquisition angles, including a 180 degree scan and a non circular orbit of a gamma camera, including an elliptical orbit can readily be taken into consideration in our simulation program. To simulate non circular orbit data acquisition, the resolution dependence on the object distance from the collimator surface was incorporated into the simulation. This computer based simulation program allows various combinations of attenuation correction algorithms such as hybrid methods, and data acquisition methods can be evaluated under a large number of study conditions. The usefulness of this computer based simulation program is shown with several representative examples.
