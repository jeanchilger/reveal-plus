Cervical videomediastinoscopy. Cervical mediastinoscopy is a frequently used technique to assess the mediastinum, in particular the mediastinal lymph nodes in patients presenting with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The senior author of this article is credited for developing in 1989 the concept of what is now called videomediastinoscopy. The introduction of videomediastinoscopy has proven to be superior to conventional mediastinoscopy and has made teaching of this operation much easier. However, imaging modalities, in particular positron emission tomography, have substantially decreased the need for mediastinoscopy in early stage NSCLC, while in more advanced stages the indication for primary staging and/or restaging after induction therapy is now challenged by the increasing experience with endobronchial ultrasound, endoesophageal ultrasound, and fine-needle aspiration. This article discusses the current deployment of videomediastinoscopy in the diagnosis and management of NSCLC.
