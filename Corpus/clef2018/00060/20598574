Radioembolization with use of yttrium-90 resin microspheres in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein thrombosis. Intraarterial delivery of yttrium-90 ((90)Y)-bound microspheres (ie, radioembolization) is a promising treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An early concern was the "embolic" nature of the microspheres, and their potential to reduce hepatic arterial blood flow in patients with compromised portal blood flow secondary to portal vein thrombosis/occlusion (PVT). In this situation, the risk of liver failure could be enhanced, particularly in patients with cirrhosis who have increased hepatic arterial blood flow. This retrospective analysis was undertaken to assess the safety and clinical benefits of radioembolization with (90)Y resin microspheres in HCC with branch or main PVT.A total of 25 patients presenting with unresectable HCC and compromised portal flow received segmental, lobar, or whole-liver infusion of (90)Y resin microspheres. For the analysis of tumor response, changes in target lesions, appearance of new lesions, and changes in portal vein thrombus were studied. Controlled disease was defined by absence of progression in all these components.Globally, controlled disease was achieved in 66.7% of patients at 2 months and 50% of patients at 6 months. No significant changes were observed in liver-related toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0) at 1 and 2 months after treatment. Median survival time was 10 months (95% CI, 6.6-13.3 months).Radioembolization of unresectable HCC and branch or main PVT with (90)Y resin microspheres was associated with minimal toxicity and a favorable median survival time. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate the findings in this clinically challenging patient population.
