Assessment of gastric accommodation: overview and evaluation of current methods. Gastric accommodation is considered important in the pathophysiology of several upper gastrointestinal disorders including functional dyspepsia. The gold standard for its measurement is the barostat-balloon study which requires intubation. The aim was explore the reliability and performance characteristics of the techniques proposed for measurement of gastric accommodation. We undertook a literature search using MEDLINE with a broad range of key words. The accommodation reflex and its control are briefly described, based on human data. The performance characteristics of the intragastric barostat, transabdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, single photon emission computed tomography, and satiation drinking tests are described. For each technique, we summarize the following: principle, validation studies, advantages, disadvantages, and potential applications. Three-dimensional methods to measure gastric volume non-invasively are promising and among the best validated to date. Simpler techniques would be of considerable appeal for clinical and research studies, but further validation is necessary before satiation drinking tests can be used as surrogates for more sophisticated measurements of gastric accommodation.
