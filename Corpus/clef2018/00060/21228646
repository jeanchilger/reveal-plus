A critical review of neuroimaging applications in sports concussion. While abnormalities related to concussion are typically not identified on traditional clinical neuroimaging (i.e., computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), more sophisticated neuroimaging techniques have the potential to reveal the complex neurometabolic processes related to concussion and its recovery. Clinically, these techniques may one day provide useful information to guide clinicians in the management and treatment of sports concussion. This article critically reviews the current state of the literature regarding neuroimaging and sports concussion, identifies challenges in the application of these techniques, and identifies areas for future research.
