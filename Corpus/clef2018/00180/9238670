Identification of a Gly862 to Ser substitution in the type I collagen gene from a single spermatozoon. Individual spermatozoa from the father of two affected infants with osteogenesis imperfecta were separated by dilution and micromanipulation. A segment of the type I collagen gene containing the mutant region was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Among 40 individual spermatozoa, 15 specimens were identified as mutants with a substitution of guanine3208 to adenine (glycine862 to serine) while 18 and seven specimens were of the wild and mixed types respectively. Through this study, we have established a molecular procedure that can be considered as prerequisite for preimplantation diagnosis of genetic disorders with a single point mutation.
