Alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound scanning in the prenatal diagnosis of Turner's syndrome. Based on data from 5 cases of fetal cystic hygroma (4 cases of Turner's Syndrome and one case of Trisomy 18) and one case of Down's Syndrome with severe subcutaneous oedema, it is concluded that amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is normal or only slightly elevated in such cases whereas AFP in fluid from the cystic structures is very high. Reported high values of 'amniotic fluid' AFP are therefore likely to have been obtained from fluids accidentally drawn from the cystic structures. Fluids from the two sources cannot be distinguished from each other visually. In support of this theory is that the maternal serum AFP was found to be normal in all cases where investigated. In the diagnosis of cystic hygromata detailed ultrasound scanning will reveal the correct diagnosis.
