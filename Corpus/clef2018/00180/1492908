Detection of 47,XYY trophoblast fetal cells in maternal blood by fluorescence in situ hybridization after using immunomagnetic lymphocyte depletion and flow cytometry sorting. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) allows to diagnose aneuploidy in uncultured interphase nuclei. This rapid method of chromosomal analysis associated with cell-sorting techniques was realized on 47,XYY fetal cells isolated from maternal blood. Trophoblast cells were sorted by combining immunomagnetic removal of maternal lymphocytes and flow cytometry sorting using antitrophoblast monoclonal antibodies. Cells were sorted directly on slides and analyzed by FISH with a Y-centromeric probe. Among 1,387 examinable nuclei, 59 (4.25%) showed one single or two Y-specific domains.
