Prenatal diagnosis for the detection of Down syndrome: why are so few eligible women tested? Postpartum women greater than or equal to 33 years were interviewed about their attitudes to and knowledge and use of prenatal diagnosis. Overall, 68 per cent had heard of prenatal diagnosis: nevertheless, only 30 per cent of those greater than or equal to 35 had actually been tested. The only significant difference between eligible women who were tested and those who were not was maternal age. Of those tested, half requested it for themselves conversely, only two thirds of women requesting the procedure actually received it. Among women not tested, 82 per cent were never offered the procedure by the physician. Expressed attitudes to prenatal diagnosis were strongly positive among all women, with 75 per cent continuing to want testing after learning both their age-specific risk of having an affected child and the possible risks of amniocentesis. The data document a potential demand for amniocentesis far in excess of current use and present service facilities. They suggest, moreover, that underuse may reflect professional hesitation and underreferral more than consumer lack of demand or reluctance to be tested.
