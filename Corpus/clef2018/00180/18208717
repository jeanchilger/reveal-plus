Prenatal diagnostics in Arhus and Viborg Counties after implementation of first trimester risk assessment. In 2004 the Danish National Board of Health issued new guidelines for prenatal diagnostics in Denmark. The guidelines include a general offer to all pregnant women in Denmark of first trimester risk assessment of combined non-invasive tests integrating measurement of nuchal translucency and maternal biochemistry for detection of fetal chromosomal abnormalities like trisomy 21, and replacing the screening criteria of > or =35 of age.The study is based on registered data covering 5,504 pregnancies during the period 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2005 in Aarhus and Viborg Counties.77% of the pregnant women had a complete combined test and only 2% declined the program. At a cut off at 1:400 at term the detection rate for trisomy 21 was 85% (CI: 62.1-96.8%) with a false positive rate of 3.4%. There was a significant reduction in the number of prenatal karyotypes from 2002 to 2005 in both counties, with a 58% reduction in Viborg County and 33% in Aarhus County. The percentage of abnormal karyotypes over the same period increased from 2.8%% to 11.4% in Viborg County, and from 7.1% to 15.4% in Aarhus County.With a significant reduction in invasive procedures and a detection rate of 85% with a false positive rate of 3.4%, the results of the first trimester risk assessment program comply with the requirements defined by the Danish National Board of Health.
