Nonvisualization of the fetal gallbladder: frequency and prognostic importance. To assess the frequency of fetal gallbladder visualization through gestation and to determine the prognostic importance of nonvisualization.Demonstration of the gallbladder was prospectively attempted in 578 consecutive second- and third-trimester obstetric ultrasound examinations. Data regarding gallbladder visualization were stratified into subgroups on the basis of estimated gestational age. Postnatal follow-up was performed in 80 fetuses with nonvisualization of the gallbladder.The gallbladder was seen on 477 of 578 (82.5%) fetal sonograms. The likelihood of gallbladder visualization increased with advancing gestational age, reaching a plateau of approximately 95% between 24 and 32 weeks. After 32 weeks, the frequency of visualization declined. Seventy-five of the 80 fetuses with nonvisualized gallbladders who underwent follow-up had normal outcomes. Except for one fetus with trisomy 21, all fetuses with abnormalities had relatively minor, non-life threatening problems that did not involve the gallbladder or biliary tract.Most fetuses with nonvisualization of the gallbladder have normal outcomes. The rate of nonvisualization of the fetal gallbladder is sufficiently high to undermine the utility of gallbladder visualization as a screen for fetal abnormality.
