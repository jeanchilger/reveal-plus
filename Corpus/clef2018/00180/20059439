Outcomes for fetal echogenic bowel during the second trimester ultrasound. To investigate the association between fetal echogenic bowel (FEB) during the second trimester and perinatal outcome.A retrospective chart review of FEB during the second trimester over 3 years.A total of 56 women were identified of 9067 screened (0.6%) women. Forty-seven agreed to genetic counseling (84%). Of those, 22 (39%) agreed to an amniocentesis. There were three cases of trisomy 21, one case of trisomy 18 and one case of fetal CMV infection. Twelve fetuses had an adverse outcome (21%), with only three of them having an echogenic bowel as the only finding.In our study, almost 80% of the fetuses had an uncomplicated perinatal outcome. FEB was present as the only finding in only 5% of the fetuses with an adverse outcome. A potential association with placental abnormalities and a low prevalence of viral infections was observed. These findings may be of use in counseling parents.
