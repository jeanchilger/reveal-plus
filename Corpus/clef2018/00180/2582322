Genetic amniocentesis: significance of intraamniotic bleeding and placental location. Simultaneous ultrasound was used to determine if there was a correlation between visualized intraamniotic bleeding, placental location, and fetal-maternal hemorrhage. It was hoped to then determine which Rh-negative patients should receive Rh immunoglobulin. Visualized intraamniotic bleeding showed no correlation to fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Intraamniotic bleeding was commonly associated with needle insertion through an anterior placenta, but also occurred regardless of placental location and in the absence of placental needle traversal. No correlation was found between placental location and fetal-maternal hemorrhage as evidenced by evaluation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein. The Kleihauer test was not as sensitive as alpha-fetoprotein.
