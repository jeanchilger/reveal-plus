Human germinal mutagenic effects in relation to intentional and accidental exposure to toxic agents. This paper presents examples of epidemiological evaluation of exposure- and cluster-type mutations in human populations. The self-poisoning model did not show that offspring born from mothers after a semi-lethal self-poisoning had higher rates of prenatal selection (fetal death) or abnormalities due to germinal mutations however, an intrauterine growth retardation was found. The surveillance function of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry has detected many cluster-type situations, one example of which is an extreme increase of Down's syndrome in a small Hungarian village in 1989 to 1990. Environmental investigations have pointed to the excessive use of trichlorfon at local fish farms as the cause.
