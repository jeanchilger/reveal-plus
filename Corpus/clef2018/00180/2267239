Discordant findings in chorionic villus direct preparation and long term culture--mosaicism in the fetus. Prenatal cytogenetic study of chorionic villi showed a discrepancy between a normal female karyotype 46,XX in the direct preparation after short-term incubation, and a 45,X karyotype in the long-term culture. The subsequent amniocentesis revealed a normal karyotype in three cultures and a 45,X/46,XX mosaicism in one culture. Cytogenetic analysis of chorionic villi after termination of the pregnancy showed a normal karyotype in the direct preparation and a 45,X/46,XX mosaicism in the long-term culture. Fetal lymphocytes showed normal karyotypes, whereas fibroblast cultures revealed a 45,X/46,XX mosaicism.
