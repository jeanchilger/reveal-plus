Small marker chromosome mosaicism confirmed in two cases ascertained prenatally. Two cases of chromosomal mosaicism were prenatally diagnosed and confirmed in tissues cultured from subsequently aborted fetuses. In both cases a small marker chromosome was observed which proved de novo in origin, since parental chromosomes were normal. The implications and interpretation of such findings in counselling families undergoing amniocenteses is discussed. Mosaicism for small marker chromosomes may be more frequent than hitherto suggested.
