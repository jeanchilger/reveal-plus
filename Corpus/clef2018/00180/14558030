Fetal cells and DNA in maternal blood. Although fetal cells have been known to escape to the maternal circulation for a number of years, research attempts to use them for prenatal diagnosis have not had any consistent success. This review attempts to trace the history of such attempts and to document their progress and reasons for success or failure. The opinions of recent conferences including that of the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a sponsor of major US research in the field, are reported and discussed. It is concluded that although basic work has demonstrated the biologic availability of both fetal cells and their free DNA representatives in the maternal circulation at gestational ages relevant to prenatal diagnosis, much work remains to develop practical technology for their consistent recovery and assay.
