A case of mosaic trisomy 2 diagnosed at amniocentesis in an abnormal fetus and confirmed in multiple fetal tissues. Pseudomosaicism for trisomy 2 is a relatively common finding at amniocentesis. However, genuine trisomy 2 mosaicism is extremely rare. As a result, very few cases have been described and little information is available with which to counsel the parents of an affected fetus. We describe a case of mosaic trisomy 2 diagnosed at amniocentesis in a fetus with multiple anomalies on ultrasound scan. Following termination of pregnancy, the fetus was found to have mild dysmorphic features, together with an absent gall bladder, cystic left kidney, a 13th left rib and mild unilateral talipes. The presence of trisomy 2 cells was confirmed by both standard cytogenetic analysis and fluorescent in-situ hybridisation techniques in multiple fetal tissues, as well as in the cord and placenta.
