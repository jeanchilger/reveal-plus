Second trimester levels of maternal serum inhibin A, total inhibin, alpha inhibin precursor, and activin in Down's syndrome pregnancy. To determine the levels of various biochemical forms of the placental protein, inhibin (total inhibin, inhibin A, and alpha inhibin precursor) and activin in maternal serum samples from fetal Down's syndrome, and to determine which of these analytes most effectively identifies samples from affected pregnancies.Maternal serum samples were collected from 100 unaffected pregnancies and 20 cases of fetal Down's syndrome during gestational weeks 15-20 for routine triple marker screening, and were stored frozen after clinical assay. Levels of inhibin A, total inhibin, alpha inhibin precursor (pro-alphaC), and activin were compared retrospectively in the Down's syndrome cases and control samples.There was no association of the inhibin or activin levels with gestational age or length of freezer storage, and therefore single median values were determined for the unaffected pregnancies for each analyte. Multiples of the unaffected median (MoM) values were calculated for all cases, showing that inhibin A (1.95 MoM) provided the best discrimination between cases and controls, followed by total inhibin (1.37 MoM). Mann-Whitney U analysis showed significant group differences in inhibin A (P = 0.0001) and total inhibin (P = 0.0005). In contrast, alpha inhibin precursor (0.81 MoM) and activin (1.16 MoM) levels in Down's syndrome cases were not significantly different from those in unaffected patients.Levels of inhibin A and total inhibin, but not alpha inhibin precursor or activin, are significantly raised in maternal serum from cases of fetal Down's syndrome. These data, taken together, indicate that inhibin A levels are specifically raised in Down's syndrome pregnancy. 45% of the inhibin A levels in the Down's syndrome samples were above the 90th centile of unaffected levels, indicating that inhibin A may be as good a marker as human chorionic gonadotrophin, the most informative serum marker currently in use.
