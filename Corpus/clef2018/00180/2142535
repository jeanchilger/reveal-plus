Chorionic villi sampling: experience of the initial 500 samples. We report our experience in first trimester antenatal diagnosis since 1984. Transcervical chorionic villus sampling (CVS) was performed in 498 pregnancies. The rate of abnormal pregnancies was 6%, the rate of chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy) in the indication group "maternal age" was 2%. The fetal loss rate (until 28 weeks) was 3.4% (17 cases), the procedure related loss plus the background loss was 2.4% (12 cases). For 92.8% of the patients a diagnosis was available after 1 CVS procedure. Ultimately an antenatal diagnosis was given to 99% of the women through a second CVS procedure or an amniocentesis or a cordocentesis. No maternal complication was observed.
