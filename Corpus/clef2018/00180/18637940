Depression during pregnancy: the potential impact of increased risk for fetal aneuploidy on maternal mood. Depression during pregnancy can have serious consequences for families. Indications of fetal aneuploidy can induce maternal stress, a risk factor for depression. Few studies have assessed symptoms of depression in pregnant women soon after they receive results indicating increased risk for fetal aneuploidy. We compared symptoms of depression in women who had increased risks for fetal aneuploidy with two other groups of pregnant women at similar gestational ages: controls, and women taking antidepressant medications (MEDS). Eighty-one women attending the British Columbia (BC) Medical Genetics (MG) Program regarding positive maternal serum screens or ultrasound soft marker findings completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Control (n = 41) and MEDS (n = 41) groups were recruited from the community or the BC Reproductive Mental Health program. A threshold score of 12 on the EPDS was used to calculate percentages of women likely to be depressed. Mean EPDS scores were compared using anova, followed by post-hoc tests. In the control, MG, and MEDS groups, 2.4%, 35%, and 52.4% of women, respectively, scored above 12. Mean EPDS score was significantly higher in the MG group than in the control group (p < 0.0001). These results suggest a place for depression screening in prenatal genetic counseling.
