Changing indications for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an attractive addition to prenatal genetic diagnosis. Not only were traditional PGD indications valid, but newer indications should be envisioned. The major new indication is aneuploidy testing by PGD for transfer of euploid embryos. This could increase fertilization success in ART, and extend to couples experiencing repeated IVF failures or repeated spontaneous abortions. Other novel indications can be envisioned for the future.
