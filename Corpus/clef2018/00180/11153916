Multilocus genetic analysis of single interphase cells by spectral imaging. Numerical chromosome aberrations are detrimental to early embryonic, fetal and perinatal development of mammals. When fetuses carrying a chromosomal imbalance survive to term, an aberrant gene dosage typically leads to stillbirth or causes a severely altered phenotype. Aneuploidy of any of the 24 chromosomes will negatively impact on human development, and a preimplantation and prenatal genetic diagnosis test should thus score as many chromosomes as possible. Since cells available for analysis are likely to be in interphase, we set out to develop a rapid enumeration procedure based on hybridization of chromosome-specific probes and spectral imaging detection. The probe set was chosen to allow the simultaneous enumeration of ten chromosome types and was expected to detect more than 70% of all numerical chromosome aberrations responsible for spontaneous abortions, i.e., human chromosomes 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y. Cell fixation protocols were optimized to achieve the desired detection sensitivity and reproducibility. We were able to resolve and identify ten separate chromosomal signals in interphase nuclei from different types of cells, including lymphocytes, uncultured amniocytes, and blastomeres. In summary, this study demonstrates the strength of spectral imaging, allowing us to construct partial spectral imaging karyotypes for individual interphase cells by assessing the number of each of the target chromosome types.
