Sex chromosomes, micronuclei and aging in women. Several studies on aneuploidy and aging have shown a significant increase in the loss of chromosomes in both males and females with age. Others have observed a significant increase in micronucleus formation in lymphocytes with age. The objectives of this investigation were to determine the relationship between sex chromosome loss and increased micronucleus frequencies with age, to establish sex chromosome loss frequencies unbiased by cellular survival factors or slide preparation, and to determine the effect of smoking on sex chromosome loss. Blood samples were obtained from 8 newborn females and 38 adult females ranging in age from 19 to 77. Isolated lymphocytes were cultured according to standard techniques and blocked with cytochalasin B. Two thousand binucleated cells per donor were scored using a modified micronucleus assay to determine the kinetochore status of each micronucleus. Slides were then hybridized with a 2.0 kb centromeric X chromosome-specific probe labeled with biotinylated dUTP, and detected with fluorescein-conjugated avidin. All micronucleated cells were relocated and their X chromosome status was determined. We found the X chromosome to be present in 72.2% of the micronuclei scored additionally our results show a significant increase with age in the number of micronuclei containing an X chromosome.
