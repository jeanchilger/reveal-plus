Maternal serum free alpha- and free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin in pregnancies with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: implications for screening for Down's syndrome. A study was performed to investigate the concentrations of the alpha and beta free sub-units of human chorionic gonadotrophin (free alpha-hCG and free beta-hCG) in maternal serum between 15 and 22 weeks of pregnancy in 126 pregnancies among 92 women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Each IDDM pregnancy was matched with two control singleton pregnancies for gestational age (same completed week) and duration of sample storage (same calendar quarter). The median free alpha-hCG level in the IDDM pregnancies was 0.86 multiples of the median (MOM) for pregnancies without IDDM at the same gestational age (P < 0.002) (95 per cent confidence interval 0.80-0.94). The corresponding free beta-hCG level was 0.96 MOM (95 per cent confidence interval 0.85-1.09). These results enable free alpha-hCG values to be adjusted so that antenatal screening for Down's syndrome can be performed using this marker in IDDM pregnancies as well as in non-diabetic pregnancies.
