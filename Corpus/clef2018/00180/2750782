Validity of cytogenetic analyses from trophoblast tissue throughout gestation. Cytogenetic findings in the Münster Chorionic Villi Sampling (CVS) program are presented after 1,184 first trimester transcervical samplings and 131 second and third trimester placentacenteses. In the first trimester series the abnormality rate is low (2.4%) in patients with only an age-dependent aneuploidy risk. In this group terminations were performed in only 1.6% because of aneuploidy. True mosaicism was found more frequently after CVS, and the risk of maternal cell contamination seems higher as compared to amniocentesis. There are no obvious differences in the overall rate of diagnostic errors after both procedures, when metaphases after direct preparation and chorionic cell cultures are analysed and doubtful findings such as mosaicism are adequately followed up by amniocentesis. The cytogenetic techniques also offer a very rapid approach to karyotyping in the second and third trimester. We found a high rate of aneuploidy (15%) when placentacentesis was performed after sonographic diagnosis of fetal abnormalities. We conclude that cytogenetic analysis from trophoblast tissue is an accurate diagnostic tool applicable from first to third trimester of pregnancy.
