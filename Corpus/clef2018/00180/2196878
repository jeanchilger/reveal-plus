Expression of a normal and variant Alzheimer's beta-protein gene in amyloid of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage, Dutch type: DNA and protein diagnostic assays. Amyloid fibrils deposited in cerebral vessel walls in Dutch patients with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (HCHWA-D) are formed by polymerization of a 39-residue peptide similar to the beta-protein of Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy and normal aging. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA in HCHWA-D patients demonstrated a point mutation, cytosine for guanine at position 1852 of the precursor beta-protein gene, which causes a single amino acid substitution (glutamine for glutamic acid) corresponding to position 22 of the amyloid protein. The normal allele was also present in these patients. To examine the expression of normal and variant beta-protein alleles in HCHWA-D we analyzed all the tryptic peptides obtained from several amyloid fractions from leptomeningeal vascular walls. Amino acid sequence of two peptides (T3a and T3b) with identical amino acid composition revealed that T3a had glutamine and T3b had glutamic acid at position 22. Thus both the normal and variant Alzheimer's beta-protein alleles are expressed in vascular amyloid in HCHWA-D and may be detected by tryptic peptide mapping. Moreover, we have developed a diagnostic assay for high risk populations and prenatal evaluation that is based on the existence of the mutation.
