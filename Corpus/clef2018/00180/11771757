Reduction of nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor beta and histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein in fetal Down syndrome brain. Information on the various factors leading to impairments in the developing brain of fetal Down Syndrome patients is limited to few histological reports. We therefore attempted to describe expression levels of proteins in brain using the proteomic technique of two-dimensional electrophoresis with subsequent mass spectroscopical identification of protein spots and quantification with specific software. Cortical tissue was obtained from autopsy of human fetal abortus. Protein levels of GTP-binding nuclear protein ran, guanine nucleotide-binding protein g(o), alpha subunit 2, guanine nucleotide-binding protein g(i)/g(s)/g(t) beta subunit 1, -beta subunit 2, guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta subunit 5, nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor beta, Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1, biphosphate 3'-nucleotidase, small glutamine-rich tetra-tricopeptide repeat-containing protein and histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein were studied. Quantification revealed statistically significant reduced levels of nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, Rab GDP-dissociation inhibitor beta and histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein in fetal DS brain as compared to controls. We conclude that in early prenatal life proteins involved in neural differentiation, migration and synaptic transmission are impaired in DS cortex. These results may help to understand the abundant mechanisms leading to abnormalities in the wiring, structure and function of DS brain.
