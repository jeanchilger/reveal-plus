Thyrotropin binding inhibitor immunoglobulin. Its pathogenetic importance in hypothyroidism. Two patients with hypothyroidism had detectable serum levels of thyrotropin binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII). Patient 1 was a newborn infant who had transient neonatal hypothyroidism due to transfer of TBII from the mother with nongoitrous autoimmune thyroiditis. Patient 2 was an 8-year-old girl with Down's syndrome who presented with signs of myxedema and central precocious puberty. She had no goiter, and the recognition of thyroid disease was delayed the histological diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis was established by aspiration biopsy, and TBII had strong thyroid adenyl cyclase-inhibiting activity in vitro. It appears that TBII may be pathogenetically important for occurrence of neonatal hypothyroidism and nongoitrous autoimmune thyroiditis without goiter.
