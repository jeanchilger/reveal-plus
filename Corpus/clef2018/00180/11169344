Fetal echogenic bowel: parameters to be considered in differential diagnosis. To evaluate the extent that associated findings aid in the differential diagnosis and/or prognosis of fetal echogenic bowel.Medical history, obstetric records and outcome details were examined for 131 consecutive pregnancies with fetal hyperechogenic bowel.In 62 (47%) cases, there were no visible anomalies other than hyperechogenic bowel and no evidence of growth restriction. This group included four (7%) pregnancies with Down syndrome, 15 (24%) with infection or a recent episode of influenza and eight (13%) with blood staining of amniotic fluid. In the remaining 69 (53%) cases, hyperechogenic bowel was accompanied by hydrops or nuchal edema (n = 16, 12.2%), growth restriction (n = 9, 6.9%), other markers for chromosome anomalies (n = 33, 25.2%) or multiple structural anomalies (n = 11, 8.4%). In this group, the prevalence of Down syndrome was 12%, infection or influenza was reported in 14 (20%) cases and there was blood staining of amniotic fluid in seven (10%). Cystic fibrosis screening was performed in 65 (50%) pregnancies the results were negative in all cases and clinical assessment did not indicate cystic fibrosis in any of the 91 infants who were born alive. Maternal serum screening was performed in 41 (31%) pregnancies. High alpha-fetoprotein levels were associated with multiple abnormalities or severe growth restriction.In many pregnancies with fetal hyperechogenic bowel, there are multiple factors that may explain these findings. Thus identification of one potential underlying cause should not preclude further testing. Once chromosome defects, cystic fibrosis, structural abnormalities, infection and growth restriction have been excluded, parents can be counseled that the prognosis is good, irrespective of the presence or absence of blood stained amniotic fluid.
