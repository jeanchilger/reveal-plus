The scope of prenatal diagnostic testing for chromosomal aberrations: broad or narrow? Ethical considerations on the choice of tests. In the Netherlands prenatal diagnosis after screening for chromosomal abnormalities is done by karyotyping and is restricted to pregnant women with an increased risk of a child with trisomy 21, 18 or 13. However, karyotyping will detect a wider range of chromosomal abnormalities. Replacing karyotyping by rapid aneuploidy diagnosis (RAD) - a test with a more narrow scope - is currently under discussion. A possible drawback of RAD is that some rare but clinically relevant abnormalities may be missed. A possible advantage is that pregnant women will not be confronted with outcomes that the screening was not initially directed at. Each delineation of the scope of prenatal testing implies a normative choice that requires justification. Moral principles can be invoked for both narrowing down and further broadening of the scope of testing.
