Prenatal detection of simian crease. We present the prenatal detection of a simian crease (transverse palmar line) in seven fetuses. Three fetuses had trisomy 21, four had normal chromosomes but another anomaly (meningomyelocele, thanatophoric dysplasia, achondroplasia [2]). The technique used and normal anatomy are described.
