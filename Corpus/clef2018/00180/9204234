Progress in the genetic analysis of fetal cells circulating in maternal blood. The presence of fetal cells in maternal blood has been demonstrated by many investigators who continue to refine methods to permit their isolation, identification and genetic analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of this technique for noninvasive aneuploidy detection is currently being addressed in a multicenter clinical trial. Significant advances have also occurred in fetal single-cell and single-gene analysis.
