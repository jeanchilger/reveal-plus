Current value of preimplantation genetic aneuploidy screening in IVF. Preimplantation genetic aneuploidy screening (PGS) has been performed during the last decade as a way of enhancing embryo selection in patients with an increased incidence of embryonic numerical chromosome abnormalities (advanced maternal age, recurrent miscarriage and recurrent implantation failure). It has been proposed that the replacement of euploid embryos in these patients would result in a higher implantation and pregnancy rate and a reduced miscarriage rate. Additionally, the transfer of fewer embryos could reduce the chances for multiple pregnancies in all IVF patients. Although, to date, multiple studies have addressed this issue, contradictory results have been encountered. As a result, the effectiveness of aneuploidy screening remains to be established. Moreover, child outcome studies documenting the safety of this procedure are needed. The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence concerning the use of PGS to determine the current value of the technique.
