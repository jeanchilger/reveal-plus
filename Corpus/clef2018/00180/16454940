Relationship between embryo quality and aneuploidies. Many high-grade embryos selected for transfer according to their morphological evaluation were detected to have chromosomal abnormalities after aneuploidy screening for infertility by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). The aim of this study was to detect if there is any correlation between embryo quality and genetic status. The chromosomal status of the day three embryos was studied by multicolour fluorescence in-situ hybridization for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. PGD was performed on 132 patients for 1107 embryos. The correlation between embryo quality and aneuploidy was analysed. The analysis showed that a large proportion of normal embryos (50.7%, n = 280) were grade I. In addition, a considerably high proportion of aneuploid embryos (36.1%, n = 83) were evaluated as grade I. There was a significant relationship between PGD results and embryo grades (P = 0.001). Of the 69 polyploid embryos, 21.7% were grade I and 37.8% were grade II. Of the 83 haploid embryos, 27.8% were grade I and 34.9% were grade II. Euploidy was positively related to morphological grade of embryo (P = 0.001). It was also possible for chromosomally abnormal embryos to have a good developmental potential, and they could be selected for embryo transfer unless the PGD procedure was applied.
