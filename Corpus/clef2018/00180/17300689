Fronto-nasal dysplasia and atrio-ventricular canal in a fetus with trisomy 18 identified by absent nasal bones during first trimester screening scan. Failed ultrasonographic visualization of nasal bones is associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations. Maternal ethnicity and chromosomal abnormalities influence the incidence and visualization rate of nasal bones. A case of absent nasal bones with fronto-nasal dysplasia and septated cystic hygroma identified at 13(+5) weeks' gestation in a trisomy 18 fetus is reported. The crown-rump length was 82 mm and the absent nasal bones were associated with micrognathia and a flattened face. The risks for trisomy 21 and 18 were subsequently calculated. The couple refused chorionic villus sampling. At 19 weeks' gestation a follow-up scan revealed, apart from the resolution of septated cystic hygroma, hypertelorism, a large interventricular septum defect with an atrio-ventricular canal and an abnormal A wave Doppler pulsation at the level of the ductus venosus. Bilateral choroid plexus cysts were additional ultrasound findings. At that time, an uneventful cordocentesis was performed showing a 47,XY(+18) karyotype. Termination of pregnancy was achieved and pathologic examination confirmed the ultrasonographically detected fetal malformations. When screening the fetal face for the presence or absence of nasal bones during the first trimester pregnancy scan the following points must be taken into consideration: (i) the ethnicity of the mother (ii) if the nasal bones are absent, measurement of nuchal translucency and risk calculations for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 should be performed
