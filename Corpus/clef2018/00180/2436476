Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and fetal trisomy-21 in women 35 years and older: implications for alpha-fetoprotein screening programs. A retrospective study of 3,411 women who underwent midtrimester amniocentesis for fetal chromosome analysis between June 1979 and August 1984 was performed to evaluate an association between low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations and Down syndrome (DS) pregnancies. A total of 71 pregnancies was found with abnormal fetal chromosomes of these, 26 cases were trisomy-21 and 10 cases were trisomy-18. The maternal serum AFP in women with DS fetuses was relatively lower than levels in women with fetuses that had normal chromosomes. In addition, the AFP concentrations in amniotic fluid were decreased in cases involving DS fetuses. We have estimated the risks for DS pregnancy at all maternal ages and most serum AFP concentrations. Using these calculations, genetic counselors will be able to provide more accurate risk estimates for trisomy-21 following maternal serum AFP testing.
