Prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Microdeletion of chromosome 22q11.2, the most common human deletion syndrome encompasses a wide spectrum of abnormalities. Many clinical or ultrasonographic findings may support deletion studies, either in utero or in the post-natal period. The objective of our study was to evaluate the circumstances of 22q11.2 deletion diagnosis in a single centre of genetics during a 12 years period. Testing for 22q11.2 deletion was performed in 883 cases. Congenital heart defect was the most common reason for referral. An antenatal 22q11.2 microdeletion was detected in 8 fetuses (4.7%) among 169 pregnancies, all presenting conotruncal anomalies. In one case prenatal diagnosis led to the identification of the deletion in the mildly affected father and had negative impact on the family. During the same period, postnatal 22q11.2 DS was diagnosed in 81 out of 714 patients aged from birth to 42 years (11.3%) (p = 0.02). A CHD was present in 37 (45.7%). This figure is significantly lower than the 75% commonly reported. These results suggest that deletion studies could be justifiable in fetuses with non-cardiac prenatal sonographic findings that have been reported in association with 22q11.2 DS. However, as most of these malformations are rather common and non specific, systematic 22q11.2 testing is not justifiable. In such cases, careful cardiac and thymus examination could provide additional clues for 22q11.2 testing. In addition parents should be given accurate information before antenatal or postnatal testing, including the wide variability of the clinical phenotype, the impossibility to establish a precise prognosis concerning psychomotor development and psychiatric risks.
