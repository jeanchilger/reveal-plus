Noninvasive methods used in prenatal diagnosis. Research in developing methods for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis has focused on the following: the isolation of fetal cells from the cervix, from the blood of pregnant women and the isolation of the fetal DNA. In the paper authors review the potential clinical diagnostic applications of fetal cells and fetal DNA analysis in maternal plasma or serum and fetal cells in cervical mucus for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis and screening of fetal aneuploidy, gene mutations, preeclampsia and preterm labor.
