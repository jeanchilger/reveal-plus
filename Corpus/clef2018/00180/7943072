Isolated choroid plexus cyst(s): an indication for amniocentesis. Our purpose was to prospectively evaluate the risk of chromosomal abnormalities associated with isolated choroid plexus cyst(s) in gravid women undergoing second-trimester ultrasonographic examination.During a 24-month period 9100 pregnant women underwent midtrimester ultrasonographic evaluation. Women with a fetal diagnosis of choroid plexus cyst(s) were offered amniocentesis and a repeat examination in 4 to 6 weeks.A diagnosis of choroid plexus cyst(s) was made in 102 fetuses (1.1%). In four of these fetuses multiple congenital anomalies were noted. Three of the four fetuses had a chromosomal abnormality, two trisomy 18 and one unbalanced translocation, t(313). In the remaining 98 fetuses the choroid plexus cysts were isolated findings, that is, there were no other ultrasonographically detected anomalies. Seventy-five of these 98 fetuses underwent amniocentesis. An abnormal karyotype was identified in four fetuses: three had Down syndrome (two trisomy 21 and one unbalanced translocation, t[14In our prospective study the risk of chromosomal abnormality with isolated choroid plexus cyst(s) was 1:25, a risk that exceeds the 1:200 risk of pregnancy loss after amniocentesis and the 1:126 and 1:260 risk for aneuploidy and Down syndrome, respectively, in a 35-year-old pregnant women during the midtrimester. These findings indicate that amniocentesis should be offered to pregnant women in the presence of isolated fetal choroid plexus cyst(s).
