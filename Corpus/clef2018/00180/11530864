Differential expression of Bcl-2 proto-oncogene in the trophoblast from embryos with Down's syndrome and those after spontaneous abortion. Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) was the first human chromosomal syndrome to be recognized (in 1959 by Lejeune and colleagues). It is also the most frequent chromosomal aberration occurring in one out of 700 live newborns. In the present study we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of the apoptosis-suppressing protein Bcl-2 in placental trophoblastic cells from embryos with Down's syndrome (gestational age 12th, 15th and 22nd week) and correlated the findings with equivalent trophoblastic cells from embryos after spontaneous abortion. In our cases with Down's syndrome a weak Bcl-2 expression was noted in the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast of chorionic villi in contrast to strong Bcl-2 staining of the same cells in the cases of spontaneous abortions (p < 0.0001). Although there are no specific findings that truly characterize a placenta with trisomy, obtaining a small piece of chorionic villus tissue (chorionic villus biopsy) and immunohistochemical control for Bcl-2 protein could be an additional prenatal examination available to the perinatologist to detect chromosomal abnormalities.
