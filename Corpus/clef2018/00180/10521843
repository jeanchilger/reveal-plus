Detection of aneuploidy in single cells using comparative genomic hybridization. The ability of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect aneuploidy following universal amplification of DNA from a single cell, or a small number of cells, was investigated with a view to preimplantation diagnosis following in vitro fertilization, and prenatal diagnosis using fetal erythroblasts obtained from maternal blood. The DNA obtained from lysed single cells was amplified using degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR). This product was labelled using nick translation and hybridized together with normal reference genomic DNA. The CGH fluorescent ratio profiles obtained could be used to determine aneuploidy with cut-off thresholds of 0.75 and 1.25. Deviation in the profiles in the heterochromatic regions was reduced by using, as a reference sample, normal genomic DNA that had also undergone DOP-PCR. Single cells known to be trisomic for chromosomes 13, 18 or 21 were analysed using this technique. The resolution of CGH with amplified DNA from a single cell is of the order of 40 Mb, sufficient for the diagnosis of trisomy 21, and possibly segmental aneuploidy of equivalent size. These results, and those of others, demonstrate that diagnosis of chromosomal aneuploidy in single cells is possible using CGH with DOP-PCR amplified DNA.
