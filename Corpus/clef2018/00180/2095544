Prenatal diagnosis and characteristics of chromosome aberrations in families with genetic risk. Characteristics of the chromosomal aberrations diagnosed in 959 prenatal tests in the II trimester of pregnancy is presented. Chromosomal aberrations were diagnosed in 33 tests (3.4%). Twenty one out of these aberrations (2.2%) were of labile character. Six aberrations resulted from the parental segregation, translocation or chromosomal inversion. In 12 cases fetus inherited stable aberration from one of parents. It amounted to 1.2% of all tested cases. Chromosomal aberrations were diagnosed in 2.7% cases tested due to the risk related to the mother's age. Half of them was trisomy of chromosome 21. Chromosomal aneuploidy in the progeny of families with a child with the same abnormality was diagnosed in 1.6% of cases. Chromosomal mosaicism was diagnosed in 2.2% of cases including 0.2% of cases with true mosaicism and 1.98% of cases with pseudomosaicism. Incidence and type of the diagnosed chromosomal aberrations coincided with foreseen aberrations for each group of the genetic risk.
