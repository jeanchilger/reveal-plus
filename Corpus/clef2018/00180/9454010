Serum screening of pregnant women reveals Down syndrome. Analysis of biochemical markers for earlier detection. Second trimester maternal serum screening for fetal Down's syndrome (DS), using the AFP (alpha-fetoprotein), hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) and uE3 (unconjugated oestriol) triple test, is as well documented procedure associated with a DS-detection rate of about 70 per cent, for an amniocentesis rate of about 7 per cent. The triple test is relatively little used in the Nordic countries, though its wider use would result in more efficient diagnosis of DS and various fetal malformtions. The maternal age indication currently used leaves gravidae under 35 years of age without prenatal diagnostics, although it is in just this age group that the majority (70 per cent) of cases of fetal DS occur. In Denmark, where 12 per cent of gravidae undergo invasive diagnostic procedures, the proportion of induced abortions due to the procedures is far too high, in relation to the DS detection rates obtained. Maternal serum screening yields a much better ratio between the risk of abortion after amniocentesis and the likelihood of DS detection than does maternal age alone. Maternal serum screening at 7-14 weeks of gestation, using pregnancy-associated plasma protein A and free hCG beta subunit concentrations, will become available within the next few years, thus reducing the incidence of some of the psychological and technical problems associated with second trimester screening, especially that of third trimester abortion. Irrespective of whether it is performed in the first or the second trimester, maternal serum screening will be the cornerstone of prenatal DS diagnosis in the future.
