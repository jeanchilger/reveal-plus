Taurodontism: an anomaly of teeth reflecting disruptive developmental homeostasis. Two models concerning morphometric traits occurring frequently in aneuploidy states posit, respectively, 1) that they reflect the expression of specific major oligogenes for that trait on the chromosome involved or 2) that they result from a generalized disruption of developmental homeostasis. In contrast to previous studies that have investigated variations in morphometric traits in a single aneuploidy state, this study investigates a single morphometric trait, taurodontism, as it occurs in otherwise normal individuals, in nonchromosomal syndromes, and in aneuploidy syndromes to determine whether the trait best fits the oligogene or the disrupted developmental homeostasis model. Taurodontism is diagnosed from dental radiographs. It is an extreme variation in tooth form seen in multirooted teeth in which the bifurcation or trifurcation of the roots is displaced toward the apex of the root, resulting in increased size of the pulp chamber. The point of furcation, and consequently the size of the pulp chamber, is a quasicontinuously distributed trait. The results indicate that taurodontism most likely is the result of disrupted developmental homeostasis.
