A supernumerary microchromosome in amniotic cell cultures and talipes equinovarus in a live born female. Amniocentesis for advanced maternal age resulted in the demonstration of a supernumerary microchromosome in the amniotic fluid cells. Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood from the female infant revealed a mosaic karyotype 46,XX/47,XX, + marker. The only anomaly noted in the infant was talipes equinovarus.
