Proteomic determination of metabolic enzymes of the amnion cell: basis for a possible diagnostic tool? Amniocentesis is a valuable and standard procedure for prenatal diagnosis of genetic or inborn errors of metabolism. Amnion cells are cultivated and chromosomes or proteins can be examined to provide molecular diagnosis. Mainly individual proteins are searched for based upon pedigrees and/or anamnesis. As inborn errors of metabolism involve a vast diversity of metabolic enzymes, we aimed to find a screening method for a large series of metabolic enzymes. Amnion cells were obtained from amniocentesis and subjected to proteomic analysis. We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with in-gel digestion followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight analysis, to identify metabolic enzymes. Furthermore, we compared metabolic proteins in amnion cells from controls with those from Down Syndrome (DS). Enzymes involved in carbohydrate handling, amino acid handling, -purine metabolism and intermediary metabolism as well as miscellaneous metabolic pathways were detected. Protein levels of several enzymes were significantly deranged in samples obtained from patients with DS. This approach, with the advantage of the concomitant determination of many enzyme proteins, may form the basis for future metabolic screens when amniocentesis is carried out.
