Highly abnormal maternal inhibin and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels along with severe HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome at 17 weeks' gestation with triploidy. A 17-week pregnancy complicated by severe hypertension is reported. The fetus had multiple anomalies and was found to have triploidy. Assay of maternal serum markers for trisomy 21 revealed elevated levels of inhibin (137.51 multiples of the median) and human chorionic gonadotropin (41.51 multiples of the median).
