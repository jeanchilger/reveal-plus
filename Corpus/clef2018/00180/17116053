Mapping uptake of prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome and other chromosome abnormalities across Victoria, Australia. To investigate geodemographic characteristics of women having prenatal diagnosis for Down syndrome and other fetal chromosome abnormalities in Victoria, Australia.A descriptive analysis of population-based data on all confinements, amniocenteses and chorionic villus sampling for 1998 and 2002 was undertaken. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of 2002 data investigated geographical differences, including selected maternal features and a socioeconomic status measure that may be associated with uptake of diagnostic testing.After adjusting for age, parity of three or more children was associated with a significantly decreased likelihood of testing (P<0.001). Women from Africa were 61% less likely to have testing than women born in Australia (P<0.01). While overall uptake of testing was lower than average in rural regions, only the Loddon Mallee had a significantly decreased likelihood of testing (OR 0.71 (0.53, 0.95), P=0.02). A socioeconomic index of place of residence showed no association with uptake. Metropolitan and rural women giving birth in private hospitals were 31 and 60% more likely to have a test than women giving birth in public hospitals (P<0.01).Geographical differences influence uptake of prenatal diagnosis, probably related to access to services. However, other maternal demographic factors also play a role in uptake. To ensure equity in access and autonomy in women's reproductive choices, reasons for exceptionally low uptake in certain localities or within certain subgroups of pregnant women should be investigated further, followed by appropriate changes in service provision.
