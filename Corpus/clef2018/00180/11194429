Parental decision-making differences between patients in two healthcare systems for choroid plexus cysts. We evaluated the medical-sociological implications of parental perception of risk and decision-making choices for prenatally ascertained choroid plexus cysts (CPC) between two obstetric populations. The Wayne State University (WSU) Reproductive Genetics database and the Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC) experience were reviewed to compare the rates of aneuploidy and invasive testing for cases with CPC. Aneuploidy rates were compared between those with isolated CPC, CPC with advanced maternal age (AMA), and CPC associated with multiple anomalies. In the WSU cohort 186 cases were identified, of whom 27 (15%) declined invasive fetal testing. In the remaining 159 cases, aneuploidy was present in 2/132 (1.5%) isolated CPC, 3/11 (27%) CPC with AMA, and 15/16 (93%) CPC with multiple anomalies. In the MAMC cohort 107 cases were identified, of whom 99 (92%) declined invasive fetal testing. No aneuploidy cases were found in the 3/12 AMA cases or 5/95 non-AMA cases that underwent amniocentesis. The two cases of aneuploidy with isolated CPC cannot be ignored, and provide an estimated attributable risk of at least 0.8%, a higher risk than 38 years of age. However, the parental sociologic context may be as important for decision-making as the genetic-prognostic risk.
