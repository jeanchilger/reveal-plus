Prenatal diagnosis of transient abnormal myelopoiesis in a Down syndrome fetus. We report a case of transient abnormal myelopoiesis in a Down syndrome fetus diagnosed at 28(+3) weeks of gestation that rapidly progressed to intrauterine death 10 days later. Fetal hepatosplenomegaly with cerebral ventriculomegaly, although not specific, may be a suggestive finding of Down syndrome with transient abnormal myelopoiesis. Prompt fetal blood sampling for liver function test and chromosomal analysis are mandatory for early detection and management.
