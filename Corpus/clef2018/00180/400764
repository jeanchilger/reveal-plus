Mosaicism in amniotic fluid cell cultures: classification and significance. The last decade has witnessed increasing application of human cytogenetic technology to prenatal chromosome analysis. However, unlike the rather uniform peripheral blood T-lymphocyte system which has provided most of our experience in human cytogenetics, long-term amniotic-fluid cell cultures display extreme cellular heterogeneity and disproportionate growth of certain cell types as a consequence of clonal amplification. When they enter cell culture, many of these cells are approaching the terminal stages of their respective, life spans and may have accumulated chromosomal aberrations. Concern about the possibility of true fetal mosaicism seems warranted chiefly in situations were multiple colonies display potentially viable aberrations. Clonal analysis, preferably of multiple clonal types, and attention to details of clonal morphology are likely to minimize diagnostic errors and undue apprehension resulting from mosaicism in amniotic-fluid cell cultures.
