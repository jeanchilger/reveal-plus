The multi-dimensional measure of informed choice: a validation study. The aim of this prospective study is to assess the reliability and validity of a multi-dimensional measure of informed choice (MMIC). Participants were 225 pregnant women in two general hospitals in the UK, women receiving low-risk results following serum screening for Down syndrome. The MMIC was administered before testing and the Ottawa Decisional Conflict Scale was administered 6 weeks later. The component scales of the MMIC, knowledge and attitude, were internally consistent (alpha values of 0.68 and 0.78, respectively). Those who made a choice categorised as informed using the MMIC rated their decision 6 weeks later as being more informed, better supported and of higher quality than women whose choice was categorised as uninformed. This provides evidence of predictive validity, whilst the lack of association between the MMIC and anxiety shows construct (discriminant) validity. Thus, the MMIC has been shown to be psychometrically robust in pregnant women offered the choice to undergo prenatal screening for Down syndrome and receiving a low-risk result. Replication of this finding in other groups, facing other decisions, with other outcomes, should be assessed in future research.
