Tandem duplication mosaicism: characterization of a mosaic dup(5q) and review. Mosaicism for tandem duplications is rare. Most patients reported had abnormal phenotypes of varying severity, depending on the chromosomal imbalance involved and the level of mosaicism. Post-zygotic unequal sister-chromatid exchange has been proposed as the main mechanism for tandem duplication mosaicism. However, previous molecular analyses have implicated both meiotic and post-zygotic origins for the duplication. We describe a newborn male who was originally diagnosed in utero with arrhythmia and tetralogy of Fallot. He had multiple dysmorphic features including telecanthus, blepharophimosis, high broad nasal bridge with a square-shaped nose, flat philtrum, thin upper lip, down-turned corners of the mouth, high-arched palate, micrognathia, asymmetric ears, and long, thin fingers and toes. Karyotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes showed mosaicism for a tandem duplication of part of the long arm of one chromosome 5: mos46,XY,dup(5)(q13q33)[6]/46,XY[45]. Fibroblast cultures had the same mosaic karyotype with a higher frequency of the dup(5) clone: mos46,XY,dup(5)(q13q33)[9]/46,XY[21]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with a wcp5 confirmed the chromosome 5 origin of the additional material. Parental karyotypes were normal indicating a de novo origin of the dup(5) in the proband. Molecular analyses of chromosome 5 sequence-tagged-site (STS) markers in our family were consistent with a post-zygotic origin for the duplication. Therefore, mosaicism for tandem duplications can arise both through meiotic or mitotic errors, as a result of unequal crossing over or unequal sister-chromatid exchange, respectively. Our review indicates that mosaicism for tandem duplications is likely under-ascertained and that parental karyotyping of probands with non-mosaic tandem duplications should be performed.
