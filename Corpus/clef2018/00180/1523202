Chorionic mosaicism: association with fetal loss but not with adverse perinatal outcome. Cytogenetic data from the United States NICHD collaborative study of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) were used to evaluate the clinical significance of chorionic mosaicism. The 10,754 patients with normal cytogenetic results were compared with 108 patients (1.0 per cent) with placental mosaicism and 181 patients (1.6 per cent) with pseudo-mosaicism. Of the pregnancies intended to continue, the pregnancy loss rate was significantly greater in patients with placental mosaicism than in the cytogenetically normal cohort (8.6 vs. 3.4 per cent, p less than 0.05). However, there was no difference in the frequencies of abruptio placenta, preterm labour or delivery, small-for-gestational-age newborns, pregnancy-induced hypertension, or neonates with Apgar scores less than 7.
