Ultrasound abnormalities of the amniotic fluid, membranes, umbilical cord, and placenta. Prenatal ultrasound has expanded the ability to assess the umbilical cord, fetal membranes, amniotic fluid volume, and placenta. Evaluation of these structures provides information regarding the intrauterine environment. Umbilical cord abnormalities may be associated with fetal aneuploidy, structural anomalies, and fetal compromise. Estimating the amniotic fluid volume has become an integral part of a sonogram and provides immense information regarding possible fetal anomalies and perinatal outcome. Likewise, placental location or abnormalities may significantly impact obstetric management and prognosis. Early detection of several of these conditions may lead to increased vigilance that may improve perinatal outcome.
