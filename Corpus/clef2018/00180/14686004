Frequency of congenital abnormalities in Hungary after the Chernobyl nuclear power accident. The only positive result of earlier Hungarian teratological investigations on consequences of Chernobyl nuclear power station accident was the description of increased prevalence of birth with less than 2500 g body weight. It was attributed to the concern of the pregnant women, not to the direct effect of ionising radiation.The present study aimed to refine the earlier results by application of sensitive epidemiological techniques.The exposure data observed in the 150 districts of Hungary were correlated with the prevalence of Down syndrome by geographical information system and the monthly detected prevalences were analysed in the function of exposure.The ecological investigation on geographical inequalities revealed that there is no correlation between the district level exposure and Down syndrome prevalence. The time trend analysis on monthly data showed no exposure-related elevation of Down-syndrome occurrence.The results supported the earlier conclusions of the studies that the Chernobyl accident related exposure did not elicited detectable increase of Down syndrome.
