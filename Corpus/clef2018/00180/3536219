Chromosomal mosaicism and maternal cell contamination in chorionic villi cultures. In a series of 110 chromosome analyses, after chorionic villus sampling, mosaics were found in 3 out of 106 long term cultures. In all 3 cases, subsequent amniotic fluid cell cultures showed normal karyotypes. Maternal cell contamination was encountered in one long term culture derived from carefully dissected chorionic villi.
