The origin of abnormalities in recurrent aneuploidy/polyploidy. Recurrent miscarriage due to sporadic chromosomal abnormalities may simply be a consequence of the dramatic increase of trisomic conceptions with increased maternal age. However, it is also possible that some couples are at increased risk of abnormalities as a result of gonadal mosaicism, factors affecting chromosome structure and segregation, increased sperm aneuploidy in the male partner, or accelerated "aging" of the ovaries. We report cytogenetic and molecular findings from 122 spontaneous abortions (SAs) from 54 couples who were ascertained as having two or more documented aneuploid or polyploid SAs. The distribution of abnormalities in this group was similar to those from 307 SAs that involved chromosome abnormalities and were diagnosed at the same center but did not involve documented recurrent aneuploidy/polyploidy. Although recurrence of the same abnormality was observed in eight families, this number was equal to that expected by chance, indicating that gonadal mosaicism is rarely the explanation for recurrence. The origin of the abnormality was determined in 37 SAs from 23 of the couples in the study. A maternal meiotic origin was involved in 30 trisomies and in 1 triploid SA 3 additional maternal trisomies were of possible somatic origin. A paternal origin was found in the remaining two trisomies and in one triploid SA. In addition, one double trisomy was the consequence of both a maternal and a paternal meiotic error. These results confirm that the etiology of trisomy is predominantly a result of meiotic errors related to increased maternal age, regardless of whether the couple has experienced one or multiple aneuploid SAs. Furthermore, this is true even when a second SA involves the same abnormality. Nonetheless, these data do not exclude some population variability in risk for aneuploidy.
