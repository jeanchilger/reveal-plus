Confined placental mosaicism: definition, consequences and outcome. Confined placental mosaicism (CPM) occurs in approximately 2 per cent of viable pregnancies studies by chorionic villus sampling. The great majority of pregnancies with confined placental mosaicism proceed uneventfully, resulting in normal liveborn infants. However, a few specific chromosomal abnormalities have been associated with fetal growth retardation. Fetal karyotype should be checked by amniocentesis and such pregnancies should have careful ultrasound follow-up.
