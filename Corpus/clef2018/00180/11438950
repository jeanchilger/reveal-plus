Prenatal diagnosis of sex chromosome aneuploidy: possible reasons for high rates of pregnancy termination. Sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), when detected in amniocentesis, is usually an unexpected result of a test carried out for another purpose. For most SCAs, the prognosis is milder and less predictable than trisomy 21, and therefore parents are faced with a difficult decision regarding the option of pregnancy termination. While studies from Europe and the USA report a declining trend in termination rates for SCA, our local experience is different. During the period 1989-1998, we diagnosed 60 SCA (including mosaics) in 20 106 amniocenteses (0.29%) and 48 (80%) of these pregnancies were terminated, a significantly higher proportion than has been reported in Europe and the USA. The present study shows that the difference between our experience and others' may be related to differences in cultural norms and values. Thirty women were interviewed, of whom 23 terminated and seven continued the pregnancy. Interview analyses showed that the main reason behind the decision to terminate the pregnancy was associated with the parents' fear of non-specific abnormality of the child, and concerns about abnormal sexual development. Although genetic counseling practised in our center aims to be non-directive, 56% of the women reported that the counseling was either directive towards termination, or that they at least felt that the counselor's attitude was pro-termination. Most women (93%) reported themselves as having come to terms with their decision.
