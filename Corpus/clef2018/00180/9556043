Cardiac gene expression of GATA-4 transcription factor in human trisomy 21 fetuses with increased nuchal translucency. This study examines GATA-4 gene expression in cardiac tissue from fetuses with trisomy 21 presenting with increased nuchal translucency thickness at 10-14 weeks of gestation. mRNA was extracted from cardiac tissue after termination of pregnancy at 10-18 weeks of gestation in ten trisomy 21 fetuses and 29 normal controls. Northern and slot blots were performed and densitometric analysis of slot blots was used to determine the steady-state levels of expression of GATA-4. GATA-4 transcript levels were also compared with ANP and BNP, which have previously been measured in the same panel of samples. GATA-4 expression increased significantly with gestation but there was no significant difference between fetuses with trisomy 21 and controls. There was no significant association between GATA-4 expression and the steady-state level of transcripts for the natriuretic peptides.
