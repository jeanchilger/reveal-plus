Prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis--a current audit. A review of 2000 cases of prenatal cytogenetic diagnoses after amniocentesis, and comparisons with early experience. An audit of 2000 cases of prenatal cytogenetic diagnoses is presented. This comprises two consecutive series of 1000 cases (1974-1980 and 1980-1983). Chromosomal studies were performed after mid-trimester amniocentesis. For both series detailed results of the reasons for referral and the outcome of laboratory studies and pregnancy follow-up (in 95% of cases) are presented. In current practice 75% of prenatal cytogenetic diagnoses were for advanced maternal age. Ten per cent of tests were undertaken because of a family history of Down's syndrome. The detection rate of chromosomal abnormality in prenatal cytogenetic diagnoses was 2.06%. Two per cent of amniotic cell cultures failed to grow, necessitating a repeat amniocentesis. The rate of culture failure due to undefinable causes was 0.55%. Fetal loss after amniocentesis for prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis at 16 weeks' gestation has halved since 1980, with a current miscarriage rate of 0.6% within four weeks of the procedure. One maternal death (as a result of amniotic fluid embolism) and one case of amnionitis occurred in the first series of 1000 consecutive cases (up to 1980), but no such complication has occurred since. Secular trends in the indications for referral, laboratory complications, clinical outcome and diagnostic patterns are presented.
