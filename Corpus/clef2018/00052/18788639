Significance of dual-time-point 18F-FDG PET imaging in evaluation of hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis in non-small-cell lung cancer. To explore the diagnostic value of dual-time-point 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging in detecting hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Forty-six patients with NSCLC underwent standard whole body single-time 18F-FDG PET-CT scans and a delayed imaging for the thorax alone before surgery, meanwhile, the standard uptake value (SUV) and retention index (RI) were calculated.A total number of 584 lymph nodes were excised in the 46 patients. Of these, 134 metastatic lymph nodes were pathologically confirmed in 31 patients. There were 189 lymph nodes detected and suspected to be metastatic by standard single-time 18 F-FDG PET-CT imaging, and 161 by dual-time-point imaging. Therefore, the sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value in the detection of hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis were 87.3%, 84.0%, 84.8%, 61.9% and 95.7% by standard single-time 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging, versus 94.8%, 92.2%, 92.8%, 78.9% and 98.1%, respectively, by dual-time-point imaging. There was a statistically significant difference in the detection of lymph node metastasis between the standard single-time imaging and dual-time-point 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging.Dual-time-point 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging is more sensitive, specific and accurate than standard single-time 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging in the detection of hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis, and may provide more information for diagnosis, staging and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
