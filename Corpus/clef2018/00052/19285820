Bone metastasis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer: the diagnostic role of F-18 FDG PET/CT. To evaluate the performance of F-18 FDG PET/CT in the detection of bone metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.Three hundred and sixty-two consecutive NSCLC patients who underwent F-18 FDG PET/CT scanning were retrospectively analyzed. Each image of PET/CT, combined CT, and PET was performed at 10 separate areas and interpreted blindly and separately. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of F-18 FDG PET/CT, combined CT and F-18 FDG PET were calculated and the results were statistically analyzed.Bone metastasis was confirmed in 82 patients with 331 positive segments based on the image findings and clinical follow-up. On patient-based analysis, the sensitivity of F-18 FDG PET/CT (93.9%) was significantly higher than those of combined CT (74.4%) and F-18 FDG PET (84.1%), respectively (p<0.05). The overall specificity and accuracy of combined CT, F-18 FDG PET, and F-18 FDG PET/CT were 90.7%, 93.2%, 98.9% and 87.0%, 91.2%, and 97.8%, respectively (compared with PET/CT, p<0.05). On segment-based analysis, the sensitivity of the three modalities were 79.5%, 94.3%, and 98.8%, respectively (compared with PET/CT, p<0.05). The overall specificity and accuracy of the three modalities were 87.9%, 89.2%, 98.6% and 84.5%, 91.2%, 98.7%, respectively (compared with PET/CT, p<0.05).F-18 FDG PET/CT is superior to F-18 FDG PET or combined CT in detecting bone metastasis of NSCLC patients because of the complementation of CT and PET. It is worth noting that the added value of F-18 FDG PET/CT may beneficially impact the clinical management of NSCLC.
