 Integrins are a family of cell-surface heterodimeric glycoproteins that mediate diverse biological events (e.g., cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis) involving cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions (1, 2). They consist of an α and a β subunit. They are important for cell adhesion and signal transduction. On the other hand, integrins affect tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, and metastasis (3, 4). The α
