New trends in head and neck imaging. The development of novel imaging techniques has exerted a larger influence on medical science than have any other advances in the last decade. The following occurrence are now evident in imaging for all medical disciplines: reduced use of ionizing radiation, abandonment of invasive methods, real-time properties, visualization of functional parameters, digitalization and pooling of information, as well as interaction of user with image information. A wide variety of imaging methods is now available clinically for the study of head and neck diseases. However, only picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) can efficiently handle and integrate information coming from multiple imaging modalities, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, digital subtraction angiography and digital radiography. Such systems also incorporate image workstations that the surgeon can use for preoperative planning and even perioperative assistance. Current PACS are reviewed, since their future use may change the operating theater and also change surgical strategies.
