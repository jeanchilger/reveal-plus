Neuropsychiatric effects of cocaine: SPECT measurements. Cocaine causes serious neurologic and neuropsychiatric complications. Cocaine-induced seizures are common and appear to be due to the local anaesthetic actions of this compound. Cocaine induced stroke has varied mechanisms. With ischemic stroke there is severe vasospasm induced by rises in brain catecholamines. These changes can persist for many weeks and can be demonstrated using single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). In many patients with psychiatric symptoms such as psychosis or mania, SPECT demonstrates similar changes in cerebral blood flow. In fact, some of the psychiatric symptoms induced by cocaine may be due to decreases in cerebral blood flow. In cocaine abuse, treatment strategies based on decreasing cerebral vasospasm need to be developed.
