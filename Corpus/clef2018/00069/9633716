SPECT study of a German CADASIL family: a phenotype with migraine and progressive dementia only. We describe the clinical, molecular, genetic, MRI, and SPECT features of a German family with autosomal dominant migraine and dementia, mapping to the cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) locus. We studied the correlation of cerebral blood flow, MRI, and cognitive function.CADASIL is a small-vessel disease of the brain mapped to chromosome 19p13.1. Mutations of the Notch3 gene cause this disorder. Most phenotypes are characterized by transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and lacunar strokes leading to dementia. Migraine is frequent. A single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) study of this disorder has not yet been published.We studied 13 individuals clinically and performed neuroimaging studies with MRI and SPECT.Genetic analysis strongly supported linkage to the CADASIL locus, and the disease haplotype was found in six individuals. Analysis by single-strand confirmation polymorphism did not identify Notch3 mutations. All affected individuals had MRI white matter hyperintensities and four individuals had additional basal ganglial signal abnormalities. Four affected individuals had migraine, two of whom had slowly progressive dementia. TIAs, stroke, and focal neurologic signs were absent. Cerebral blood flow reduction in SPECT studies of affected individuals matched with MRI signal abnormalities. Cognitive impairment was linked to signal abnormalities and hypoperfusion in the basal ganglia. Demented patients had a pattern of frontal, temporal, and basal ganglial hypoperfusion.We describe a CADASIL phenotype that is characterized by the absence of focal neurologic symptoms and present the first SPECT study of this disorder.
