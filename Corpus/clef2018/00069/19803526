Gold(I) analogues of a platinum-acridine antitumor agent are only moderately cytotoxic but show potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cationic gold(I) complexes containing 1-[2-(acridin-9-ylamino)ethyl]-1,3-dimethylthiourea (1), [AuL(1)](n+) (where L is Cl(-), Br(-), SCN(-), PEt(3), PPh(3), or 1), derived from a class of analogous platinum(II) antitumor agents, have been synthesized. Unlike platinum, gold does not form permanent adducts with DNA, and its complexes are 2 orders of magnitude less cytotoxic in non-small-cell lung cancer cells than the most active platinum-based agent. Instead, several gold analogues show submicromolar and selective antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
