Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging versus contrast-enhanced 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography for the detection of colorectal liver metastases. : To compare the diagnostic accuracy of gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) on a 3-T system and integrated contrast-enhanced F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CE-PET/CT) for the detection of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancers.: The approval from the institutional review board was obtained, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. We retrospectively evaluated 135 metastases in 68 patients (37 men, 31 women mean age: 68 years: The mean area under the Az on EOB-MRI versus CE-PET/CT was 0.94 versus 0.81 for all lesions (P < 0.001), 0.92 versus 0.60 for lesions ≤1 cm in size (P < 0.001), and 0.88 versus 0.96 for lesions >1 cm (P = 0.098), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive value on a patient basis were 100%, 71%, 97%, and 100% for EOB-MRI and 93%, 71%, 97%, and 57% for CE-PET/CT, respectively.: EOB-MRI using a 3-T system is more accurate than CE-PET/CT, especially for the detection of small (≤1.0 cm) lesions. Patient-based analysis revealed that EOB-MRI has a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value than CE-PET/CT.
