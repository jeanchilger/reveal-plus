Positron emission tomography with special tracers in pulmonary abnormalities. To assess the value of positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-choline (CH), (11)C-methionine (MET), (18)F-fluorothymidine (FLT), and (11)C-acetate (AC) in diagnosis of pulmonary abnormalities and the features of pulmonary abnormalities in PET.From June 2002 to June 2007, 100 patients with pulmonary nodules or masses confirmed by CT scans received PET with special tracers. Fifty-eight patients received CH-PET, 16 patients received MET-PET, 22 patients received FLT-PET, 4 patients received AC-PET. PET data was analyzed by visual method and semiquantitative method with standard uptake value (SUV). Diagnoses were compared with pathology and follow-up survey.For identification of pulmonary neoplasms with CH-PET, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 84.2% (32/38), 57.9% (11/19) and 75.4% (43/57). In cancer cases, SUV had no correlation with tumor size or age. For identification of pulmonary neoplasms with MET-PET, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 6/7, 6/9 and 75.0% (12/16). In cancer cases, SUV had not correlation with tumor size or age. For identification of pulmonary neoplasms with FLT-PET, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 85.7% (12/14), 2/8 and 63.6% (14/22). In cancer cases, SUV had not correlation with tumor size or age. In AC-PET, only 1 case of pulmonary metastasis of kidney clear cell carcinoma showed acetate avid. Two squamous cell carcinoma and 1 adenocarcinoma didn't appear abnormal in AC-PET.CH, MET, FLT, AC are valuable in diagnosing but also lead to false positive and false negative.
