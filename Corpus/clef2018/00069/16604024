Endobronchial ultrasound and PET positive mediastinal lymph nodes. In bronchial carcinoma when positron emission tomography with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) shows increased emission in the mediastinal lymph nodes, confirmation by tissue biopsy is necessary. In this particular situation we have evaluated the use of real time lymph node aspiration under endobronchial ultrasound control.Consecutive patients referred for staging and/or diagnosis of PET positive mediastinal nodes in the setting of suspected or confirmed bronchial carcinoma were included. The results of lymph node aspiration, performed under local anaesthesia in out-patients, were collected and if non-diagnostic surgical exploration was performed.20 patients were studied between December 2004 and September 2005. The average number of ultrasound guided needle aspirations per patient was 4.8 +/- 1.2. Cytological or histological confirmation of malignancy was obtained by needle biopsy in 12 patients. The 8 negative cases were confirmed by surgical biopsy. In this preliminary series the sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value of ultrasound guided aspiration of PET positive nodes was 100%.Endobronchial ultrasound with needle aspiration should be considered a primary method of investigation of PET positive mediastinal lymph nodes.
