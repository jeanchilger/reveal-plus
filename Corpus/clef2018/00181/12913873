Sequential FISH analysis of oocytes and polar bodies reveals aneuploidy mechanisms. Constitutional aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of recognised pregnancies, with apparent preferential involvement of the X chromosome and the smaller autosomes. Molecular cytogenetic investigations of cleavage-stage embryos have revealed anomalies affecting all sizes of chromosomes. The aim was to investigate the variety of anomalies arising during maternal meiosis I by analysis of unfertilised oocytes and polar bodies to gain insight into aneuploidy mechanisms.Sequential FISH analysis was carried out with specific probes derived from eight chromosomes, representing all sizes. Only imbalance due to a gain of a whole chromosome or chromatid, represented by extra signals, was counted to avoid artefact.Data were obtained on 236 eggs from 124 patients of average age 32.5 years (range 22-44). Ten patients (average 32.6 years) had abnormal eggs. The abnormality rate for oocytes and for polar bodies was close to 4% for each. Fourteen hyperploidies were found, seven involving additional single chromatids. The abnormalities affected chromosomes 13,16,18, 21 and X but not chromosomes 1, 9 or 12.The data provide evidence for several mechanisms leading to aneuploidy, including classical non-disjunction of whole univalents pre-division of chromatids prior to anaphase I, leading to imbalance detected at metaphase II
