Bilateral supratentorial epidural hematomas: a rare complication in adolescent spine surgery. A 14-year-old girl presented with a rare case of spontaneous bilateral supratentorial epidural hematomas which developed rapidly following cervical surgery. The hematomas presumably resulted from dural dynamics changes secondary to cerebrospinal fluid loss and intracranial hypotension. Intracranial epidural hemorrhage after spinal surgery is extremely uncommon with only one previous case report. Spontaneous intracranial epidural hematoma is an extremely rare complication, but should be considered as a possible complication of spine surgery, especially in adolescents complicated by delayed consciousness and breathing restoration from anesthesia. This case report expands the presently known clinical spectrum of this uncommon complication.
