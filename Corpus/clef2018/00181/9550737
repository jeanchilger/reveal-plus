Current developments in preventive health care. On the occasion of the publication of the second revised edition of the Preventiegids (Prevention guide), some recent developments in preventive health care can be analysed and priorities for the near future can be formulated. Some controversies have been resolved (e.g. periconceptional use of folic acid, influenza vaccination of all elderly), a number of others still exist (e.g. postmenopausal oestrogen substitution, screening for hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia). Further health benefit can be obtained by preventive activities, albeit to a limited extent. The focus should be on correct implementation (standardisation) of existing prevention programmes plus evaluation, with improvements where possible. There will also be opportunities for new prevention programmes (e.g. use of the triple test in screening for Down syndrome). It will be possible to discontinue existing inefficient programmes (e.g. routine pregnancy ultrasonography, routine administration of iron to pregnant women.
