Genetic counseling in balanced chromosomal inversions. The genetic counseling given at carriers of equilibrated chromosomal inversions is in relation with the type of the inversion. The risk for carriers of pericentric inversions concerning euchromatic regions depends on many factors, i.e. the length of the inserted segment in relation with the total length of the chromosome involved, the sex of the carrier and the way of assortment. In contrast, the carriers of pericentric inversions concerning the heterochromatic regions, as well as of paracentric inversions, have not a particular risk for their descendance.
