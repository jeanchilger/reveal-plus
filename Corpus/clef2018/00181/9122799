Vertebral artery occlusion associated with cervical spine trauma. A prospective analysis. Radiographs and charts of 61 patients sustaining cervical spine trauma were studied prospectively to determine the incidence of vertebral artery injuries and possible correlative factors. Statistical analysis was conducted using chi-square testing of a two-way classification system.To elucidate the incidence of vertebral artery injuries associated with cervical spine trauma, and to determine the value of various factors in predicting the existence of a vertebral artery injury.During a 7-month period, 61 patients (41 male patients, 20 female average age, 40.3 years) with cervical spine trauma were studied.All patients admitted to the authors' hospital with cervical spine injuries underwent magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of their cervical spine. All magnetic resonance angiographies were examined for vertebral artery injury. Data on demographics and the injury were recorded.Complete disruption of blood flow through the vertebral artery was demonstrated by magnetic resonance angiography in 12 of the 61 patients (19.7%). Ten of the 12 patients (83%) had either flexion distraction or flexion compression injuries. Age, sex, mechanism of injury, neurologic impairment, and associated injuries were not statistically significant in predicting the presence of a vertebral vessel occlusion.The findings in this study may support the need for vertebral vessel evaluation in selective patients, particularly those with flexion injuries and with neurologic symptoms consistent with vertebral artery insufficiency syndrome that do not correlate with the presenting bone and soft-tissue injuries.
