Abnormal maternal serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin free subunits in trisomy 18. We have measured maternal serum levels of free alpha and beta subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation in 704 women at increased risk for trisomy. This group was studied because of advanced maternal age or a previous birth with chromosomal abnormality. All sera had been collected prior to chorion villus biopsy for prenatal diagnosis. Serum levels of free alpha and beta hCG were determined by specific monoclonal antibody-based immunoradiometric assays. Analysis of chorionic tissue showed that in 38 of 704 (5.4%) pregnancies the fetus had a chromosome abnormality. There were 8 fetuses with trisomy 18 (1.1%) and 9 (1.3%) with trisomy 21. In all pregnancies carrying a trisomy 18 fetus, we observed either high levels of free alpha hCG or low levels of free beta hCG or both. More importantly, the calculated ratio of free beta hCG/alpha hCG was less than 0.25 multiples of the median (MoM) in 6 of 8 (75%) trisomy 18 cases. Only 21 of 666 mothers (3.2%) carrying a normal fetus had a ratio less than 0.25 MoM (P less than 0.0001). There was no difference between this ratio in trisomy 21 and normal pregnancy. Thus, when adjusted for gestational age, a low free beta hCG/alpha hCG ratio in maternal serum indicates a pregnancy at high risk [RR = 72 (95% CI 32, 162)] for trisomy 18.
