Ossified pseudomeningocele following Chiari decompression surgery in a patient with Kleeblattschädel deformity. The authors present the case of a 3-year-old child with Kleeblattschädel, or cloverleaf skull deformity, and a Chiari malformation Type I who developed an ossified pseudomeningocele after posterior fossa decompression. To their knowledge, this is the first report of a postoperative ossified pseudomeningocele in a patient with Kleeblattschädel and the only case of an ossified pseudomeningocele located outside the lumbosacral region. A genetic basis for the ossification process seems likely given the child's history of premature cranial suture closure. The authors draw attention to this rare complication and review the available body of literature on this topic.
