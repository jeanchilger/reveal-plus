Role of FISH on uncultured amniocytes for the diagnosis of aneuploidies in the presence of fetal anomalies. To assess the accuracy of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on amniocytes in fetuses affected by structural malformations suggestive of chromosomal anomalies.FISH of uncultured amniotic fluid cells and conventional cytogenetic analysis were performed on 48 pregnancies with ultrasonographic (US) evidence of fetal anomalies. The AneuVysion assay (Vysis) with specific probes for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y, was used. Amniotic fluid samples were obtained between the 14th and 34th weeks of gestation.In cases with a single abnormal US finding (n = 15), 5 aneuploidies were detected (1 case of trisomy 13 and 4 of trisomy 21). In the group with two or more malformations (n = 33) there were 15 aneuploidies (9 cases of trisomy 18, 2 of trisomy 21, 2 monosomy X, 1 trisomy 13, and 1 triploidy). In this group, conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed two additional chromosomal anomalies not detectable by FISH (1 trisomy 16 mosaic, and a terminal deletion 4p). No sex aneuploidies were observed.The lack of false-positive diagnosis in the FISH analysis in our sample prompts us to consider interphase FISH as a useful tool in pregnancies at high risk for chromosomal aneuploidies. When FISH analysis is normal, the overall risk of chromosomal abnormalities is significantly reduced. However, the finding of two chromosomal anomalies undetectable by AneuVysion assay confirms the need for conventional chromosome analysis to complement FISH results. Moreover, the results collected here, in agreement with those already reported in the literature, indicate that FISH analysis on uncultured amniocytes can play an important role in counselling and decision-making, especially in cases at risk for aneuploidies, such as those with structural abnormalities at US.
