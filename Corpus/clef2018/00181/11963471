Pediatric spinal injuries. Spine injuries during growth are rare, but in comparison to adults they are more often associated with neurologic impairment. They also may occur without visible injuries in X-rays. The problems of conventional radiologic diagnostics include before all the differential diagnosis between synchondrosis, apophysis and fracture lines. MRI is indicated in case of neurologic deficits without radiologic abnormalities. In principle the fracture types correspond to those seen in adults. In addition growth specific injuries of the end-plates (growth plates) or ring apophysis may occur. Stable compression fractures are treated conservatively. The spontaneous remodelling capacity for posttraumatic deformities decreases with age: in children below the age of ten years the remodelling capacity for posttraumatic kyphosis is excellent whereas deformities in the frontal plane show no or only incomplete remodelling. Unstable fractures and injuries with associated compression of neural structures should be treated conservatively.
