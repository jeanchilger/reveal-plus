Trophoblast production of a weakly bioactive human chorionic gonadotropin in trisomy 21-affected pregnancy. Total human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is high in maternal serum at 14-18 wk of trisomy 21 (T21)-affected pregnancy, despite low placental hCG synthesis. We sought an explanation for this paradox. We first observed that, in T21-affected pregnancies, maternal serum hCG levels peaked at around 10 wk and then followed the same pattern throughout pregnancy as in controls, albeit at a higher (2.2-fold) level. After delivery, hCG clearance was not significantly different from that in controls. We isolated cytotrophoblasts from 29 T21-affected placentas (12-25 wk) and 13 gestational age-matched control placentas and cultured them for 3 d. In this large series, we confirmed that, in the culture medium of trophoblasts isolated from T21 placentas, hCG secretion was significantly lower (P < 0.003) than in controls, in contrast to the high hCG in maternal serum of the same patients. In T21 cultured trophoblasts, transcripts of sialyltransferase-1 and fucosyltransferase-1 were abnormally high. In corresponding culture medium, hCG was abnormally glycosylated highly acidic [isoelectric points (pHi) = 4.5] as shown by isoelectric focusing, immunoblotting, and lectin binding
