Perforating injury of the neck and vertebral artery trauma. A 10-year-old schoolboy presented with a penetrating wound to the neck after a children's slide accident. A CT scan and endoscopy showed a traumatic oesophageal-cutaneous fistula. Neurologically the child deteriorated over a period of 34 hours and finally succumbed to a respiratory arrest. Post-mortem findings showed a hypoplastic right vertebral artery. In the left suboccipital triangle a venous clot had blocked the dominant artery thus leading to cerebellar and brainstem infarction. This extraluminal compression leading to obstruction of an otherwise non traumatized vertebral artery is unique in the literature.
