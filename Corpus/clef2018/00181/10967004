Healthy births and ongoing pregnancies obtained by preimplantation genetic diagnosis in patients with advanced maternal age and recurrent implantation failure. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and subsequent embryo development was evaluated in 72 couples presenting at our centre for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) due to severe male factor. The embryo biopsies were performed in Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-free medium. These patients were further divided into those with advanced maternal age (AMA, n = 49) and those with recurrent implantation failure (RIF, n = 23). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out on 329 blastomeres (91.3%) with probes for the X, Y, 13, 18 and 21 chromosomes. The chromosomal abnormality rate was 41.3% with no significant difference between the AMA and RIF groups. Aneuploidy accounted for the majority (72.8%) of chromosomal abnormalities. Out of 329 embryos, 84.2% had cleaved after 24 h and 15.1% had arrested. Embryos were transferred in 70 patients and 22 pregnancies were achieved (31.4% with an ongoing pregnancy rate of 28.5%). There were no significant differences between the pregnancy rates of the AMA and RIF groups (32.5 and 30% respectively). Therefore PGD should be offered to patients with AMA and RIF. Furthermore, the use of Ca(2+)/Mg(2+)-free medium during the blastomere biopsy facilitates the procedure, while further embryo cleavage, ongoing pregnancies and healthy births are possible.
