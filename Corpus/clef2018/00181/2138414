Maternal serum Down syndrome screening: unconjugated estriol is not useful. Study of 41 known Down syndrome cases and 441 matched controls did not confirm earlier reports that low unconjugated estriol levels can be used to detect fetal Down syndrome. Hence the obstetric community should exercise caution in using unconjugated estriol levels as a marker in prenatal Down syndrome screening.
