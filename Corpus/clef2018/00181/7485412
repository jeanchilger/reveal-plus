Distribution of type XV collagen transcripts in human tissue and their production by muscle cells and fibroblasts. Type XV collagen is a recently identified member of the diverse family of collagens, its structure being characterized by extensive interruptions in the collagenous sequences. A combination of Northern blot hybridization of fetal and adult human tissues and in situ hybridization analyses of a fetus with Down's syndrome, several placentas, and adult skin were used to localize expression of its mRNAs. Northern blot analysis revealed marked expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and placenta tissues and moderate levels in the kidney and pancreas. Clear in situ hybridization signals were detected in fibroblasts and endothelial cells in all tissues studied. Examination of fetal heart, skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle tissues showed that the high type XV collagen mRNA level in the muscle RNA was localized not only to fibroblasts residing in the endomysium but also to myoblasts. Interestingly, type XV collagen mRNAs were also synthesized by certain epithelial cells in kidney, lung, pancreas, and placenta. It was the morphologically immature glomeruli in the kidney and the lower parts of the nephron, especially the collecting ducts, that contained these mRNAs but not the mature glomeruli or proximal tubules, suggesting differences in expression during development. These findings indicate a wide distribution of type XV collagen transcripts, the main producers being mesenchymally derived cells, particularly muscle cells and fibroblasts.
