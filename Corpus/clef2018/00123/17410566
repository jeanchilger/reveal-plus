Calf muscle perfusion at peak exercise in peripheral arterial disease: measurement by first-pass contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. To develop a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) technique to measure skeletal muscle perfusion in peripheral arterial disease (PAD).A total of 11 patients (age = 61 +/- 11 years) with mild to moderate symptomatic PAD (ankle-brachial index [ABI] = 0.75 +/- 0.08) and 22 normals were studied using an MR-compatible ergometer. PAD and normal(max) (Nl(max) N = 11) exercised to exhaustion. Nl(low) (N = 11) exercised to the same workload achieved by PAD. At peak exercise, 0.1 mm/kg of gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) was infused at 3-4 cm(3)/second followed by a saline flush at the same rate. A dual-contrast gradient echo (GRE) sequence enabled simultaneous acquisition of muscle perfusion and arterial input function (AIF). The perfusion index (PI) was defined as the slope of the time-intensity curve (TIC) in muscle divided by the arterial TIC slope.Median workload was 120 Joules in PAD, 210 Joules in Nl(low), and 698 Joules in Nl(max) (P < 0.001 vs. Nl(low) and PAD). Median PI was 0.29 in PAD (25th and 75th percentiles [%] = 0.20, 0.40), 0.48 in Nl(low) (25th, 75th % = 0.36, 0.62 P < 0.02 vs. PAD), and 0.69 in Nl(max) (25th, 75th % = 0.5, 0.77Peak-exercise measurement of lower limb perfusion with dual-contrast, first-pass MR distinguishes PAD from normals. This method may be useful in the study of novel therapies for PAD.
