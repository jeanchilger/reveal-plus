The effect of kavinton and korglycon on the central and cerebral hemodynamics of patients with an ischemic stroke in stenoses and occlusions of the major cerebral arteries. Of the 40 patients, stenoses of major brain arteries were identified in 34, occlusions in 6, affection of two arteries in eleven patients, that of three arteries in 3 patients. The following disturbances in central hemodynamics were detected: arterial pressure getting higher, this referring also to the peripheral vascular resistance, hematocrit value, with the bloodflow in the arm-ear portion slowing down, hemodynamics being predominantly of hyperkinetic type. Treatment with cavinton, cavinton plus corglucone resulted in improvement of bloodflow in the affected major brain arteries at the expense of a compensating redistribution of bloodflow from intact collectors to the stenosed arteries basin. Changes in central hemodynamics were manifested by increase in the number of cases presenting with eukinetic-type circulation at the expense of decrease in those of hyperkinetic type. Under hypokinetic type hemodynamics, it is advisable that cavinton be prescribed in combination with cardiac glycosides.
