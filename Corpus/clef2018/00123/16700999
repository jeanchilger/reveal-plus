Research on association between atherosclerotic brain infarction and human leukocyte antigen DR gene. To evaluate the relationship between atherosclerotic brain infarction (ABI) and human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) gene at molecular level.By using polymerase chain reaction sequence specific probe (PCR-SSP), gene special position of the HLA-II DR alleles were determined in 31 patients and 30 healthy individuals as controls, all of them were inhabitants of Northeastern China.The HLA-DR B1*0301 gene frequency in the group of ABI was obviously higher than that of control group (RR=5.6842, P<0.05).The HLA-DR B1*0301 gene may be the susceptible gene of ABI in Northeastern China, or it may associate with other genes to produce the disease.
