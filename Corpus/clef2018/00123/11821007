Peripheral and central administration of neuropeptide Y in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model reduces cerebral blood flow and increases infarct volume. Recent studies have shown increased immunoreactivity for neuropeptide Y (NPY) within the perilesional cortex following experimental middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or focal excitotoxic damage. Downregulation of the NPY Y1 receptor gene using an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide produced a doubling of the infarct volume, implying that NPY may mediate neuroprotection against focal ischemia. The effects of treatment with NPY on infarct volume and hemodynamic parameters were investigated in the present study. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital to undergo right-sided endovascular MCAO for 2 h. A single dose of NPY was given via intracarotid injection (10 microg/kg) at the beginning of reperfusion, intracisternal injection (10 or 30 microg/kg) at 30 min of ischemia, or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection (10 or 70 microg/kg) at 30 min of ischemia. Control groups received the vehicle only via the same route. Body temperature was maintained constant, and hemodynamic parameters were monitored during anesthesia. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to monitor the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during ischemia and reperfusion in some rats. The rats were decapitated on day 3, and their brains were cut into 2-mm thick coronal slices before reaction with a 2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride to reveal the infarct. Compared to the respective control groups, NPY treatment via any method of administration increased the relative infarct volume. Suppression of rCBF was observed during reperfusion. These results indicate that peripheral or central administration of NPY impairs reperfusion following experimental MCAO and worsens the outcome of focal cerebral ischemia.
