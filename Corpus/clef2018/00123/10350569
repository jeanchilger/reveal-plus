Expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-2 following permanent focal ischemia and the role of nitric oxide in infarct generation in male, female and NOS-2 gene-deficient mice. Considerable evidence implicates nitric oxide (NO) in the pathological events following cerebral ischemia and, depending on the enzyme/cell source, NO is considered to be either damaging or protective. As a role for the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-2 in permanent focal ischemia is not clear, we examined its expression following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. At 24 h after occlusion, NOS-2 was expressed in cells infiltrating the infarct, while at later times, there was also expression in astrocytes around the infarct. To reveal a role for NO derived from this source, we compared infarct size in male and female mice with littermates in which the NOS-2 gene was disrupted. No differences were found between gender and genotype at 24 h. At 72 h, the infarct was increased in male mice, but not in females or in either gender with the gene disruption. These results suggest that NOS-2 plays a role in the later development of the infarct in male mice. Female mice are protected either against the damaging effects of NO, or because NOS-2 expression/activity is modulated by steroids.
