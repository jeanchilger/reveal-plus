Perioperative and early postoperative neurological deficit in older patients during carotid artery thrombendarterectomy. Cerebrovascular accidents, strokes in particular, are among the most frequent causes of death today in developed countries. In the last two decades, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death in Primorsko-Goranska Region in Croatia. In older patients, individuals older than 65 years of age have an increased risk of stroke, mainly because the degree of carotid artery stenosis increases with age. The most frequent complication of the high percent stenosis of the carotid arteries is thrombosis in the area of atherosclerotic changes of blood vessels. With the increase in the age of the population, there is also an increase in the number of risk factors of cerebrovascular accident. Doppler ultrasound sonography and Multi Slice CT scans have the most prominent role in the early detection of atherosclerotic changes and in the assessment of the degree of carotid artery narrowing. Today, in Croatia as well as worldwide, thrombendarterectomy holds the most important place in stroke prevention. Between 2006 and 2009, 209 patients underwent surgical intervention at the Clinical Hospital Center in Rijeka for high degree of carotid artery narrowing. In the group younger than 65 years of age, which consisted of 53 patients, a neurological deficit was noted in 4 patients (7.54%) in the perioperative and early postoperative course. In the group of individuals older than 65 years of age, which consisted of 156 patients, a neurological deficit was noted in 9 patients (5.76%). There was no significant statistical difference in the incidence of neurological deficit, nor in the mortality in individuals older than 65 years of age during carotid arteries thrombendarterectomy.
