Extending the vascular examination by noninvasive means. The Doppler and phleborheographic technics are highly accurate and convenient methods of diagnosing acute deep venous thrombosis, which cannot be detected reliably by clinical examination. Extent of occlusive disease can be more quantitatively estimated by the Doppler method in the peripheral arteries of the limbs and by oculoplethysmography and phonoangiography in the carotid arteries. Noninvasive methods permit screening of patients suspected of arterial or venous disease and provide physicians with an objective means of assessing therapeutic results.
