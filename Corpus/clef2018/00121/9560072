Prevalence of coronary artery disease, atherothrombotic brain infarction, and peripheral arterial disease: associated risk factors in older Hispanics in an academic hospital-based geriatrics practice. To investigate the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD), atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in older Hispanics and the association with risk factors in this population.A retrospective analysis of charts from all Hispanics seen during January 1996 through July 1997 at an academic hospital-based geriatrics practice.An academic, hospital-based, primary care geriatrics practice staffed by fellows in a geriatrics training program and by full-time faculty geriatricians.One hundred sixty women and 53 men, mean age 80 +/- 8 years (range 64 to 100), were included in the study.Of 213 Hispanics in the study, 59 (28%) had documented CAD, 43 (20%) had ABI, 34 (16%) had PAD, and 90 (42%) had either CAD, ABI, or PAD. Serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured in 202 of 213 subjects (95%). Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was measured in 137 of 213 patients (64%). Other risk factor data were documented in all patients. Multiple logistic regression analysis performed in 202 patients using the variables age, gender, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, serum total cholesterol, and serum triglycerides showed statistically significant associations between prevalent CAD, ABI, or PAD and age (P = .002, odds ratio (OR) = 1.083), cigarette smoking (P = .002, (OR) = 3.865), hypertension (P = .007, (OR) = 2.749), diabetes mellitus (P = .028, (OR) = 2.386), obesity (P = .014, (OR) = 2.608), serum total cholesterol (P < 0.001, (OR) = 1.025), and serum triglycerides (P = .017, (OR) = .993).Either CAD, ABI, or PAD was present in 42% of 213 older Hispanics. There were statistically significant associations between prevalent CAD, ABI, or PAD in older Hispanics and risk factors, including age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and serum total cholesterol.
