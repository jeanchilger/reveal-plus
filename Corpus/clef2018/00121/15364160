Association of serum apolipoprotein C III levels and apolipoprotein C III gene Sst I polymorphism with carotid intima-media thickness in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Apolipoprotein C III (apo C III) plays a central role in regulating plasma metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL). The G3238C allele (Sst I) in the 3'-untranslated region has been found to be associated with raised apo C III levels and hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). Some studies suggest that apo C III and the S(2) allele of apo C III gene are independent risk factors for atherosclerotic diseases. To study the potential association between these factors we analyzed the clinical data and their correlations with serum apo C III levels, apo C III gene Sst I polymorphism, and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in 78 unrelated Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. Apo C III gene Sst I polymorphism was examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Carotid IMT was measured by color doppler ultrasound examination. Serum apo C III levels were found to be positively associated with plasma TG ( r = 0.527, P < 0.001), TC (r = 0.424, P < 0.001), LDL-C (r = 0.308, P < 0.01) concentrations, and carotid IMT (r =0.359, P < 0.01 ). Multivariate analysis (backward) showed that diastolic blood pressure, apo C III, and fasting insulin levels were independent risk factors of carotid IMT. However, the results did not show the association between S(2) allele and carotid IMT in our diabetic patients. Thus, our study suggested that apo C III is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic diseases in Chinese type 2 diabetes.
