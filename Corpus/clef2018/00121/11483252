Transient changes of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression in hippocampus during moderate ischemia induced by chronic bilateral common carotid artery occlusions in the rat. Chronic bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) induces moderate ischemia (oligemia) in the rat forebrain in the absence of overt neuronal damage. In situ hybridization for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA was used to search for a molecular response to moderate ischemia. BDNF mRNA was significantly increased in the hippocampal granule cells at 6 h of occlusion (ANOVA, Tukey test P<0.05). At 1, 7 and 14 days BDNF mRNA levels returned to control levels. The frequency of BDNF gene expression at 6 h was 83%, which was significantly higher than the 7% incidence of histological injury in the hippocampus (Fisher's exact test, P<0.002). Cerebral blood flow was reduced to 75% of control levels in the hippocampus after 1 week of BCCAO when measured with the autoradiographic method. Measurements of tissue flow with a microprobe for laser Doppler flow excluded decreases into the ischemic range during the period when elevated gene expression was observed. Prolonged moderate ischemia (oligemia) is a sufficient stimulus for BDNF gene expression in the hippocampus. These molecular studies provide direct evidence for an involvement of the hippocampus in the BCCAO model.
