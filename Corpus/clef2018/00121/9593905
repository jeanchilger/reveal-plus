Rat middle cerebral artery occlusion by an intraluminal thread compromises collateral blood flow. We compared in Wistar rats collateral blood flow through leptomeningeal anastomoses after middle cerebral artery occlusion using craniotomy ('extravasal occlusion'), which results in a small volume of cerebral infarction, and after intraluminal thread occlusion ('intravasal occlusion'), which produces a large volume of cerebral infarction. Simultaneous laser-Doppler flowmetry with two probes placed on the cerebral cortex was used to measure and compare collateral blood flow. Extravasal occlusion caused a cortical blood flow reduction along a gradient in lateral direction, whereas blood flow reduction after intravasal occlusion was more uniformly distributed. It is concluded that permanent intravasal occlusion compromises collateral blood flow and therefore may not be a suitable model for measuring the ability of pharmacotherapeutic agents, if any, to improve collateral blood flow acutely after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The two models can be useful for testing drugs on parenchymal neuroprotective properties. Thereby, the intraluminal technique is preferred because of the possibility to study reperfusion damage when transient occlusion is applied.
