Pseudothrombophlebitis in a patient with Behçet's syndrome: Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging findings. A 33-year-old man with a known diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome (BS), presented with pseudothrombophlebitis resulting from acute rupture of a popliteal cyst. Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging findings are explained. Differentiation of rupture of a Baker's cyst from true thrombophlebitis, especially in patients with BS, who are potentially susceptible to thrombotic events, is extremely important.
