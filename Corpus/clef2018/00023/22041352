The role of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastases in patients with extrapulmonary malignancy. The determination of mediastinal lymphadenopathy is important in the management of extrapulmonary malignancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of EBUS-TBNA in the diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in patients with proven or suspicious extrapulmonary malignancy.Retrospective analysis was performed in 57 patients (81 lesions) with proven (n=51) or suspicious (n=6) extrapulmonary malignancies who underwent EBUS-TBNA between May 2009 and January 2011.There were 37 male and 20 female patients, with a median age of 64 years. Thirty-five (61.4%) patients were confirmed as malignancy (34 extrapulmonary malignancy and 1 primary lung cancer) and 22 (38.6%) patients were confirmed as benign. EBUS-TBNA identified malignancy in 30 patients. One patient who was diagnosed as primary lung cancer was excluded from diagnostic performance analysis. Overall cancer prevalence was 61% in 56 study patients. The diagnostic sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value of EBUS-TBNA per patient were 88%, 93%, and 85%. The diagnostic sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value of PET/CT scan per patient were 81%, 82%, and 71%, respectively. There were no serious complications related to EBUS-TBNA.Since mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy do not always result from metastases in patients with extrapulmonary malignancy, histopathologic confirmation is mandatory. EBUS-TBNA is a sensitive modality and can be considered as the initial test for the histopathological diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in patients with extrapulmonary malignancy.
