Systemic arterial inflammation, measured with 18FDG-PET, is common amongst subjects with both recent and prior cerebrovascular disease. To compare systemic arterial inflammation in subjects with recent ischaemic stroke or TIA and controls with prior cerebrovascular disease.Systemic arterial inflammation was prospectively measured by (18)F-fluorodeoxygluose positron emission tomography in 11 cases with recent ischaemic stroke or TIA, and 11 sex matched controls with prior cerebrovascular disease.Hot spots (both carotid and non-carotid) of localised (18)FDG uptake were found in more than half of all patients with either recent (n = 6) or prior (n = 8) cerebrovascular disease. There was no significant difference in the total number of hotspots, or hotspots at specific sites, in cases compared with controls. Mean standard uptake values (SUV) were similar in the carotid arteries and aorta of cases and controls, and showed a trend toward higher values in the femoral arteries of the controls (median 1.8 IQR 1.6-2.2) compared to cases (median 1.5Arterial inflammation was common, and appeared similar, in patients with recent stroke/TIA, and controls with stroke/TIA more than two years previously.
