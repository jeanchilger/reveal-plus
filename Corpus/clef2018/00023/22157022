The utility of two somatostatin analog radiopharmaceuticals in assessment of radiologically indeterminate pulmonary lesions. The aim of our study was to assess diagnostic accuracy of Tc-99m depreotide and Tc-99m-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy for evaluation of pulmonary lesions that appeared ambiguous on computed tomography (CT).Forty-nine consecutive patients (37 men and 12 women mean age, 60 ± 11 years) with 60 pulmonary lesions on chest radiography and CT were referred for nuclear imaging. They were prospectively allocated to undergo whole-body scintigraphy (WBS) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using either Tc-99m depreotide (26 patients, group 1) or Tc-99m-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC imaging (23 patients, group 2). Histologic findings after tissue biopsy served as a gold standard for determining diagnostic accuracy of the 2 somatostatin analogs. Visual assessment was complemented by semiquantitative analysis based on target to background ratio.Among the 32 pulmonary lesions scanned with Tc-99m depreotide, focal uptake was increased in 22 of 25 malignancies, whereas no uptake was found in 6 of 7 benign lesions (88% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and 88% accuracy) on both WBS and SPECT. Imaging of 28 pulmonary lesions with Tc-99m-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC had a similar diagnostic yield (sensitivity 87%, specificity 84%, and accuracy 86%). Overall, target to background ratios were higher on SPECT than WBS but not significantly different between groups 1 and 2 (SPECT 2.72 ± 0.70 vs. 2.71 ± 0.50, WBS 1.61 ± 0.32 vs. 1.62 ± 0.28, respectively).This study demonstrates that Tc-99m depreotide and Tc-99m-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC have similar diagnostic value for characterizing pulmonary lesions that appear ambiguous on CT.
