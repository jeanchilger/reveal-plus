Ischemic brain infarct: combined determination of regional cerebral blood flow and volume by SPECT. A combined measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (r CBF) and volume (r CBV) by SPECT was performed in 15 patients with ischaemic cerebral infarction. For measurement of r CBF 99mTc-HMPAO was used, and for r CBV 99mTc-labelled red blood cells. Patients with acute or subacute cerebral infarction (n = 10) showed elevation of r CBV whereas r CBF was either reduced or elevated. Patients with chronic cerebral infarction (n = 5) showed reduction of both r CBF and r CBV. The combined measurement of both r CBF and r CBV by SPECT allows imaging and semiquantitative evaluation of haemodynamic changes in ischaemic cerebral infarction at various stages. The resulting data may be helpful in describing the pathophysiologic compensatory mechanisms.
