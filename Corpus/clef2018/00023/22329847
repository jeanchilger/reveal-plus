¹⁸F-FDG uptake on PET could be a predictive marker of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) expression in patients with thoracic neoplasms? The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the expression level of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) and of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in various thoracic neoplasm.Three hundreds-eight patients [non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)(n=56), malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)(n=21), pulmonary metastatic tumors (PMT)(n=148), thymic epithelial tumors (n=49) and pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor (n=34)] who underwent 18F-FDG PET before treatment were included in this study. Tumors sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for ERCC1, glucose transporter 1(Glut1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) by determinate by CD34. The expression of ERCC1 in thoracic neoplasms had a positivity of 49% (152/308), and the positive rates of ERCC1 expression in NSCLC, PMT, thymic epithelial tumor, pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor and MPM were 52, 43, 53, 47 and 85%, respectively. The positivity of ERCC1 expression was significantly higher in MPM and SQC than in the other histological types. A statistically significant correlation between ERCC1 expression and 18F-FDG uptake was observed in thymic epithelial tumors, especially thymoma. Moreover, ERCC1 expression was also closely associated with the expression of Glut1, VEGF and MVD.Our results indicated that 18F-FDG uptake may be an alternative biomarker for predicting ERCC1 expression in patients with thymoma.
