Neuroimaging of traumatic brain injury. In this article, the neuroradiological evaluation of traumatic brain injury is reviewed. Different imaging strategies in the assessment of traumatic brain injury are initially discussed, and this is followed by a review of the imaging characteristics of both primary and secondary brain injuries. Computed tomography remains the modality of choice for the initial assessment of acute head injury because it is fast, widely available, and highly accurate in the detection of skull fractures and acute intracranial hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for patients with acute traumatic brain injury when the neurological findings are unexplained by computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging is also the modality of choice for the evaluation of subacute or chronic traumatic brain injury. Mild traumatic brain injury continues to be difficult to diagnose with current imaging technology. Advanced magnetic resonance techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and magnetization transfer imaging, can improve the identification of traumatic brain injury, especially in the case of mild traumatic brain injury. Further research is needed for other advanced imaging methods such as magnetic source imaging, single photon emission tomography, and positron emission tomography.
