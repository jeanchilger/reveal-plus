Contrast-enhanced FDG-PET/CT vs. SPIO-enhanced MRI vs. FDG-PET vs. CT in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer: a prospective study with intraoperative confirmation. The choice of imaging before liver surgery is debated regarding the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET). No studies have compared contrast-enhanced PET/CT with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MR imaging.To compare PET/CT with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MR imaging, PET, and CT in the detection of liver metastases (LM) and extrahepatic tumor from colorectal cancer (CRC).Thirty-five patients with suspected LM underwent PET/CT with a contrast-enhanced CT protocol and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging. Readers independently analyzed images from MR imaging, PET/CT, and the CT part and PET part of the PET/CT study. Imaging findings were compared with surgical and histological findings.Lesion-by-lesion sensitivity and accuracy for liver lesions was 54% and 77% for PET alone, 66% and 83% for PET/CT, 82% and 82% for SPIO-enhanced MR imaging, and 89% and 77% for CT alone, respectively. CT and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging were less specific but significantly more sensitive than PET (P<0.0001). For extrahepatic tumor, sensitivity and specificity was 83% and 96% for PET/CT and 58% and 87% for CT, respectively.CT and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging are more sensitive but less specific than PET in the detection of LM. PET/CT can detect more patients with extrahepatic tumor than CT alone.
