Diagnosis of liver cancer and cirrhosis by the fluorescence spectra of blood and urine. Liver cancer or hepato cellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious malady with only 10% survival rate and is fatal next only to pancreatic cancer. This disease is conventionally detected and diagnosed by ultra sound, CT or MRI scans which are quite expensive. Also the discrimination between cirrhosis and HCC, by these imaging techniques, is poor. The conventional tissue biopsy is quite invasive and painful. In the new diagnostic procedure presented in this paper we have obtained fluorescence emission spectra with excitation at 400 nm and the synchronous emission spectra (Δλ = 10 nm) for a set of blood and urine samples (Normal control N = 25, Liver Malfunction N = 58). Based on the ratio fluorometric parameters, all the three liver maladies (minor inflammation like Hepatitis C, serious diseases like Cirrhosis and hepatoma) could be detected and discriminated with an accuracy of about 80%. Hence this inexpensive, non invasive, optical technique may have significant impact in screening, diagnosis and also prognosis of HCC in large segment of people in the populous Asian countries.
