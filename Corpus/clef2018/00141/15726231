Clinical usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography with or without fine needle aspiration in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic carcinoma. The aims of this study was to show the accuracy and clinical usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer not obvious in computed tomographic (CT) scan abdomen imaging.Five male patients were evaluated 4 presented with obstructive jaundice and 1 had unexplained loss of weight. The mean age was 66 years (range, 40 to 77). All had CT scan abdomen imaging which did not show any obvious pancreatic tumour. EUS with FNA was done for all cases when indicated. Surgical findings, if any, were obtained and compared to EUS findings.EUS easily detected the pancreatic tumour in all 5 cases. The tumour sizes detected ranged from 27 to 40 mm in diameter. These corresponded fairly accurately with that of surgical findings for all 3 who had surgery. EUS reported 3 cases with pathological lymph node involvement. All 5 cases were confirmed by FNA or surgery. EUS was also accurate in 4 cases, which reported the absence of portal vein or superior mesenteric vein invasion. Surgical documentation could not verify the fifth case. There were no complications at all from the EUS with/without FNA.This case series showed that EUS with/without FNA appears to be useful and safe in diagnosing and staging pancreatic head tumours not detectable by CT scanning.
