High-resolution MRI of pancreatic masses with a new circularly polarized body phased-array coil. A total of 18 patients with clinical suspicion of a pancreatic tumor underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT and MRI examinations. A fat-suppressed T1-weighted 2D fast-low-angle-shot (FLASH) sequence and a T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequence were applied in a transverse orientation using a circularly polarized (CP) body phased-array coil. The FLASH sequence was repeated after Gd-DTPA administration. The highest spatial resolution was 1.37 x 1.37 x 3.00 mm3. In two cases a half Fourier single-shot turbo-SE sequence (HASTE) was additionally applied. In a comparison between CT and MRI, pancreatic masses could be demonstrated and characterized with excellent image quality. The fat-saturated 2D FLASH sequence yielded the highest contrast-to-noise ratios after Gd-DTPA administration between pancreas and inflammatory or neoplastic lesion. One non-contour deforming carcinoma could be detected only with MRI and was only retrospectively visible on CT with an element of uncertainty. Magnetic resonance imaging using a CP body phased-array coil and fat-suppressed T1- and T2-weighted FLASH, SE, and turbo-SE sequences offers diagnostic possibilities in improved imaging of the pancreas.
