Body computed tomography findings in systemic lupus erythematosus. Fifty-five computed tomography scans in 27 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were reviewed. The most frequent indication for scanning was suspected intraabdominal sepsis, and the most frequent finding was mild lymphadenopathy. Renal abnormalities were: subcapsular hematoma, focal defects, overall enlargement, and diminution of size. Other findings included serositis, bowel wall thickening with pneumatosis intestinalis, pancreatic pseudocyst, and hepatic and splenic enlargement. Five abscesses were found that were indistinguishable from other fluid collections. Computed tomography was helpful in clinical evaluation and in some cases changed management.
