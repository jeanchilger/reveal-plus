Intense Ga-67 uptake in adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas. Gallium-67 citrate (Ga-67) scintigraphy was performed in a patient with adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas. Intense and homogeneous uptake was observed in the tumor. Few reports have dealt with Ga-67 findings in pancreatic cancers. Ga-67 uptake in the tumor was assumed to be due to accumulation in the component of squamous cell carcinoma. This case suggested that Ga-67 citrate scintigraphy may be useful in detecting adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas. To our knowledge, no report has described findings of Ga-67 citrate scintigraphy of adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas. Radiologists should remember adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas when encountering such scintigraphic findings.
