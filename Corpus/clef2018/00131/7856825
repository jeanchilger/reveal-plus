Specific and nonspecific responses to Plasmodium falciparum blood-stage parasites and observations on the gametocytemia in schoolchildren living in a malaria-endemic area of Mozambique. We have observed specific and nonspecific reactivities to the asexual states and gametocytes of Plasmodium falciparum and examined the effect of chloroquine and Fansidar (pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine) on the dynamics of gametocytemia. Schoolchildren peripheral blood films positive for P. falciparum gametocytes were identified in a malaria-endemic area of Mozambique. The children were randomly allocated into two groups to receive chloroquine or pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine, and were followed for 28 days after treatment. In patients harboring drug-sensitive parasites, asexual parasitemias were cleared by day 4, but gametocytes persisted for an additional 17 days. The prevalence of the asexual parasites was 67.6% in the chloroquine-treated group at day 0 and 61.1% at day 28, whereas in the pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine treated group, the initial parasite prevalence of 70.7% was reduced to 2.4% at day 28, suggesting a high prevalence of chloroquine-resistant parasites. On day 0, gametocyte prevalence was 59.5% in the chloroquine-treated group and in 68.3% in the pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine-treated group these values were reduced to 5.6% and 2.4%, respectively, at day 28. Our results suggest strongly that there is no induction of gametocytogenesis by either course of chemotherapy.
