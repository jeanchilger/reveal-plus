Recent advances in visualization, imaging, and navigation in hepatobiliary and pancreatic sciences. Recent introduction of multi-detector CT (MDCT) and high-speed magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have dramatically advanced visualization and imaging technology in diagnostic and therapeutic strategy in hepatobiliary pancreatic disease. However, image diagnostics have progressed with a background of the essence of anatomy, pathology, and physiology. It is important to object the reflection of the patient's condition and pathology of each disease and remove pattern recognition in what they were depicted as an image. Visualization plays another important role in various medical diagnostics. Trends in scientific visualization will depend on advancements in molecular technology and computer hardware as well as trends in engineering disciplines.In this special issue, the recent advances in visualization and imaging in the field of hepatobiliary and pancreatic sciences are featured including application of advanced visualization techniques, data management, data compression, feature extraction.We discuss the potential benefits of new technologies and procedures in hepatobiliary and pancreatic areas, that are circulating tumor cells, MR imaging for hepatocellular carcinoma, indocyanine green using fluorescence under infrared light observation, carbon dioxide enhanced MDCT virtual cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biliary drainage, natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery, MR-laparoscopy, and image overlay navigation surgery by OsiriX.Some of the recent trends are discussed in terms of visualization and imaging in hepatobiliary and pancreatic sciences. The goal in using visualization is to assist existing scientific procedures by providing new insight through visual representation.
