Diagnosis of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Expanding drug-resistance of P. falciparum strains is one of the main problems of the control and treatment of malignant tropical malaria. The World Health Organisation recommends the in vivo test as well as macro and micro in vitro tests for the epidemiological and clinical diagnosis. The authors describe the methodology of these tests, which helped them to identify the first chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains from Moçambique and Angola as well as one fansidar-resistant strain from Angola.
