von Hippel-Lindau disease: MRI of abdominal manifestations. The cranial and spinal manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease are well known. Less attention has been given to the varied abdominal manifestations. We present a pictorial review of the cystic and solid tumours involving the kidneys, pancreas and adrenal glands as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. We highlight the advantages of this non-ionizing technique in the assessment of this young group of patients with a protracted screening future.
