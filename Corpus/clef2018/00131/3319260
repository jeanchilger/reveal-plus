Current aspects of imported drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. 24 cases of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a group of 73 non-immune subjects coming mostly from central Africa have been tested in vitro for chloroquine sensitivity: 5 are sensitive, 19 are resistant among whom one is also quinine-resistant. The comparison of the major clinical and biological features in the two groups by methods of statistical calculation shows that the parasitological diagnosis is retarded and that hemolysis is more frequent in the strains of Plasmodium falciparum resistant to chloroquine. Thrombopenia is more frequent with chemosensitives strains. In any case, the delay between the first symptoms and the parasitological diagnosis is increased with an average of 17 days in comparison to what was observed in the 1970's. Under the influence of several complex factors including human ones, the clinical aspects are changed in comparison to forms usually observed. In this context of an extension of the emergence of the chemoresistance and in the aim of efficiency, only the quinine I.V., with an average dose of 16.5 mg/kg per day of quinine-base, has been chosen as a curative treatment during 5 days allowing a rapid recovery without after-effects for all the cases.
