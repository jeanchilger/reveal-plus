Guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis. Antimicrobials are frequently used to prevent infections. Principles of prophylaxis, and antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery, tuberculosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, influenza A, traveller's diarrhoea, malaria, recurrent otitis media, Haemophilus influenzae type b infection, pertussis, rheumatic fever, and urinary tract infection are described. Various strategies to improve the prophylactic use of antibiotics are discussed. Collaborative efforts among health care disciplines are needed to assure optimal antimicrobial prophylaxis. This should maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects, the development of bacterial resistance and associated costs.
