Role of endoscopic ultrasound in evaluation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors--report of 22 cases from a tertiary center in Iran. The pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) is relatively rare and generally felt to follow an indolent course. EUS has an important role in detection of pNET. This is a review of clinical and radiological presentation and pathologic reports of 22 patients with pNET.In this study we analyzed clinical and radiological presentations and pathologic reports of all relevant cases who were referred to Taleghani hospital for 3 years since 2008.A total of 22 patients 28-74 years old (mean=49) were enrolled between 2008 and 2011. Among the total, 13 (59%) were male, 9 (41%) were female and 16 (72.7%) had functional tumors. The results of CT were negative in 12 (54%) cases but EUS was capable of detecting the lesions in these patients, cysts being found in 4 (19%) patients.EUS is a highly sensitive procedure for the localization of functional pNETs and especially insulinomas. Nonfunctional tumors were detected in more advanced and late stages and cystic lesions were more common in this group.
