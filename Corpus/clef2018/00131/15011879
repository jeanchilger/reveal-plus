Inferior head resection of the pancreas for noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous adenocarcinoma. We report inferior head resection of the pancreas for noninvasive intraductal papillary mucinous cancer. A 77-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of epigastric pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a multilocular cystic tumor 3.5 cm in diameter in the head of the pancreas. We performed inferior head resection of the pancreas with partial resection of the duct of Santorini. The duodenum, the common bile duct, and most of the duct of Santorini were preserved. He is presently alive and well without any evidence of recurrent disease 49 months after the operation. Partial pancreatic resection has the advantage of preserving pancreatic parenchyma. Inferior head resection of the pancreas would play an important role in surgical management of low-grade malignant neoplasm.
