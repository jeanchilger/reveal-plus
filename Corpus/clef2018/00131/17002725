Malaria control using indoor residual spraying and larvivorous fish: a case study in Betul, central India. To assess the impact of intensified malaria control interventions in an ethnic minority community in Betul using existing tools.Two rounds of indoor residual spraying with synthetic pyrethroid insecticide were applied and larvivorous fish introduced, followed by intensive surveillance for early detection of Plasmodium falciparum with rapid diagnostic tests and prompt treatment with sulphadoxine pyrimethamine.Pre-intervention surveys revealed a very high fever rate in the community in all age groups with a slide positivity rate of >50% with >90%P. falciparum. The post-intervention phase showed a sharp steady decline in number of malaria cases (beta 0.972 P < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.35-0.47). Monitoring of entomological results revealed a significant decline in both Anopheles species and An. culicifacies (P < 0.0001).A combination of indoor residual spraying and early detection and prompt treatment complemented by rapid diagnostic tests and larvivorous fishes successfully brought malaria under control. These approaches could be applied in other regions of different endemicity to control malaria in India.
