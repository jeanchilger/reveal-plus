Malaria associated anaemia, drug resistance and antimalarial combination therapy. Malaria associated anaemia represents a major cause of childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Prevention of severe anaemia necessitates rapid treatment of symptomatic high density parasitaemia, as well as reduction of asymptomatic parasite prevalence to provide recovery period to restore production of erythrocytes. Both interventions are being increasingly impaired by reduced efficacy of antimalarial treatment due to parasite drug resistance. A new treatment strategy, including combinations of antimalarial drugs with optimal pharmacodynamic and kinetic properties may respond to the need of rapid and radical parasite clearance, temporary protection to re-infection, and prevention of drug resistance.
