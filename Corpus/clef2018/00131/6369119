Complement activation by the surface of Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes. The surface of trophozoite-stage Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes will, in the presence of immune human or owl monkey serum, activate the classical complement pathway. This was demonstrated with a sensitive, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which detects the complex, C1s-C1 inhibitor, which is only generated when the classical pathway is activated. A second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as well as Covaspheres coated with affinity-purified anti-C3, showed that immune activation of the classical pathway by infected erythrocytes resulted in the accumulation of significant amounts of C3b on the erythrocyte surface. During the development of the parasite to the trophozoite stage, the erythrocyte membrane is also transformed from a non-activator into a surface capable of activating complement by the alternative pathway. Erythrocytes infected with trophozoite-stage parasites directly activated the alternative complement pathway. This activation led to the specific binding of an average of 15,000 C3b molecules per infected cell. Alternative pathway activation was augmented by anti-parasite antibody. Such conditions mediated the accumulation of an average of 36,000 C3b molecules per infected erythrocyte. The amounts of C3b on the infected erythrocyte surface did not lead to cellular lysis. They are, however, likely to have a major impact on the total in vivo response to this parasite.
