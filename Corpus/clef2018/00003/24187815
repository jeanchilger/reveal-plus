Incidence of endometrial cancer in patients with biopsy specimens of endometrial hyperplasia. According to the Histopathological Registry of Malignant Neoplasms in Mexico, endometrial cancer ranks third gynecological cancers after cervical cancer and ovarian cancer. In 2003 represented 2.16% of all female cancers and in 2007 was the cause of 2.8% of hospital discharges nationwide cancer.To determine the possibility of coincidence of endometrial cancer in biopsy specimens of patients with endometrial hyperplasia.We analyzed patients who underwent hysterectomy for hyperplasia preoperative biopsy between January 2007 and October 2008.We found 86 patients with biopsy specimens of hyperplasia who underwent hysterectomy, hyperplasia was confirmed in 70 (group A) and endometrioid endometrial cancer reported in 16 (group B). We found cancer in 2 of 61 patients with simple hyperplasia without atypia (3.2%), none of the 6 patients with atypical hyperplasia was found simple cAncer (0%) and 19 patients with complex hyperplasia with atypia was documented EC 14 (73.68%). Patients in group B are older vs 51.3 44.4 years, have a lower number of pregnancies 2.6 vs 3.1 and have a higher body mass index 34.71 vs 29.05 than group A.The percentage of agreement between complex endometrial hyperplasiaand endometrial cancer is the highest reported in the literature. Endometrial biopsy in our hospital has low sensitivity for predicting coexistence between complex endometrial hyperplasia and CE. Patients with endometrial biopsy complex endometrial hyperplasia associated with BMI greater than 30 and age over 50 years are at high risk for having coexistence with endometrial cancer. For the high frequency of coexistence with cancer, patients with preoperative biopsy complex endometrial hyperplasia should undergo hysterectomy with frozen section of the uterus to avoid reoperation in case of malignancy.
