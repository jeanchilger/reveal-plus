Expression of phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) in endometrioid cancer and lymph nodes metastases. We identify the expression of PRL-3 in primary endometrioid endometrial cancer and metastases in relation to the clinicopathological characteristics.The study involved 30 patients with type I endometrial cancer. Twelve of them were diagnosed with metastases in various localization of abdomen. The PRL-3 expression was evaluated on the basis of immunohistochemistry results by the use of monoclonal antibody anti-PRL3 clone 3B6.The intensity of PRL-3 expression in correlation with tumor stage was statistically significant (p = 0.024). The strongest reaction was noted in cases classified as a 1a and 1b stage defined by FIGO. The strength of PRL-3 expression is significantly associated with the degree of histological tumor grade (p = 0.035).The strong expression of PRL-3 in the primary tumor that was significantly correlated with the grade and clinical stage suggest that PTP4A3 participates in the process of endometrial carcinogenesis.
