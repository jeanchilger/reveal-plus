Efficient gene therapy based targeting system for the treatment of inoperable tumors. A considerable percentage of tumors are not amenable to surgery. We have designed a simple and powerful targeting system that offers an alternative option for the multi-component pre-targeting strategies used clinically. This targeting system can be used for any type of solid tumors independent of the tumor type, thereby omitting the need to engineer unique antibodies for each specific application or tumour type. In the present study, we show the expression of a chimeric fusion protein, which contains the low-density lipoprotein receptor transmembrane domains and avidin, after local gene transfer and its ability to bind biotinylated compounds in vivo.Semliki Forest virus and lentivirus vectors were used to express the fusion protein with a high affinity binding site for biotinylated compounds in the tumor. Three different animal models and imaging modalities were used for the demonstration of the functionality and efficacy of the targeting system in vitro and in vivo.We demonstrate targeting of biotinylated compounds after local gene transfer in vivo using two different gene transfer vectors. The findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, single-photon emission computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The therapeutic efficacy was tested in a syngeneic rat glioma model by injecting biotinylated-(90) Yttrium into the tail vein of glioma bearing rats. The study demonstrates that animals, which were treated by using the gene therapy based targeting system, lived significantly longer than control animals.Our gene therapy based targeting system is a promising tool for the treatment of inoperable tumors and other disease conditions, as well as diagnostic imaging.
