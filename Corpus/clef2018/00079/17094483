Effect of 2-deoxy-D-glucose on various malignant cell lines in vitro. 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is an analog of glucose that is preferentially captured by tumors and is accumulated in transformed cells, because the phosphorylated molecule (2-DG-6P) cannot be metabolized or diffused outside the cells. Targeted with a fluorine atom, 18F-DG is currently used to visualize malignant tumors (PET scan). Although cancer cells have been reported to be strongly dependent on glycolysis (Warburg effect), very few reports have studied the inhibitory effects of 2-DG on cancer.Our objective was to study, in a large panel of human malignant cells of various origins (ovarian, squamous, cerebral, hepatic, colonic and mesothelial), if the inhibitory activity of 2DG against tumor growth could be considered a general phenomenon and to determine its effect on the cell cycle.Four types of response in the different cell lines were observed when cells were cultured in the presence of 2-DG (5 mM) continuous exposure: proliferation slow down proliferation arrest without signs of apoptosis2-DG appears as an interesting new therapeutic agent against cancer in vitro, and should be tested in in vivo studies.
