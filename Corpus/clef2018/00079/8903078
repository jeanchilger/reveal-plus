Feasibility of SPECT for studies of brain perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography were used to assess brain perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass. Intravenous injections of technetium 99 m-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (99mTc-HMPAO) were administered before surgery and intraoperatively after the first 2 minutes in the first patient and at the end (42 minutes) of cardiopulmonary bypass in the second patient. The total middle cerebral artery territory counts were calculated using the region-of-interest method and compared to cerebellar regional counts. 99mTc-HMPAO uptake on SPECT scans was increased at the beginning and at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, compared to baseline preoperative values (11-17%) in the presence of multiple microembolic signals on TCD (n1 = 35 and n2 = 42 for unilateral middle cerebral artery monitoring). These results indicate the feasibility of using HMPAO-SPECT to study brain perfusion changes during cardiac surgery. A combination of SPECT and TCD ultrasonography may be used to study the impact of microembolism during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
