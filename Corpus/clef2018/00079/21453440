Association of incompleteness of the anterior part of the circle of Willis with the occurrence of lacunes in the basal ganglia. This study investigated whether incompleteness of the anterior part of the circle of Willis affects the occurrence of lacunes in the basal ganglia.One thousand and seventy-seven healthy individuals examined by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR angiography were divided into eight subgroups according to our new classification.Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that healthy individuals with incompleteness of the anterior circle of Willis had significantly higher frequency of lacunes [odds ratio (OR): 2.121, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.477-3.108 or OR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.377-4.384 in cases without or with fetal type posterior communicating artery, respectively] and higher numbers of lacunes (P < 0.001 or P < 0.001 in cases without or with fetal type posterior communicating artery, respectively) compared to patients with complete circle of Willis.Incompleteness of the anterior part of the circle of Willis significantly affected the occurrence of lacunes.
