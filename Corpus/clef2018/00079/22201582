The clinical significance and management of lesion motion due to respiration during PET/CT scanning. Lesion movement during positron emission tomography (PET) scan acquisition due to normal respiration is a common source of artefact. A PET scan is acquired in multiple couch positions of between 2 and 5 min duration with the patient breathing freely. A PET-avid lesion will become blurred if affected by respiratory motion, an effect similar to that created when a person moves in a photograph. This motion also frequently causes misregistration between the PET and computed tomography (CT) scan acquired for attenuation correction and anatomical correlation on hybrid scanners. The compounding effects of blurring and misregistration in whole-body PET/CT imaging make accurate characterization of PET-avid disease in areas of high respiratory motion challenging. There is also increasing interest in using PET quantitatively to assess disease response in both clinical reporting and trials. However, at this stage, no response criteria take the effect of respiratory motion into account when calculating the standardized uptake value on a PET scan. A number of different approaches have been described in the literature to address the issue of respiratory motion in PET/CT scanning. This review details the clinical significance of lesion movement due to respiration and discusses various imaging techniques that have been investigated to manage the effects of respiratory motion in PET/CT scanning.
