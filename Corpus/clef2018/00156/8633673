Conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is followed by disappearance of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid and a decline in serum and cervical mucus antibodies against human papillomavirus antigens. Our purpose was to investigate whether conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia eliminates human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid and effects the levels of serum and cervical mucus antibodies against human papillomavirus antigens.Analysis of paired cervical brush and serum samples taken from 23 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia before and 16 to 27 months after conization was performed for presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction and for human papillomavirus antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Four women had recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, whereas 19 women were disease free. Eighteen of 23 women were positive for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid before treatment. At follow-up only the 4 women with recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were positive. Serum immunoglobulin G levels and A levels and immunoglobulin A levels in cervical mucus against most of the tested human papillomavirus antigens had declined at follow-up.Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was regularly eliminated and human papillomavirus antibody levels, especially local immunoglobulin A, declined after efficient treatment, suggesting that conization may be effective for treating the underlying human papillomavirus infection.
