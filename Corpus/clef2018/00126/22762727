Fasting apolipoprotein B48 is associated with asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease in type 2 diabetic subjects: a case-control study. To test whether there is an association between fasting ApoB48 level, a marker of the residual presence of intestinally derived TRLs lipoproteins, thought to be highly atherogenic, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in type 2 diabetic patients independent of fasting plasma lipids.We studied 87 patients with type 2 diabetes: 34 with asymptomatic PAD (ankle/brachial index < 0.9) and 53 without PAD matched on age (±2 years), gender and BMI (±2 kg/m(2)). The plasma fasting ApoB48 was measured by ELISA.Patients with PAD had significantly higher ApoB48 levels (1.529 ± 1.253 vs 1.095 ± 0.667 μg/ml p = 0.04) than those without PAD independent of major confounders, such as duration of diabetes, smoking status, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and fasting plasma lipids.Fasting ApoB48 was independently associated with asymptomatic PAD in patients with type 2 diabetes.
