Hyponatremic hypertensive syndrome in an obese man with renal ischemia. Renovascular hypertension occasionally manifests as an electrolyte disorder. The combination of hyponatremia and renovascular hypertension is known as hyponatremic-hypertensive syndrome. This syndrome was initially reported in children. Here, we describe a 45 year-old Saudi man who was admitted to the hospital with generalized body weakness and inability to walk. He was confused and was noted to have severe hypertension and very low serum sodium and potassium. The patient was recently started on captopril for blood pressure control, which was discontinued because of deterioration of renal function. Color Doppler renal ultrasound, and magnetic resonance angiography confirmed the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.
