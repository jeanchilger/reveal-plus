Diagnosis of intracranial arterial stenosis using transcranial Doppler flowmetry. In this case report we describe the use of transcranial Doppler flowmetry during induction of anesthesia in a patient with a large pituitary tumor. In this patient, both IV anesthesia induction and onset hyperventilation were followed by severe decreases of flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery of the affected side. Transcranial Doppler detected critical blood flow reduction in response to anesthesia induction and onset of hyperventilation in a brain tumor patient.
