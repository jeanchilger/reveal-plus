Application of autoregressive analysis to 20 MHz pulsed Doppler data in real time. The real time application of autoregressive (AR) spectral analysis to a 20-MHz pulsed Doppler blood flowmeter is presented. The system consists of a TMS 320C25 digital signal processor with a 80286 based PC/AT microcomputer and associated interfacing circuitry. The AR method was used for in vivo spectral analysis of the signals obtained from a 20-MHz pulsed Doppler flowmeter in real time. The data obtained from digital and coronary arteries were processed using both AR and FFT spectral analysis methods. Also the data obtained from a stenosis coronary artery under surgical operation were processed using both methods. When the results are compared, it is seen that autoregressive analysis has given better results. Therefore the technique can be used in the examining of small vessels such as renal, iliac, mesenteric, coronary and digital arteries.
