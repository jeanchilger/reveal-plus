Precervical myositis ossificans in an infant secondary to child abuse. We present a 10-week-old girl with myositis ossificans circumscripta (MO) of the neck secondary to nonaccidental trauma. This condition is rarely seen in infants furthermore, the majority of MO lesions develop in the extremities rather than the head and neck region. We will detail the US-guided biopsy technique used in our case, in addition to discussing the characteristic imaging and pathological findings of MO to assist in the diagnosis and successful treatment of this condition.
