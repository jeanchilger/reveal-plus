Spinal injury: optimising the imaging options. There have been numerous documented attempts in formulating risk-based guidelines for the exclusion of spinal injury using conventional radiography. Although the advent of computed tomography (CT) (including spiral and multi-slice) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the known limitations of conventional radiography, there is still a requirement to define optional use of these modalities in a trauma setting. This chapter addresses these issues by reviewing the literature and provides a synopsis of the current thinking in the appropriate sections (adult, paediatric, symptomatic, asymptomatic, etc.) in the quest of finding out the correct answers on how best to exclude/confirm spinal trauma.
