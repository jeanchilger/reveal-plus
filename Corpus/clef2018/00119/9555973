Spreading depression induces depletion of MAP2 in area CA3 of the hippocampus in a rat unilateral carotid artery occlusion model. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces neuronal cell loss in area CA3 of the hippocampus. However, it has not yet been established why traumatic injury of the cortex induces neuronal damage in more remote areas. Spreading depression (SD) may be one potential mechanism for this pathophysiology. The present study evaluated whether SD on the cortex evokes a pathological change in the hippocampus. Forty-two Fisher rats were assigned to four groups: Group I: sham operation (n = 7), Group II: right carotid occlusion (UO) for 7 days (n = 7), Group III: repeated induction of SD by KCl application on dura for 7 days (n = 7), Group III' for 3 h (n = 7), Group IV: SD induction and UO for 7 days (n = 14) Group IV' for 3 h (n = 7). In 5 out of 7 animals in Groups III' and IV', cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored using laser Doppler flowmetry for 3 h during the passage of SD. The brains were processed for immunohistochemical analysis of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). Reactive hyperemia induced by SD was not significantly suppressed by right carotid occlusion (194 +/- 25% and 181 +/- 42% UO in Groups III and IV, respectively). In 6 out of 7 animals in a 7-day model of Group IV, and 3 animals in a 7-day model of Group III, MAP2 depletion in the CA3 area of the hippocampus (partly including CA2) was observed, although no change in the hippocampus was observed in other groups. In conclusion, SD in combination with UO yielded reproducible lesions in CA3. Neuronal injury in the hippocampus after brain trauma may be attributable to SD in combination with the blood flow restriction.
