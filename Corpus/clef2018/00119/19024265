Atherosclerotic changes on head and neck blood vessels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of atherosclerotic plaque of head and neck blood vessels and to determine the dynamics of circulation through the brain blood vessels in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In 35 patients with SLE aged 37.67+/-9.96 and whose disease lasted 3.8+/-4.51 years, Doppler carotid ultrasonography was used to identify the presence of intima-media thickness or atherosclerotic plaque. Brain perfusion scintigraphy was done in 15 out of 35 patients in order to evaluate the dynamics in circulation through carotid and cerebral media arteries. Measured by Doppler ultrasound, 2/35 of examined lupus patients had a plaque and the 2/35 had an intimal-medial thickness. The results of perfusion scintigraphy in 15 examined patients out 35 with SLE showed that 5/15 had mild circulatory changes in carotidogram. 4/15 patients had mild changes in cerebra media arteries circulation, 1/15 had severe changes in carotid circulation and 5/15 patients had normal brain scintigraphy finding. Some of the patients with SLE have atherosclerotic changes and only the early detection of atherosclerosis may provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention.
