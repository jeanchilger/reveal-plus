Colour Doppler flow imaging of the carotid arteries. 53 patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis were examined by colour Doppler flow imaging. These results were compared with real time duplex sonography and continuous wave Doppler sonography. In 48 low degree stenoses (less than 50%) the B-mode showed 36 smooth and 12 ulcerated plaque surfaces. In 24 high degree stenoses (greater than 50%) 10 plaques were smooth and 14 ulcerated. In the low degree stenoses, which exhibited smooth surfaces in B-mode examination, colour flow Doppler showed nine additional cases with turbulences in the area of the stenotic site. This indicates that plaque ulcerations in low degree stenoses are underestimated. In contrast, in nearly all cases with high degree stenoses marked turbulences could be demonstrated by colour Doppler flow imaging independent of the B-mode, showing regular or ulcerated plaque surfaces. Additionally, the duplex ultrasound diagnosed a carotid artery occlusion in 11 cases, but the colour coded Doppler was able to assess a remaining blood flow in two out of these 11 cases. Our results suggest that the colour Doppler flow imaging as a noninvasive technique is an advantage in diagnosing plaque ulcerations and it is more precise in diagnosing carotid occlusions than duplex-sonography is.
