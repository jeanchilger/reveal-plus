Acute treatment with rosuvastatin protects insulin resistant (C57BL/6J ob/ob) mice against transient cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of rosuvastatin (RSV), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on transient, focal cerebral ischemia in C57BL/6J ob/ob mice with insulin resistance (IR). Male ob/ob, lean, or wild-type (WT) mice were treated with RSV (10 mg/kg per day, i.p.) or vehicle for 3 days. Ischemia was induced by 60 mins of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and cortical blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Infarct volumes were measured 24 h after reperfusion. IR mice exhibited a higher infarct volume compared with Lean or WT mice, and RSV reduced infarct volume only in obese mice (40%+/-3% versus 32%+/-3%, P<0.05). Blood cholesterol and insulin levels were elevated in ob/ob mice but were unaffected by RSV. The CBF reductions during MCAO were similar in all groups and were not affected by RSV. Although RSV did not increase cortical endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels in the ob/ob mice, it attenuated the increased cortical expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) after MCAO from ob/ob mice. Thus, RSV protects against stroke in IR mice by a mechanism independent of effects on the lipid profile, CBF, or eNOS but dependent on suppression of post-MCAO ICAM-1 expression.
