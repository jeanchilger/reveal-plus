The connexin 37 (1019C>T) gene polymorphism is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in women with type 1 and 2 diabetes and in women with central obesity. The gene for connexin 37 (Cx37) is considered to be one of the candidate genes for cardiovascular disease. We evaluated the association between Cx37 (1019C>T) gene polymorphism (Pro319Ser) and ankle brachial blood pressure index (ABI) in women with type 1 (n=178) and type 2 (n=111) diabetes, and in women from general population (n=862). All women were genotyped for Cx37 polymorphism. In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, ABI was analyzed. In women with type 1 diabetes, ABI significantly decreased from TT to CC carriers (p for trend = 0.008). A similar trend was seen in women with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.050) and in women with waist circumference above 75th percentile (94 cm n=208) of the general population (p = 0.049). The gene for Cx37 was associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in women with type 1 and 2 diabetes and in women with advanced central obesity. The presence of C allele indicated increased risk.
