Recent advances in the sonographic assessment of vascularity and blood flow in gynecologic conditions. This overview presents recent advances in sonographic depiction of vascularity and blood flow in the uterus, ovaries, and breasts. Enhanced sonographic visualization and evaluation of intraorgan vascularity has resulted from improved image processing and display. Future advances, such as the use of contrast enhancement, are also mentioned in this overview as one of many topics for future investigation.This is an overview of the topic based on review of the literature and the authors' experience.Specifically, the sensitivity of color Doppler sonography has been enhanced with the use of amplitude or power Doppler techniques. Spatial depiction of vascularity has improved because of 3-dimensional and "live 3-dimensional" processing.The combination of more sensitive color Doppler sonography and 3-dimensional imaging provides both anatomic and physiologic assessment of the vascularity and blood flow of the ovary, uterus, and breast.
