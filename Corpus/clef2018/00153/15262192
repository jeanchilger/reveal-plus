Intima-media thickness of elastic and muscular arteries of young women with polycystic ovaries. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) occurs in around 10% women of reproductive age and is characterised by obesity, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance and adverse lipid profile. This suggests that these women may be at an increased risk of coronary artery disease at a young age. The objective of this study was to measure the intima-media thickness (IMT) in the carotid bulb (CB), common carotid (CCA) and common femoral (CFA) arteries in young women aged less than 35 years.A total of 43 age-matched women were recruited 19 symptomatic women with PCOS, 12 asymptomatic women with polycystic ovaries (PCO) and 12 staff volunteers with normal ovaries on transvaginal scan. All subjects were examined with ultrasound wall tracking system for IMT measurements. Their age, body mass index, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting endocrine and biochemical parameters were also measured.The IMT measurements were significantly higher in both the CFA and the CCA in young women with PCOS compared with controls (CFA, 0.74 +/- 0.30 mm versus 0.42 +/- 0.078 mm, P < 0.001 and CCA, 0.54 +/- 0.11 mm versus 0.40 +/- 0.01 mm, respectively, P < 0.006). After adjustment for known risk factors, the IMT in both the femoral and carotid arteries remained highly significant.The results of this study suggest that PCOS affects femoral and carotid wall mechanics leading to premature sub-clinical atherosclerosis in young women with PCOS and may lead to the development of new strategies for screening.
