Streptococcus fryi sp. nov., a novel species with Lancefield group M antigens. The taxonomic characteristics of β-hemolytic streptococcal strains that reacted with Lancefield group M antisera were investigated. Group M streptococci have not been proposed as a species to date. Four strains of the group M streptococci isolated from dog were located within the pyogenic group of the genus Streptococcus on 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis the group M strains were located a short distance away from all other members of the group. The homology values of 16S rRNA gene sequences between group M strains and all other streptococci were<95.6%. Group M strains exhibited low levels of DNA-DNA homology to other streptococcal species. Some biochemical traits, such as β-galactosidase activity and acid production from glycogen, could distinguish these group M strains from other closely related species. Thus, these strains are proposed to constitute a new species -Streptococcus fryi sp. nov. The type strain is PAGU 653(T) (=NCTC 10235(T)=JCM 16387(T)).
