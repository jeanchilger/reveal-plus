Why type streptococci? The epidemiology of group A streptococci in Oxfordshire 1976-1980. The results of typing all group A streptococci isolated in one laboratory in 5 years were reviewed to see if the collected information showed epidemiological patterns. The great majority of the 5858 streptococci typed came from patients seen in general practice: 72% from throat swabs and 11% from skin lesions. Eight types, M types 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 22 and type 28 R accounted for 65% of strains. These eight types had different patterns: types 2 and 6 caused small circumscribed outbreaks and were uncommon between epidemics types 3, 4 and 12 caused larger, wider epidemics, whereas types 1, 22 and 28 R had a more stable pattern. Type 4 was more commonly resistant to tetracycline than most other types, a finding which affected the apparent incidence of tetracycline resistance in group A streptococci. Streptococci from superficial sites were more likely to have serum opacity factor and to lack a detectable M-antigen than strains isolated from the throat. Routine typing of streptococci helped to detect outbreaks of infection in special groups. It is concluded that regular streptococcal typing should be continued in some places.
