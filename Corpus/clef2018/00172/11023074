Development of EIA for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in genital specimens. A double antibody sandwich enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for chlamydial antigen detection was developed using a monoclonal antibody against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Chlamydia trachomatis as a coating antibody. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against partially purified antigen from elementary body (EB) antibody and horse-radish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody were used as the primary and secondary antibody respectively. The developed EIA could detect protein of partially purified EB at the lowest concentration of 250 ng/ml. The assay was evaluated against the cell culture (CC), DNA hybridization assay (PACE2 system: Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA) and a commercial enzyme immunoassay (kEIA) (Bioquest, NSW, Australia). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the developed EIA (dEIA) were 87, 96.2, 80, 97.7 for the specimens from females and 90.9, 90.7, 71.4, 97.5 for the specimens from males repectively. Cross reaction was not found with Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter anitratus, beta-Streptococcus group A, Enterobacter spp, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus spp, Neisseria spp, but it was found with Candida albicans and herpes simplex virus type 1. The developed EIA can be applied successfully for both genders, particularly males. The cost per test is less than those for CC, kEIA and PACE2.
