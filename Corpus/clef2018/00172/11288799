Immunopathological diagnosis of cicatricial pemphigoid with desquamative gingivitis. A case report. Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a chronic subepidermal bullous dermatosis which primarily involves the mucous membranes. The oral cavity and the eye are most frequently involved. Since extension of the lesion into the pharynx and esophagus causes sore throat and dysphagia and progressive ocular lesions may cause blindness, early and valid diagnosis is very important. Here we present a case of cicatricial pemphigoid with onset at age 45 in a patient who manifested severe periodontal disease and showed the lesion on the mucous membranes of the mouth (desquamative gingivitis), skin, and eyes. Since definite diagnosis is very important, we describe how we made a differential diagnosis from other diseases which also accompany desquamative gingivitis. We examined the clinical manifestations, blood test results, HLA-genotype, histopathologic findings of the affected tissue, and immunological findings in relation to autoimmunity. Since many of the CP cases are first referred to periodontists or dentists, we believe that the diagnostic strategy described in the present study will be quite informative for making rapid and definite diagnoses of similar cases.
