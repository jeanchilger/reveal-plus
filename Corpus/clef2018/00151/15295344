Laparoscopic removal of endometriomas: sonographic evaluation of residual functioning ovarian tissue. The aim of this study was to determine whether and to what extent laparoscopic removal of ovarian endometriotic cysts is a tissue-sparing procedure.At the University Hospital, 77 women of reproductive age with endometriomas and 55 with dermoid cysts underwent laparoscopic removal of the ovarian disease by stripping. Within 1 month before and within 36 months after surgery all patients underwent transvaginal sonographic evaluation of ovarian volume of the endometriomas or dermoid cysts and measurement of the residual ovarian tissue.The residual ovarian volume after surgery was significantly less for the endometrioma group than for the dermoid group. Comparison of the volume of the treated ovary with that of the untreated contralateral ovary showed a significant difference (4.3+/-2.3 cm(3) vs 9.7+/-3.9 cm(3)) only in the endometrioma group.Ovarian stripping of endometriomas, but not of ovarian dermoids, is associated with a significant decrease in residual ovarian volume which may result in diminished ovarian reserve and function.
