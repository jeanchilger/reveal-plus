Uterine artery embolization for symptomatic fibroids with imaging follow up. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of uterine artery embolization (UAE) as a primary treatment method in treatment of symptomatic fibroids, whether there are any preembolization MRI characteristics of fibroid predictive of reduction in volume and assess reduction in uterine and dominant fibroid volumes using ultrasound (US) and MRI. Study was carried out in total of 32 patients aged 25-49 years (mean 40.9 years). Uterine and dominant fibroid volume were determined using US and MRI before UAE, MRI and US at 3 months and US alone at 6 and 12 months post-UAE, supplemented by clinical evaluation at interval of 3, 6 and 12 months. Procedure was carried out through unilateral femoral puncture using poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) particles 355-500 microm in size. All 32 patients had successful procedures. Overall, 25 patients responded, giving a clinical success rate of 78.12%. Mean reduction in volume of uterus and fibroid was 33 and 59.7% and 48.9 and 75.5% on US at 3 and 12 months respectively, and 33.3 and 58.6% on MRI at 3 months. Volume reduction on US and MRI at 3 months was highly correlative. There was no statistical difference in size reduction in volume of fibroids, which were hypointense or hyperintense on T2-weighted image (T2WI) on pre-UAE MRI. Uterine artery embolization leads to good technical success and fibroid volume reduction. Ultrasound alone may be used for follow up of patients post-UAE. Preprocedure signal characteristics on T2WI are not predictors of volume reduction after UAE.
