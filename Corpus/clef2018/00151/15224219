Occlusion of the external cervical os after conization in a postpuerperal amenorrheic woman. Complete occlusion of the cervical canal following conization is an uncommon complication.We encountered a case in a woman with lactation amenorrhea who after conization to treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 developed hematometra and did not resume menstruation. This case was diagnosed early by ultrasonic tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Postpuerperal amenorrheic women should be managed with care because of the increased risk of occlusion of the cervical duct after conization.
