Urachal duct carcinoma complicating pregnancy. Degenerating myomas are common explanations for pain associated with abdominal masses in pregnancy. However, masses arising from other pelvic organs should be included in the differential diagnosis.We present a case of an abdominal mass in pregnancy that was originally misdiagnosed as a uterine leiomyoma. Attention to the patient's history along with judicious use of imaging modalities led to the correct diagnosis of urachal duct carcinoma. This was treated appropriately and resulted in a term vaginal delivery. We present a review of the literature on this tumor and its management in pregnancy.Urologic malignancies are rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any woman presenting with pain and an abdominal mass in pregnancy. A multidisciplinary approach optimizes outcomes.
