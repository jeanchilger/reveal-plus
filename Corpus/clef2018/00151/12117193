Imaging of cancer of the endometrium. Transvaginal US is often the initial imaging examination for women with dysfunctional (postmenopausal or intermenstrual) uterine bleeding. However, once the diagnosis of endometrial cancer has been made, contrast-enhanced MRI should be performed in patients who require multifactorial assessment (eg, depth of myometrial invasion, cervical involvement, lymph node metastasis). The results of contrast-enhanced MRI help distinguish patients who need more aggressive therapy and referral to a gynecologic oncologist from those who will do well treated by a community gynecologist.
