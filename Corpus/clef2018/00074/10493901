FMRI and PET of self-paced finger movement: comparison of intersubject stereotaxic averaged data. We compared the intersubject-averaged functional anatomy of self-paced right index finger movement as revealed by (15)O water positron emission tomography (PET) and blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) at 1.5 T. Image data sets were acquired with both techniques on a group of eight subjects, spatially normalized in the stereotaxic space and subsequently processed in order to get identical smoothness and degrees of freedom. Intersubject-averaged PET and FMRI activation maps were found congruent in the left primary sensorimotor area (PSM), bilateral supplementary motor area, bilateral supra marginalis gyri, left operculum, left inferior parietal lobule, right middle frontal gyrus, and right cerebellum. In those regions the mean distance between PET and FMRI local maxima was 7.4 mm. FMRI detected additional activations in the right precentral gyrus, right rolandic operculum, right inferior parietal lobule, and bilateral insula, whereas PET demonstrated a higher detection sensitivity at the deep nuclei level. PET and FMRI percentage signal variations were found linearly related by a factor around 10, both within the PSM and across a set of distributed local extrema. However, in most cases, FMRI was more sensitive than PET, as assessed by t values. Finally the pattern of deactivations was markedly dissimilar between the two techniques, possibly due to differences in the "Rest" control task.
