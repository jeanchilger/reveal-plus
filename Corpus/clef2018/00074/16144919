Detection and staging of preinvasive lesions and occult lung cancer in the central airways with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography: a pilot study. To evaluate the role of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in radiologically occult preinvasive lesions and lung cancer in the central airways.Twenty-two patients with 24 preinvasive lesions and early squamous cell cancer (SCC) being occult on high-resolution computed tomography were studied. All lesions were diagnosed based on histology sampled using autofluorescence bronchoscopy. FDG-PET findings were correlated with WHO histologic classification. FDG-PET was considered true-positive when the final diagnosis was SCC and true-negative when the lesions were classified as severe dysplasia or less.FDG-PET was true-positive in 8 of 11 and true-negative in 11 of 13 cases corresponding with a sensitivity of 73% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43-0.91] and specificity of 85% (95% CI, 0.57-0.97). Positive and negative predictive values were 80% (95% CI, 0.48-0.96) and 79% (95% CI, 0.52-0.93), respectively.Our very preliminary data suggest that FDG-PET might be useful for the evaluation of early central airway lesions, being positive in most SCC and negative in cases of severe dysplasia. Validation in a larger multicenter study is needed.
