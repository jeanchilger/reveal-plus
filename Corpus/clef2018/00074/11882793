Gadobenate dimeglumine in MRI of acute myocardial infarction: results of a phase III study comparing dynamic and delayed contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging with EKG, (201)Tl SPECT, and echocardiography. To evaluate the safety and utility of gadobenate dimeglumine as a magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI).One hundred three patients with acute MI received intravenous bolus gadobenate dimeglumine (0.05 mmol/kg) during MR examination. Dynamic and delayed T1-weighted spin-echo postcontrast images were compared with precontrast images, EKG, resting (201)Tl SPECT and echocardiography.Gadobenate dimeglumine was well tolerated. Dynamic imaging with gadobenate dimeglumine was more sensitive (72% vs 56%) than delayed spin echo imaging (P < 0.001). No difference in specificity was seen (98% vs 99%). (201)Tl SPECT was a sensitive (96%) test, but was not specific (63%). Echocardiography was not sensitive (32%), but was specific (92%).The intravenous use of gadobenate dimeglumine, at a bolus dose of 0.05 mmol/kg, is safe in patients with an acute MI. Dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging has moderate sensitivity and high specificity for demonstrating infarct.
