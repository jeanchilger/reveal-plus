Pancreatic imaging. New modalities. This article discusses the techniques and applications of the newest pancreatic cross-sectional imaging modalities. The specific modalities that are discussed include helical computed tomography with dual phase imaging and three-dimensional computer rendering techniques, magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic and intraductal pancreatic sonography, and radionuclide scintigraphy using positron emission scanning and somatostatin-receptor imaging.
