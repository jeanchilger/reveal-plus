Contribution of biomarkers and imaging in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent malignant tumour of the liver. HCC prognosis is dependent on the determination of the tumour stage by conventional imaging and early screening. However, patient survival can vary with the same tumour stage. Biomarkers thus have a role in providing an earlier diagnosis, better prognosis classification before treatment and classification prognosis during treatment. In this review article, we will provide a successive, detailed description of the serum, pathological, molecular and imaging markers of HCC.
