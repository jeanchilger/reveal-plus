Iatrogenic atrial septal defect and aortoatrial fistula in a patient with endovascular prosthesis in the inferior vena cava. Percutaneous procedures and endovascular prostheses are becoming increasingly frequent, replacing classic interventions, and new complications are now appearing. We report the case of a liver transplant patient with a stenosis in the anastomosis of the suprahepatic veins to inferior vena cava, treated by self-expanding prosthesis, who developed an aorto-right atrial fistula and an atrial septal defect. Open heart surgery was performed to correct the defects. Transthoracic echocardiogram 1 year later revealed no evidence of residual shunt.
