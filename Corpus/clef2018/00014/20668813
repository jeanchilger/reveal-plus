Porphyria cutanea tarda, hemosiderosis and hepatocellular carcinoma: report of one case. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a hereditary or acquired disease. It can be unleashed by iron overload, alcohol, estrogens and other conditions. In these patients, hepatic involvement can be associated to cirrhosis, iron overload or C and B viral infections, that are predisposing factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a 69-year-old man with PTC, hemosiderosis and hepatocarcinoma. The tumor was diagnosed during a routine ultrasound examination for early detection of malignant lesions. The patient was subjected to a right hepatic excision. The pathological examination of the surgical piece confirmed the diagnosis and disclosed free surgical margins. After 18 months of follow up, the patient had a relapse and a liver transplantation was performed.
