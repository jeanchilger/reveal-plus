Small liver nodule detection with a high-frequency transducer in patients with chronic liver disease: report of 3 cases. We report 3 cases in which small liver lesions were revealed on sonography with the supplemental use of a high-frequency transducer. In all 3 cases, the patients had cirrhosis or chronic liver disease. The lesions were not seen on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Sonography plays a pivotal role in surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma and, with modern transducer technology, may be the first imaging modality to show an early small tumor. A more thorough search for focal liver lesions with adjunctive use of high-frequency transducers may prolong the examination time but can improve surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma.
