Hepatocellular carcinoma. HCC is the fifth most common tumor worldwide and the third cause of cancer-related deaths. The incidence of HCC is increasing. HCC has become the leading cause of death in patients with liver cirrhosis. Surveillance of patients with chronic liver disease allows early detection of HCC. Surgical resection, liver transplantation and ablative therapies can cure early stage HCC. HCC of intermediate and advanced stage can be treated by chemoembolisation and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, respectively, leading to improved survival. This review summarizes the recent diagnostic and therapeutic developments in the field of HCC.
