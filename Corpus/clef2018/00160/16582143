ACOG Committee Opinion. Evaluation and management of abnormal cervical cytology and histology in the adolescent. Number 330, April 2006. The management of abnormal cervical cytology in adolescents differs from that for the adult population in many cases. Certain characteristics of adolescents may warrant special management considerations. It is important to avoid aggressive management of benign lesions in adolescents because most cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 1 and 2 regress. Surgical excision or destruction of cervical tissue in a nulliparous adolescent may be detrimental to future fertility and cervical competency. Care should be given to minimize destruction of normal cervical tissue whenever possible. A compliant, health-conscious adolescent may be adequately served with observation in many situations.
