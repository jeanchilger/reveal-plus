Developments in treatment of primary irresectable rectal cancer. Abstract The treatment options for primary irresectable rectal cancers are discussed. Assessment of tumour stage is the first step for an appropriate choice of treatment. Following a diagnosis of rectal cancer, a vast array of diagnostic procedures is available to determine its stage, and thereby its best treatment options. From the many (new) diagnostic options the merits and drawbacks are discussed. If a diagnosis of irresectability is made, further treatment options should include radiotherapy in most cases, some aspects of timing and application, i.e. intra-operative treatment are discussed. Chemotherapy options are manifold, the results are discussed and some new options are explored.
