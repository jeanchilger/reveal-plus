Is diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging superior to positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 in imaging non-small cell lung cancer? This retrospective analysis examined whether diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging might be as useful as positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 for (1) discriminating between non-small cell lung cancer and benign pulmonary nodules and (2) predicting aggressiveness of non-small cell lung cancer.Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were performed before surgery in 110 patients with 124 pulmonary nodules smaller than 3 cm, including 96 non-small cell lung cancers and 28 benign nodules. Diffusion of water molecules in magnetic resonance imaging was measured by minimum value of apparent diffusion coefficient. The criterion standard was the result of histologic diagnosis or follow-up examination. Sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between cancers and benign nodules were compared between diffusion-weighted imaging and positron emission tomography. Apparent diffusion coefficient in diffusion-weighted imaging and fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in positron emission tomography were examined with respect to pathologic tumor stage lymphatic, vascular and pleural involvementsThere were no significant differences between diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in sensitivity or specificity for non-small cell lung cancer. Whereas positron emission tomography showed significant differences in fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake between pathologic stages IA versus IB or more advanced stages between tumors with and without lymphatic, vascular, or pleural involvementDiffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is equivalent to positron emission tomography in distinguishing non-small cell lung cancer from benign pulmonary nodules but is not as useful for predicting aggressiveness of non-small cell lung cancer.
