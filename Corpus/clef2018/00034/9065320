The use of SPECT in a multidisciplinary memory clinic. We tested the interobserver reliability of visual rating of HMPAO-SPECT imaging in 271 outpatients referred to a memory clinic, and followed over 1 year. The clinical diagnoses were Alzheimer's disease (n = 156), frontotemporal dementia (n = 47) vascular dementia (n = 21), senile dementia of Lewy body type (n = 12), anxiety/depressive disorders (n = 14) and miscellaneous memory disorders (n = 21). The interobserver agreement was good (k = 0.68). However, the heterogeneity of the patterns-independent from demographic data, age at onset and duration of the disease- and their lack of sensibility and specificity limited the contribution of SPECT for diagnostic purposes in routine practice.
