Cortical blood flow during cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: three-dimensional N-isopropyl-p-[(123)I]iodoamphetamine single photon emission CT findings. The relationship between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and angiographic vasospasm and the value of rCBF in predicting vasospasm and the prognosis are not fully delineated. Our aim was to investigate the changes in extent of vasospasm-induced decreased cortical rCBF on three-dimensional (3D) displays of single photon emission CT (SPECT) findings. The clinical usefulness of these assessments was analyzed.In 58 cases of SAH, SPECT and digital subtraction angiography were performed on the same day, 5-9 days after SAH or within 24 hours after the onset of delayed ischemic neurologic deficit (DIND). Cerebral blood flow data were assessed by measuring the area of decreased cortical rCBF on 3D SPECT images.The area of decreased cortical rCBF on the 3D images was significantly increased in cases with DIND (P <.001), in cases with a large infarction due to vasospasm (P =.006), and in cases with a poor prognosis after vasospasm (P =.045). These increases were also related to the type of angiographic vasospasm the greatest decrease in cortical rCBF occurred in the combined type (combination of the peripheral and proximal types) of vasospasm, followed by cases with the peripheral type, proximal type, and no angiographic vasospasm. In cases with DIND, patchy decreased cortical rCBF areas were seen before the onset of DIND.Combined-type vasospasm leads to reductions in CBF greater than those due to isolated peripheral or proximal vasospasm. Two-dimensional and mean-hemispheric CBF analyses are less sensitive for this change than is 3D SPECT.
