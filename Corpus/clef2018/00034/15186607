Clinical usefulness of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy in oncological diagnostics: a pilot study. The clinical usefulness of a new 99mTc-labeled somatostatin analogue has been studied from the standpoint of oncological diagnostics. The group of patients studied included 40 individuals with diagnosed malignant neoplasms (32 primary and 8 metastatic). Among the primary tumors were 7 pituitary adenomas (5 hormonally active and 2 inactive), 1 liposarcoma, 2 carcinoids, 1 breast carcinoma, and 21 cases of lung cancer (2 small cell and 19 non-small cell) were represented. The metastatic tumors consisted of: 3 malignant melanomas, 1 pheochromocytoma, 1 prostatic cancer, 1 leiomyosarcoma, 1 pancreatic carcinoma ectopically secreting ACTH, and 1 carcinoid of the thymus. The radiopharmaceutical, 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-octreotide, was i.v. administered at the activity of 740-925 MBq. The imaging was comprized of a whole-body scan and single photon emission computed tomography. Positive scintigrams were obtained in 4 of 5 hormonally active pituitary adenomas, in 1 of 2 cases of carcinoid, in liposarcoma, breast cancer, and all cases of small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The neoplastic metastases were visualized in 2 of 3 cases of melanoma and in patients with pheochromocytoma, pancreatic carcinoma secreting ACTH, and thymic carcinoid. Scintigrams were negative in both hormonally inactive pituitary adenomas, in one case of metastatic malignant melanoma, leiomyosarcoma, and in cases of metastasis from the prostatic carcinomas. The results of this pilot study indicated that 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC is a potentially useful radiopharmaceutical for the imaging of a wide range of primary and metastatic tumors. More detailed indications for the clinical usefulness of the new tracer for the imaging of selected tumor types require studies on much larger groups of patients. Special attention should be paid to the successful imaging of all cases of NSCLC.
