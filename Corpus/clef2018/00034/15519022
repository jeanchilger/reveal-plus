Functional significance of stenoses in coronary artery bypass grafts. Evaluation by single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion imaging, cardiovascular magnetic resonance, and angiography. This study was designed to perform a head-to-head comparison between single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to evaluate hemodynamic significance of angiographic findings in bypass grafts.The hemodynamic significance of a bypass graft stenosis may not always accurately be determined from the coronary angiogram. A variety of diagnostic tests (invasive or noninvasive) can further characterize the hemodynamic consequence of a lesion.Fifty-seven arterial and vein grafts in 25 patients were evaluated by angiography, SPECT perfusion imaging, and coronary flow velocity reserve determination by CMR. Based on angiography and SPECT, four different groups could be identified: 1) no significant stenosis (<50%), normal perfusion 2) significant stenosis (>/=50%), abnormal perfusionA complete evaluation was obtained in 46 grafts. Single-photon emission computed tomography and CMR provided similar information in 37 of 46 grafts (80%), illustrating good agreement (kappa = 0.61, p < 0.001). Eight grafts perfused a territory with scar tissue. When agreement between SPECT and CMR was restricted to grafts without scar tissue, it improved to 84% (kappa = 0.68). Integration of angiography with SPECT categorized 14 lesions in group 1, 23 in group 2, 6 in group 3, and 3 in group 4. Single-photon emission computed tomography and CMR agreement per group was 86%, 78%, 100%, and 33%, respectively.Head-to-head comparison showed good agreement between SPECT and CMR for functional evaluation of bypass grafts. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance may offer an alternative method to SPECT for functional characterization of angiographic lesions.
