A reproducible model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice: hemodynamic, biochemical, and magnetic resonance imaging. A reproducible model of thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was established in C57 Black/6J mice by matching the diameter of the thread to the weight of the animals. For this purpose, threads of different diameter (80 to 260 microns) were inserted into the MCA of animals of different weights (18 to 33 g), and the success of vascular occlusion was evaluated by imaging the ischemic territory on serial brain sections with carbon black. Successful occlusion of the MCA resulted in a linear relationship between body weight and thread diameter (r = 0.46, P < 0.01), allowing precise selection of the appropriate thread size. Laser-Doppler measurements of CBF, neurological scoring, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining confirmed that matching of animal weight and suture diameter produced consistent cerebral infarction. Three hours after MCA occlusion, imaging of ATP, tissue pH, and cerebral protein synthesis allowed differentiation between the central infarct core, in which ATP was depleted, and a peripheral penumbra with reduced protein synthesis and tissue acidosis but preserved ATP content. Perfusion deficits and ischemic tissue alterations could also be detected by perfusion- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, demonstrating the feasibility of dynamic evaluations of infarct evolution. The use of multiparametric imaging techniques in this improved MCA occlusion model opens the way for advanced pathophysiological studies of stroke in gene-manipulated animals.
