Embolic brain infarction: a rare complication of thoracic outlet syndrome. A report of two cases. The thoracic outlet syndrome is known to cause brachial neuropathy. Pressure on the subclavian artery causing post-stenotic dilatation with intraluminal thrombosis is not a common complication. This may lead to antegrade embolisation and ischemic changes in the upper limb. In right sided thoracic outlet syndrome the thrombus may extend retrogradely. From this an embolus may detach to the right hemisphere of the brain resulting in left sided hemiplegia. This is a rare but serious complication from a neglected, relatively benign, curable condition. This report describes two cases of a right sided thoracic outlet syndrome due to cervical rib compression with retrograde embolisation.
