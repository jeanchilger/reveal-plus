EEG burst suppression is not necessary for maximum barbiturate protection in transient focal cerebral ischemia in the rat. Barbiturates have been demonstrated to reduce the cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) in a dose-dependent manner but investigations of a dose-response relationship for their neuroprotective efficacy are scant. It has been suggested that barbiturates possess other mechanism of action that may be critical to their protective effect. If so, it is conceivable that the peak effect of such mechanisms does not parallel the reduction in CMR. Thus, maximal neuroprotection may be achieved with a substantially lower dose of the drug. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion while either anesthetized with (1) halothane (control) or (2) intravenous thiopental titrated to cause mild EEG suppression or (3) thiopental titrated to maintain EEG burst suppression. Cortical blood flow was recorded by continuous bilateral laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Infarct volume was assessed after 3 h of reperfusion. Low-dose thiopental decreased blood flow to 80% of baseline and high-dose thiopental to 70% of baseline. LDF did not indicate improvement of blood flow by thiopental in the ischemic area. Compared to controls, low-dose thiopental significantly decreased infarct volume by 28% and high-dose thiopental by 29%. The results of this study and a review of literature indicate that barbiturates provide cerebral protection but that the magnitude of this effect has been overestimated. Other mechanisms than CMR reduction seem to contribute to their beneficial effects, and high doses administered to the point of burst suppression may not be required to obtain maximal protection.
