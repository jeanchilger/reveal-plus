Effect of suture size and carotid clip application upon blood flow and infarct volume after permanent and temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Problems with the intraluminal suture method for induction of focal cerebral ischemia in genetically altered mice include occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and variability of infarct volume. We hypothesized that use of 5-0 curved or 6-0 straight suture for carotid cannulation might decrease SAH and that the application of a microvascular clip to the common carotid artery (CCA) might decrease variability of infarct volume. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and explain the results of these technical modifications. Strain related differences in vascular anatomy were evaluated. Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into two groups for permanent and temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Results of 5-0 curved suture and 6-0 straight suture insertion with and without CCA clip application were examined. Cerebral perfusion was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry and infarct volume was measured. After permanent MCAO, larger and more consistent infarct volumes resulted using CCA clip application with a 6-0 but not with a 5-0 suture. After temporary MCAO, the SAH rate was 12.5% with a 5-0 curved suture and 11.1% with a 6-0 straight suture. A 40% rate was observed in a pilot study with 5-0 straight suture. Infarct volume after temporary MCAO with a CCA clip was significantly larger and variability of infarct volume was smaller than without the CCA clip using 5-0 curved and 6-0 straight suture. In summary, SAH is less frequent using a 5-0 curved or 6-0 straight suture. Infarct volume is enlarged by application of a CCA clip (249).
