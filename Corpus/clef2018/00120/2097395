Indications for cerebral revascularization through the system of the external carotid artery. The paper analyzes the study into the specific features of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with internal carotid artery occlusion. The study was performed by using Doppler ultrasound techniques. It revealed three different types of collateral blood flow of the brain according to the function of orbital anastomosis. The authors propose a new unique assessment of indications for a reconstructive operation on the external carotid artery for brain revascularization. The criteria proposed by the authors for assessing the cerebral hemodynamics enable the clear-cut indications for the above operation to be defined. The paper also summarizes the experience in examining and surgically managing 38 patients with internal carotid artery occlusion, who underwent revascularization of 39 channels of the external carotid artery.
