Persistant carotido-hypoglossal artery associated with atherosclerotic stenosis treated by venous bypass. A 66 year-old woman presented with a tight but asymptomatic atheromatous stenosis in a persistant carotido-hypoglossal artery. Stenosis was documented by ultrasound Doppler tomography whereas the embryologic anomaly was disclosed by digital angiography. A successful venous bypass was done. Based on this case report, the diagnostic and therapeutic problems raised by such anomalies are discussed.
