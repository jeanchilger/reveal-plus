Arterial stiffness and progressive neurological deficit in patients with acute deep subcortical infarction. The mechanism of progressive neurological deficit (PND) in patients with ischemic stroke remains unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify whether arterial stiffness, a marker of vascular endothelial impairment and arteriosclerosis, is associated with PND in patients with acute deep subcortical infarction.We evaluated 156 consecutive first-ever ischemic stroke patients with acute deep subcortical infarction. PND was defined as an increment of ≥2 points in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score or an increase of ≥1 point in the limb weakness score within 7 days of stroke onset. Patients were assessed for risk factors, and infarct size was measured on initial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. We measured brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) as a marker of arterial stiffness. We divided patients into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of PND to compare their clinical characteristics.Fifty-two patients (33%) had PND, and baPWV was significantly higher in patients with than in those without PND. The baPWV cut-off value for PND was 18.24 m/s, with 90% sensitivity and 47% specificity. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, high baPWV (≥18.24 m/s odds ratio, 8.22Arterial stiffness indicated by baPWV is independently associated with PND in patients with acute deep subcortical infarction.
