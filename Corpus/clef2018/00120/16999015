New features in the recommendations of the Second Hungarian Therapeutic Consensus Conference. The First Hungarian Therapeutic Consensus Conference took place on 3rd Nov. 2003 with the participation of 9 medical societies. Over the past 2 years the results of new major studies have been published and the American ATP III has also updated its guidelines issued in 2004. Based on the above proposals, the Second Hungarian Therapeutic Consensus Conference held on 3rd Nov. 2005 partly confirmed its earlier suggestions, but made some changes as well. Within the high risk category the Conference optionally created a very high risk group from those patients who - in addition to their cardiovascular disease--have either diabetes or metabolic syndrome or acut coronaria syndrome or who are chain smokers. We have included - as a complement - into the asymptomatic high risk category such newly emerging risk factors, one of which already in itself means high risk: ankle/arm index < or = 0.9, GFR <60 ml/min, microalbuminuria (30-300 mg), preclinical atherosclerosis (plaque). Besides, 4 other risk factors were also categorised such as Lp/a (> or = 30 mg/dl), CRP (> or = 3mg/l), homocysteine (> or = 12 micromol), familiarity--atherogenic gene constellation, but only the presence of at least two of these verify high risk. In very high risk group the goals of 3.5 mmol/l and 1.8 mmol/l were determined as therapeutic option. The goal in obese patients--expressed earlier only in BMI--can now be equally determined by the abdominal circumference (94 cm for men, 80 cm for women respectively). ACE inhibitors were recommended earlier as a preventive therapy in case of dysfunction of the left ventricle, while at present they are suggested for all patients with cardiovascular disease. In the recent recommendations guidelines related to nutrition, smoking, exercise have also been included.
