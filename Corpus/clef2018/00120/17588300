Candesartan cilexetil--a review of effects on cardiovascular complications in hypertension and chronic heart failure. Therapeutic interventions that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have an important role in slowing the progression of cardiovascular risk actors to established cardiovascular diseases. In recent years, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have emerged as effective and well-tolerated alternatives to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) for RAAS blockade. The ARB candesartan was initially established as an effective once-daily antihypertensive treatment, providing 24-h blood pressure (BP) control with a trough:peak ratio close to 100%.A Medline literature search was undertaken to identify randomised, controlled trials that examined the efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes associated with candesartan cilexetil in hypertension and chronic heart failure (CHF).Compared with other ARBs, candesartan demonstrates the strongest binding affinity to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Clinical trials have demonstrated that candesartan is well tolerated in combination with diuretics or calcium channel blockers (CCBs), making it a suitable treatment option for patients whose hypertension is not adequately controlled by monotherapy. Subsequently, candesartan became the only ARB licensed in the UK to treat patients with CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% as add-on therapy to an ACEi or when an ACEi is not tolerated. Studies in patients with symptomatic HF have indicated that candesartan treatment was associated with significant relative risk reductions in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation due to CHF.There are clear indications that the clinical benefits of candesartan may extend beyond its proven antihypertensive effects to a wider range of complications across the cardiovascular continuum, including diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerosis and stroke. Such results suggest that candesartan treatment may offer significant patient benefits as well as practical advantages over conventional treatment.
