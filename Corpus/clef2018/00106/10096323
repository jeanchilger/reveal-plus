Thoracopancreatic fistula: clinical and imaging findings. The goal of this work was to describe the clinical and imaging features of thoracopancreatic fistula, a rare complication of pancreatitis.Nine cases of thoracopancreatic fistula proved by thoracentesis, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or surgery were retrospectively and independently reviewed by two abdominal radiologists. All available imaging examinations [chest radiographs = 9, CT = 9, MR and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) = 2, and ERCP = 6] were analyzed, and findings were recorded on a standardized datasheet. Available medical records (n = 7) were reviewed to determine the clinical presentation of the patients and thoracentesis results.Seven of the nine patients presented with pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea or cough. Of the seven patients with pleural fluid analysis, all demonstrated elevated amylase levels (mean 13,007 U/L). Imaging examinations revealed pancreaticopleural fistulas in six patients, a mediastinal pseudocyst in one patient, and both a pancreaticopleural fistula and a mediastinal pseudocyst in two patients. Chest radiography showed pleural fluid collections in eight patients. CT demonstrated a fluid-containing fistula in all nine patients. MR and MRCP depicted a fistula extending from the abdomen to the pleural space in the two patients with MR correlation. ERCP showed pancreatic ductal changes characteristic of chronic pancreatitis in the six patients with ERCP correlation but failed to demonstrate the fistula in two of the six patients.The CT, MR, MRCP, or ERCP finding of a fluid-filled tract extending from the pancreas to the thorax is characteristic of a thoracopancreatic fistula, particularly when identified in a patient who presents with pulmonary symptoms and a history of chronic pancreatitis.
