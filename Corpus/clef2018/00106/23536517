The protective effects of taurine on experimental acute pancreatitis in a rat model. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of taurine (Tau) on experimental acute pancreatitis (AP) in a rat model by measuring cytokines and oxidant stress markers. Forty rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham, AP, Tau and AP + Tau. AP was induced with sodium taurocholate. No treatment was given to the AP. All rats were killed 5 days later. Pancreatic tissues of rats and blood samples were obtained. Tau treatment significantly decreased serum amylase activity (p < 0.001), total injury score (p < 0.001), malondialdehyde levels (p < 0.001) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the Tau and AP + Tau groups in serum and pancreatic tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 levels (p = 1.000). Histopathologic scores in the AP + Tau and Tau groups were significantly lower compared with the AP group (both p < 0.001). These results showed that Tau reduces lipid peroxidation, amylase and MPO activities and the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines secondary to AP and also increases superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in rats with sodium taurocholate-induced AP. It also has a marked ameliorative effect at histopathologic lesions. With these effects, Tau protects the cells from oxidative damage, reduces inflammation and promotes regression of pancreatic damage.
