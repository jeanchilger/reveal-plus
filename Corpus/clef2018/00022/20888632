Combinational therapy of ischemic brain stroke by delivery of heme oxygenase-1 gene and dexamethasone. Combinational therapies using genes and drugs are promising therapeutic strategies for various diseases. In this research, a co-delivery carrier of dexamethasone and plasmid DNA (pDNA) was developed by conjugation of dexamethasone to polyethylenimine (2 kDa, PEI2k) for combinational therapy of ischemic brain. Dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy and flow cytometry studies showed that the pDNA/dexamethasone-conjugated PEI2k (PEI2k-Dexa) complex was 150 nm in size and was taken up by cells more easily than PEI2k-Dexa only. The tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) level was decreased more efficiently by pDNA/PEI2k-Dexa complex than dexamethasone only in hypoxia activated Raw 264.7 macrophage cells, suggesting that pDNA/PEI2k-Dexa complex increased the delivery efficiency and therapeutic effect of dexamethasone. In in vitro transfection assay, PEI2k-Dexa had higher transfection efficiency than PEI2k and lipofectamine. However, the simple mixture of PEI2k and dexamethasone did not show this effect, suggesting that the conjugation of dexamethasone to polyethylenimine increased DNA delivery efficiency of PEI2k. To evaluate the effects of combinational therapy in vivo, pDNA/PEI2k-Dexa complex was applied to a transient focal ischemia animal model. At 24 h after the injection, mean infarction volume and the TNF-α level were reduced more efficiently in the pDNA/PEI2k-Dexa injection group, compared with the control, pDNA/PEI2k, or dexamethasone injection group. The infarction volume and inflammatory cytokines were further decreased by delivery of pSV-HO-1 using PEI2k-Dexa. Magnetic resonance imaging and microPET studies confirmed the therapeutic effect of pSV-HO-1/PEI2k-Dexa complex at 10 days after the injection. Therefore, pSV-HO-1/PEI2k-Dexa complexes may be useful in combinational therapy for ischemic diseases such as stroke.
