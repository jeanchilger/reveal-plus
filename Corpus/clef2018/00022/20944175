Randomized follow-up study of resected NSCLC patients: conventional versus 18F-DG coincidence imaging. The aim of this study was to compare the utility of gamma camera using a coincidence detection system imaging (CDET) with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose to conventional imaging techniques in the detection of recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer. Sixty-nine patients were randomized into two groups for follow-up after surgery from October 2000 to December 2002. Each patient was evaluated every 6 months by conventional technique imaging in group A (n=33) or CDET imaging in group B (n=36) over two years. The direct costs of each procedure were evaluated. The major endpoint was the number of recurrences or new tumours detected. The two groups were similar. A total of 25 recurrences was detected (9 in group A and 16 in group B). Overall survival was similar in the two groups. CDET imaging was more expensive. CDET imaging provides earlier detection of recurrence, but does not modify survival outcome. Further studies are necessary to demonstrate the impact, if any, of 18-FDG imaging.
