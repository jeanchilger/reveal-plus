Acetazolamide-challenged perfusion magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of cerebrovascular reserve capacity in patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis: comparison with technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography. Acetazolamide-challenged perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown as a method for assessment of cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) capacity in patients with atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease of internal carotid artery. We have assessed the feasibility of the acetazolamide-challenged perfusion MRI for evaluating CVR in symptomatic patients with severe middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis (≥70%) by comparison with the acetazolamide-challenged technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Seventeen prospectively enrolled patients with symptomatic unilateral MCA stenosis underwent technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime SPECT and perfusion MRI without and with acetazolamide challenge, respectively. Acetazolamide-challenged SPECT and perfusion MRI were compared quantitatively by Region of interest (ROI) analysis.At all ROIs, there were no significant differences in percent change between SPECT and perfusion MRI. Patients with impaired CVR showed significant decreases in the percent changes of respective cerebral blood flow (P=.016) and respective cerebral blood volume (P=.029).Acetazolamide-challenged perfusion MRI is feasible for evaluating CVR in symptomatic patients with severe MCA stenosis quantitatively.
