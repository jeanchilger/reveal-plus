Diversity of allergen exposure: implications for the efficacy of environmental control. The prevalence of allergic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis has increased in the last decades. The relationship between allergen exposure, atopic sensitization and development of allergic diseases is widely described in the literature.To evaluate measures for reducing allergen exposure as part of the treatment of allergic diseases.An analysis was made of previous studies on allergen exposure done with a similar methodology in the central region of Brazil the study included homes, hotels, cinemas, cars, taxis, buses and scholar transportation.High levels of Der p 1 and Der f 1 mite allergens were found in a large proportion of the sample in most of the environments included in those studies there were higher levels of pet allergens in cars and school transportation vehicles.The diversity of allergen exposure demonstrates the need for education about allergic diseases for patients and their families, as well as measures of reducing allergens in homes. This should be part of a global strategy of the management of allergic diseases, given that individuals live in society, not only in their houses.
