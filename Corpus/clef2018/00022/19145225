Imaging elevated brain arachidonic acid signaling in unanesthetized serotonin transporter (5-HTT)-deficient mice. Certain polymorphisms reduce serotonin (5-HT) reuptake transporter (5-HTT) function and increase susceptibility to psychiatric disorders. Heterozygous (5-HTT(+/-))-deficient mice, models for humans with these polymorphisms, have elevated brain 5-HT concentrations and behavioral abnormalities. As postsynaptic 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors are coupled to cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), which releases arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipid, 5-HTT-deficient mice may have altered brain AA signaling and metabolism. To test this hypothesis, signaling was imaged as an AA incorporation coefficient k(*) in unanesthetized homozygous knockout (5-HTT(-/-)), 5-HTT(+/-) and wild-type (5-HTT(+/+)), mice following saline (baseline) or 1.5 mg/kg s.c. DOI, a partial 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonist. Enzyme activities, metabolite concentrations, and head-twitch responses to DOI were also measured. Baseline k(*) was widely elevated by 20-70% in brains of 5-HTT(+/-) and 5-HTT(-/-) compared to 5-HTT(+/+) mice. DOI increased k(*) in 5-HTT(+/+) mice, but decreased k(*) in 5-HTT-deficient mice. Brain cPLA(2) activity was elevated in 5-HTT-deficient mice cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin E(2) and F(2alpha) and thromboxane B(2) concentrations were reduced. Head-twitch responses to DOI, although robust in 5-HTT(+/+) and 5-HTT(+/-) mice, were markedly fewer in 5-HTT(-/-) mice. Pretreatment with para-chlorophenylalanine, a 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, restored head twitches in 5-HTT(-/-) mice to levels in 5-HTT(+/+) mice. We propose that increased baseline values of k(*) in 5-HTT-deficient mice reflect tonic cPLA(2) stimulation through 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors occupied by excess 5-HT, and that reduced k(*) and head-twitch responses to DOI reflected displacement of receptor-bound 5-HT by DOI with a lower affinity. Increased baseline AA signaling in humans having polymorphisms with reduced 5-HTT function might be identified using positron emission tomography.
