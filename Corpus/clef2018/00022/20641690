 Optical fluorescence imaging is increasingly used to visualize biological functions of specific targets (1, 2). However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the background fluorescence interference of natural biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues. NIR fluorophores have wider dynamic range and minimal background as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. They also have high sensitivity, resulting from low infrared background, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is becoming a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals. Carbon nanotubes are made of carbon fullerene carbon units, which respond to local dielectric changes without photobleaching (3, 4). They can be tuned in a range of wavelengths for NIR absorption, thus providing broad excitation profiles and high absorption coefficients. They can be coated and capped with hydrophilic materials for additional conjugation with biomolecules, such as peptides, antibodies, nucleic acids, and small organic compounds for
