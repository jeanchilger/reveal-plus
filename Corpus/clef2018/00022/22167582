Pharmacodynamic evaluation of irinotecan therapy by FDG and FLT PET/CT imaging in a colorectal cancer xenograft model. Longitudinal changes of 3'-[(18) F]fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine (FLT) and 2-deoxy-2-[(18) F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) in response to irinotecan therapy in an animal model of colorectal cancer were compared.SCID/CB-17 mice with HCT116 tumors were treated with 50 mg/kg irinotecan by intraperitoneal injection weekly for 3 weeks. FLT and FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) were performed at baseline, the day after each treatment, and 5 days after the first treatment. Proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) after day 15 of imaging.Irinotecan treatment resulted in a suppression of tumor growth. Tumor FLT uptake was decreased the day after each treatment but to a lesser extent 5 days after the first treatment. FDG uptake increased the day after each treatment with a continuous increase throughout the experiment. IHC analysis of phospho-H3 and Ki67 confirmed FLT-PET results, indicating a decrease in proliferation the day after the final irinotecan treatment. Increased apoptosis monitored by caspase-3 was observed after day 15 with irinotecan treatment.FLT-PET may be a better method than FDG-PET for assessing treatment response to irinotecan. Changes in imaging occur before changes in tumor volume.
