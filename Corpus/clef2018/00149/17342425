Endometrial thickness and volume by three-dimensional ultrasound one week after embryo transfer to detect pregnancy. Determine if the evaluation of endometrium one week after embryo transfer can predict pregnancy.Endometrial volume and thickness were evaluated by three-dimensional ultrasound in 40 patients one week after embryo transfer. These results were compared to serum pregnancy test performed one week later.Eighteen patients have achieved pregnancy. A significant difference was found for endometrial volume: 6.49+/-1.97 mL versus 3.40+/-1.11 mL (pregnant versus not pregnant) and thickness: 11.15+/-2.75 mm versus 9.77+/-1.85 mm. The ROC curve was used to detect the best cutoff values: endometrial volume of 3.48 mL (sensitivity-100%, specificity-68.2%) and endometrial thickness of 10.3 mm (sensitivity-72.2%, specificity-77.3%). The area under curve was significant higher for endometrial volume (0.909 versus 0.745, p=0.027). No pregnancy was achieved in women who had an endometrial volume <3.8 mL (15 patients) or thickness <7.9 mm (3 patients).The endometrial volume and thickness were significant higher in pregnant women and this difference was more prominent for endometrial volume.
