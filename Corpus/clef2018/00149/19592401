Case report: Imaging features of perianal leiomyoma. A leiomyoma is a benign mesenchymal neoplasm that usually develops where smooth muscle is present. In this report, we present a rare case of perianal leiomyoma. The external anal sphincter was stretched over the surface of the leiomyoma and the internal anal sphincter was intact on surgery. It was confirmed as a deep soft-tissue leiomyoma on pathology. We describe the ultrasonographic and MRI findings of a rare case of perianal leiomyoma, together with differential diagnoses.
