Decreased endometrial vascularity in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies-associated recurrent miscarriage during midluteal phase. To explore uterine arterial impedance and endometrial-subendometrial vascularity determined by two-dimensional Doppler ultrasonography (2D-DU) and three-dimensional ultrasonography and power Doppler angiography (3D-PDA) between patients with antiphospholipid antibodies-associated recurrent miscarriage (aPL-RM) and normal fertile women, and to further investigate the relationship between these parameters and endometrial microvessel density (MVD).Prospective observational study.Tertiary-care fertility center.A total of 109 aPL-RM patients (aPL-RM group) and 49 normal fertile women (control group).Uterine measurement by transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial MVD in the midluteal phase was assessed for both groups.Endometrial thickness, volume, and MVD, uterine arterial pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI), and the vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) of endometrial and subendometrial regions were measured on day 7 of a natural cycle after ovulation.Both groups had similar endometrial thickness, volume, and MVD and uterine arterial PI and RI. Endometrial VI, FI, VFI, and subendometrial FI were significantly reduced in the aPL-RM group compared with the control group. None of the uterine arterial 2D-DU and endometrial-subendometrial 3D-PDA parameters correlated with the endometrial MVD in both groups.Endometrial and subendometrial vascularity was significantly impaired in aPL-RM patients during natural midluteal phase compared with normal fertile women, and endometrial MVD did not correlate with any of the acquired vascularity parameters.
