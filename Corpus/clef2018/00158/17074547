Subsequent risk and presentation of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cancer after a colposcopic diagnosis of CIN 1 or less. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk and presentation of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cancer after colposcopic diagnosis of CIN 1 or less.After colposcopy for an abnormal cytology, women with CIN 1 or less had annual cytology evaluations and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) tests (Hybrid Capture II). Colposcopy was repeated if the cytology result was ASC-H, or worse, ASC-US/high-risk HPV test positive, or every 2 years if the cytology was normal/high-risk HPV test positive. Differences in rates of CIN 3 or cancer were compared by log rank Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.With median follow-up periods of 26.3 months, 47 of 2490 women (1.9%) with CIN 1 or less subsequently had CIN 3 or cancer. Subsequent CIN 3 or cancer was more likely if the high-risk HPV test was initially positive (45/1960 women [2.3%]) compared with negative (2/530 women [0.4%] P = .0002) and if women were older (age > or = 30 years, 28/1021 women [2.7%]Annual cytology and high-risk HPV tests with colposcopy for high-risk HPV test positive/abnormal cytology and at least every 2 years for high-risk HPV test positive/normal cytology is advised after a colposcopic diagnosis of CIN 1 or less.
