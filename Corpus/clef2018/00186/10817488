Velocardiofacial syndrome associated with atrophy of the shoulder girdle muscles and cervicomedullary narrowing. Velocardiofacial syndrome is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans. It is secondary to a chromosome 22q11 rearrangement and is characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, heart defects and learning disability. We report a case of a 10-year-old girl with a chromosome 22q11 deletion who, in addition to learning difficulties, hypernasal speech and mild dysmorphic features, had weakness and wasting of the shoulder girdle muscles but no cardiac involvement. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed narrowing of the cervicomedullary junction. The clinical features of this patient with velocardiofacial syndrome further expand the spectrum of abnormalities associated with this condition.
