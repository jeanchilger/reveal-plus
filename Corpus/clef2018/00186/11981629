Metastatic spinal cord compression of testicular yolk sac tumor. Pediatric testicular tumors are rare. Spinal metastasis of testicular yolk sac tumor (YST) is extremely rare, with only one reported case.We report a rare case of metastatic spinal cord compression of testicular YST in a 14-month-old boy who presented with progressive paraparesis and neurological bladder dysfunction. Two months prior to admission, he underwent a left radical orchiectomy for YST of the testis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe spinal cord compression by the ventral epidural mass from T-9 to T-11 and at S-3. Emergency surgical resection was performed for tissue diagnosis and spinal decompression. Histopathological features of the epidural mass indicated metastasis of the testicular YST.Although spinal involvement with metastatic YST is rare, it must be considered in children with testicular YST exhibiting evidence of pain or weakness, and surgical decompression followed by adjuvant chemotherapy should not be delayed.
