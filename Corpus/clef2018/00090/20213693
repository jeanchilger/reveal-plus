Is FDG-PET suitable for evaluating neoadjuvant therapy in non-small cell lung cancer? Evidence with systematic review of the literature. Neoadjuvant therapy response assessment is crucial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). FDG-PET has emerged as a valuable tool for defining therapy response assessment in other tumours.To systematically review publications appearing in the literature describing induction therapy response assessment with FDG-PET in NSCLC.We performed a bibliographic search and selected only prospective studies in order to include the highest levels of evidence.Nine of 497 potentially relevant publications were selected. The ranges of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for primary tumour response assessment were 80-100%, 0-100%, 42.9-100%, and 66.7-100%, respectively. Pooling data for N2 restaging after neoadjuvant response the overall sensitivity was 63.8% (95% CI, 53.3-73.7%) and overall specificity was 85.3% (95% CI, 80.4-89.4%).The results of the analysis do not support the use of FDG-PET as the only re-assessment tool for mediastinal lymph node evaluation for routine clinical use. FDG-PET seems to predict primary tumour response to induction therapy but it could not be shown by pooling analysis.
