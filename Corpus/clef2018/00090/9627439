Positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in oncology. The use of 18FDG highlights biochemical disturbations present in cancerous tissues, in particular the accelerated glycolysis related to increased glucose transporters and to the increased activity of the enzymes of glycolysis. The recent availability of whole-body PET tomographs has opened the way to a variety of oncological applications. The usefulness of 18FDG-PET at various stages of diagnosis, staging and therapy follow-up has now been demonstrated. We demonstrate some of these indications, in particular in lung cancers, lymphomas and colorectal carcinomas.
