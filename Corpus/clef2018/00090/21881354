A clinical study of the prognostic factors for postoperative early recurrence in patients who underwent complete resection for pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The 2-[F-18]-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) and serum neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are recently noteworthy prognostic factors. We studied the prognostic factor to predict early recurrence after curative resection for pulmonary adenocarcinoma including FDG uptake and NLR.We performed a retrospective review of 23 patients who underwent a complete resection for pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 19 patients in the disease-free group, and 4 patients in the recurrent group. Clinical and pathological factors concerning the recurrence within 1 year of surgery were analyzed between two groups.No significant differences between the recurrent group and disease-free group was seen in age, gender, CEA, NLR, CRP, pathological stage, pleural invasion, pathological grading, Ki-67 expression, venous invasion and lymphatic invasion. The SUVmax was significantly elevated in the recurrent group (12.5 ± 2.01 vs. 5.70 ± 3.97, p = 0.0094). Tumor size was significantly larger in the recurrent group (5.58 ± 0.71 vs. 3.62 ± 1.33 cm, p = 0.0058). The first, recurrent sites in 4 patients were brain, in 3 patients and lung, in 1 patient.Both tumor size and SUVmax are possible predictors of early recurrence after curative resection in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Although it is impossible to determine the SUVmax as an independent prognostic factor, the SUVmax may be one of the predictors of early hematogenous recurrence in surgically treated pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
