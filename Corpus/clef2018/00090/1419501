Clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, measures of disease activity, and long-term complications. Studies of renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus continue to dominate the clinical literature. Reports of the prognostic significance of both clinical and histologic parameters at the time of renal biopsy are discussed. The potential impact of anticardiolipin antibodies on the development of renal insufficiency is described. The outcome of renal transplantation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is assessed in a study concerned with both allograft survival and recurrence of active nephritis in the transplanted kidney. The incidence and prognosis of various features of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus are discussed, while the search for an accurate indicator of lupus involvement of the central nervous system continues. Magnetic resonance imaging and single-photon-emission computed tomography are considered. Abnormalities of pulmonary gas exchange are featured in several reports. Features of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome are presented, stressing predisposition to thrombosis. The definition and characteristics of systemic lupus erythematosus disease flares is discussed, in relation to several recently developed disease activity indexes. The attempt to distinguish systemic lupus erythematosus activity from infection and preeclampsia is also considered. Finally, the association of systemic lupus erythematosus with the development of cancer is discussed.
