PET-CT in oncology: making the most of CT. Combined positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) has made a significant impact on cancer imaging. The use of CT to map tissue attenuation for correction of PET images and the ability to co-register the functional information provided by PET with the anatomical data afforded by CT, has resulted in demonstrable improvements in diagnostic accuracy. However, attenuation correction and anatomical localisation may not represent the full benefits of integrating CT with PET. The use of CT acquisition techniques for patient positioning and the use of contrast media can improve diagnostic performance, and incorporation of CT image processing techniques such as perfusion CT, 3D imaging and computer-assisted diagnosis offers new applications. The interpretation of PET-CT images can be improved by fully integrating the morphological appearances on CT into image analysis. Better utilisation of the CT component of PET-CT could further enhance the benefits of PET-CT in oncology but will have implications for manufacturers and purchasers of PET-CT equipment and analysis software. Furthermore, specialists working in PET-CT will need CT competencies beyond knowledge of cross-sectional anatomy. CT continues to exhibit rapid evolution and these advances will inevitably impact on the practice of PET-CT.
