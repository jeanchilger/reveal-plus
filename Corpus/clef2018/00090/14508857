Surgery for early stage non-small cell lung cancer. Lung cancer accounts for 28.2% of all cancer-related deaths in the United States. Most patients present with advanced-stage disease, with only 15% having disease confined to the lung. Surgical resection is the optimal treatment for Stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer. Pre-resection staging includes various radiographic modalities, including PET scan and mediastinoscopy. Survival and local recurrence statistics favor full anatomic lobar resection over sublobar resection, although cases must be judged individually. Lobectomy via thoracoscopic approach appears to have equivalent outcome as lobectomy via thoracotomy. Characteristics of the counseling physician and the hospital volume at which the surgery is performed can also influence outcome. After surgical resection, stage IA patients have about 70% 5-year survival, but this falls below 50% for stage IIB patients. Methods that identify early-stage lung cancer patients at greatest risk for recurrence are needed to identify patients who may benefit from additional therapies.
