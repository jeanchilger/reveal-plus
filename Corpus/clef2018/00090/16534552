Positron emission tomography measurement of tumor metabolism and growth: its expanding role in oncology. This work highlights the explosion and evolution of positron emission tomography (PET) for use in oncology research and clinical practice. 2-Deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-PET is important in the staging of cancer, estimation of prognosis, and for its ability to predict therapeutic outcome. A number of new imaging agents are under development and may find a place in oncology when studies prove their utility. This scientific overview includes a review of the development of a number of thymidine analogs, such as 18F-3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (FLT) and 18F-1-(2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl)-thymine (FMAU), including chemical structure variations their application in a variety of tumors
