The significance of 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT liver perfusion imaging in treatment planning for 90Y-microsphere selective internal radiation treatment. Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), a catheter-based liver-directed modality for treating primary and metastatic liver cancer, requires appropriate planning to maximize its therapeutic response and minimize its side effects. (99m)Tc-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) scanning should precede the therapy to detect any extrahepatic shunting to the lung or gastrointestinal tract. Our aim was to compare the ability of SPECT/CT with that of planar imaging and SPECT in the detection and localization of extrahepatic (99m)Tc-MAA accumulation and to evaluate the impact of SPECT/CT on SIRT treatment planning and its added value to angiography in this setting.Ninety diagnostic hepatic angiograms with (99m)Tc-MAA were obtained for 76 patients with different types of cancer. All images were reviewed retrospectively for extrahepatic MAA deposition in the following order: planar, non-attenuation-corrected SPECT, and SPECT/CT. Review of angiograms and follow-up of patients with abdominal shunting served as reference standards.Extrahepatic accumulation was detected by planar imaging, SPECT, and SPECT/CT in 12%, 17%, and 42% of examinations, respectively. The sensitivity for detecting extrahepatic shunting with planar imaging, SPECT, and SPECT/CT was 32%, 41%, and 100%, respectively specificity was 98%, 98%, and 93%, respectively. The respective positive predictive values were 92%, 93%, and 89%, and the respective negative predictive values were 71%, 73%, and 100%. The therapy plan was changed according to the results of planar imaging, SPECT, and SPECT/CT in 7.8%, 8.9%, and 29% of patients, respectively.In pre-SIRT planning, (99m)Tc-MAA SPECT/CT is valuable for identifying extrahepatic visceral sites at risk for postradioembolization complications.
