EEG power changes are related to regional cerebral glucose metabolism in vascular dementia. In patients with vascular dementia (VD), the relationship between the EEG power within the 4 frequency bands and the regional metabolic disturbances was investigated.Twenty-eight patients (age 69.0+/-6.54 years) with VD according to NINDS-AIREN criteria underwent quantitative EEG recording, according to the 10-20 system, and fluodeoxyglucose F18 positron emission tomography (PET) at resting condition within 24 h. EEG power FFT-analysis was performed for delta (2-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13.5-20 Hz) frequency bands. Regional EEG power bands were related to regional glucose metabolism in anatomically defined regions corresponding to locations of the 10-20 system.Correlation between slow frequency band power and glucose metabolism was found. A widespread inverse relationship of delta power to metabolism was found between various regions additionally, delta power was negatively correlated to cerebral glucose metabolism in individual regions. Frontal theta power correlated especially with thalamic CMRglc. Alpha power correlated directly with metabolism in the occipital lobe. No significant relationships were found between beta power and metabolism.We conclude that EEG power in VD is linked to glucose metabolism, indicating specific regional dependencies.
