Prognostic value of preoperative FDG-PET in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been found to have prognostic value. We previously reported the correlation between SUVmax and pathological invasive area, and determined an SUVmax cut-off value of 2.15 for predicting the recurrence potential of an invasive area of diameter 5mm. Here, we evaluate the validity of FDG-PET for prediction of recurrence in pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma.From February 2006 to May 2008, 100 patients with pathological stage IA lung adenocarcinoma underwent complete resection at our hospital. Tumors were classified as air-type or solid-type based on thin-section computed tomography (TS-CT) findings and the influence of TS-CT classification, SUVmax, and clinicopathologic features were evaluated in terms of the incidence of recurrence.Unlike air-type adenocarcinomas, recurrent disease was detected in 8 of 62 solid-type adenocarcinomas. SUVmax and diameter of invasive area were significantly correlated with recurrence and a shorter time to recurrence. All 8 recurrent cases had pathological invasive area >5mm. All except one case of recurrence were solid-type adenocarcinomas with SUVmax≥2.15. Three-year disease-free survival rates were 100% in air-type adenocarcinomas, 97.1% in solid-type adenocarcinomas with SUVmax<2.15, and 74.1% in solid-type adenocarcinoma with SUVmax≥2.15.Combined evaluation of TS-CT classification and SUVmax had significant value in predicting recurrence in stage IA lung adenocarcinoma, reflecting the aggressiveness of primary lung adenocarcinoma. Prediction of tumor aggressiveness could contribute to decision-making regarding the choice of surgical procedure and treatment after surgery.
