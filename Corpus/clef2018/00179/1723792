Abnormal production of interleukin-1 by microglia from trisomy 16 mice. The production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) was examined in cultured CNS microglia obtained from trisomy 16 (Ts16) fetal mouse brain, a model system for studies relevant to Down syndrome (DS). When compared to microglia from their normal littermates, Ts16 microglia produced significantly higher levels of IL-1 activity both before and following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). IL-1 release was stimulated by alpha/beta interferon (IFN) in the normal but not Ts16 microglial cultures. The overall level of IL-1 production in normal littermates, however, was still less than that seen in Ts16. Thus, microglia from Ts16 mice may function in an inappropriate manner and, if this abnormality occurs in vivo, may have wide ranging effects on a developing nervous system.
