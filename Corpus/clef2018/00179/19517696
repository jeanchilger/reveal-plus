First-trimester biochemistry and outcomes in twin pregnancy. To examine the relationship between levels of first-trimester serum analytes used in aneuploidy risk assessment and obstetric outcomes in twin pregnancy.Twin pregnancies undergoing first-trimester risk assessment from 2003 to 2005 were identified. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) were measured at 9-14 weeks. The association between extreme biochemical values (< 5th and > 95th percentile) and adverse outcomes was examined. Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U were used for comparison.A total of 326 pregnancies were included. Median maternal age was 35 years. Median gestational age at delivery was 36 weeks. There were no significant associations between extreme free beta-hCG or high PAPP-A values and the rates of any adverse outcomes. Low PAPP-A (< 0.52 multiples of the median) was associated with higher rates of discordant growth (50% vs. 13% p = 0.001) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (41.2% vs. 15.5%, p = 0.01).In twin pregnancies, low PAPP-A is associated with discordant growth and hypertensive disorders.
