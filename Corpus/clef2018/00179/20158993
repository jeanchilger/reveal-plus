Improved detection of aneuploid blastocysts using a new 12-chromosome FISH test. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) has been the principal method used for the identification and preferential transfer of chromosomally normal embryos, in the context of both preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and screening (PGS). Generally, the probe combinations used during PGS have focused on chromosomes frequently identified as abnormal in prenatal samples or material derived from first-trimester spontaneous abortions. Recent data, however, obtained with the use of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), have suggested that commonly used PGS strategies may fail to detect a large number of aneuploidies affecting preimplantation embryos. Some chromosomes, which have been relatively neglected in PGS protocols thus far, display a disproportionate contribution to embryo aneuploidy and should be prioritized for screening. Using CGH data, it is possible to design new probe combinations that examine between 10 and 12 chromosomes and are capable of accurately diagnosing 89-91% of anomalies seen in embryos. At present, 24-chromosome tests, such as CGH, array CGH or single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, remain relatively costly and, in some cases, are yet to be fully validated. For these reasons, a cost-effective method, capable of accurately detecting almost all aneuploid embryos, represents an attractive alternative to comprehensive chromosome screening approaches.
