Prenatal identification of a 45,X/46,Xder(Y) mosaicism and confirmation by high resolution cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A 45,X/46,Xder(Y) mosaicism detected prenatally was shown to have a rare Y inversion-duplication or Y/Y translocation which can only be identified by a combination of high resolution cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The present data indicate the usefulness and importance of chromosome-specific probes in the identification and characterization of chromosome rearrangements.
