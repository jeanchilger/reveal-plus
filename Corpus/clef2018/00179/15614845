Does nuchal translucency have a role in fetal cardiac screening? Increased nuchal translucency is the strongest single marker for chromosomal abnormality. Consequently, it is currently becoming established as the foundation of most early screening programmes for Down syndrome. In the absence of chromosomal abnormality, increased nuchal translucency has been shown to be associated with other congenital anomalies including cardiac defects. Several datasets have now reported this association and here these are reviewed to assess the effectiveness of nuchal translucency measurement as a screening tool for the prenatal detection of congenital heart disease.
