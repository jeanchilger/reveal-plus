Etiology and outcome of non-immune hydrops fetalis in southern Thailand. To study the etiology and outcome of non-immune hydrops fetalis in southern Thailand.The medical records and videotape recordings of all pregnant women diagnosed with non-immune fetal hydrops, from January 1993 to December 2002 were reviewed.Non-immune hydrops fetalis was documented in 71 cases. The causes of fetal hydrops were identified in 87.3%. Homozygous alpha-thalassemia-1 dominated as the cause of non-immune fetal hydrops (28.2%), followed by structural abnormalities (15.5%) and infection (12.7%). The underlying etiology remained unknown in 9 cases (12.7%). The overall survival rate of non-immune hydrops fetalis cases was 4.2%. Spontaneous regression occurred in 2 cases. Two cases were lost to follow up after initial evaluation. Termination of pregnancy was performed in 47 cases. There were 12 dead fetuses in utero, 2 stillbirths, 5 early neonatal deaths and only 3 cases survived.Homozygous alpha-thalassemia-1 is the most common cause of non-immune hydrops fetalis in southern Thailand, and the overall prognosis of non-immune hydrops fetalis is poor. We suggest that an effective thalassemia-screening program for prevention and control of homozygous alpha-thalassemia-1 be established in all areas where the alpha-thalassemia-1 gene is prevalent.
