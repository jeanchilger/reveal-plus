Prenatal diagnosis and outcome of isolated vascular rings. The purpose of this study was to describe our experience in the ultrasound visualization and management of prenatally diagnosed isolated vascular rings. From January 2002 to December 2007, a total of 19 fetuses had a sonographic diagnosis of isolated vascular rings in 2 reference centers at a mean gestational age of 23 weeks. There were 8 cases of left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery, 5 cases of double aortic arch, and 6 cases of right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery. Two fetuses had associated trisomy 21 and 1 had a 22q11 microdeletion. Parents chose to terminate the pregnancy in all cases. Four patients successfully underwent surgical correction, and in 1 patient, tracheoplasty was also performed. In conclusion, isolated vascular rings can be accurately diagnosed prenatally by using the "3-vessel and trachea view" and "supra-aortic-branch view" that allow detection of vascular structures running around the trachea. Karyotyping and prenatal testing for 22q11 microdeletions should be offered to all parents. Affected children should undergo surgical correction as soon as symptoms of tracheal compression appear, avoiding tracheomalacia. Associated congenital tracheal stenosis should be excluded before surgery.
