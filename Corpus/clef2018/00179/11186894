Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 4 mosaicism. Trisomy 4 mosaicism is rare. To our knowledge only two cases of prenatally diagnosed trisomy 4 mosaicism have been reported. One case resulted in a normal liveborn male, the other resulted in an abnormal liveborn female. The karyotype of our case at the time of amniocentesis was 47,XY,+4[3]/ 46,XY[33] and resulted in a normal liveborn male. FISH analysis using an alpha satellite chromosome 4 probe was performed to confirm the cytogenetic findings. Follow-up chromosome analysis of cord blood, peripheral blood, foreskin, and umbilical cord fibroblasts showed a normal 46,XY male karyotype in all cells. FISH analysis of cord blood, umbilical cord fibroblasts, and amniotic fluid cells demonstrated two signals in 246 nuclei (i.e., 46,XY) and three signals in six nuclei (i.e., 47,XY,+4). Here we describe the present case of trisomy 4 mosaicism, the literature is reviewed, and the significance of this finding is discussed.
