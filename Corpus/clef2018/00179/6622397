Fetoscopy and fetal blood sampling in the management of a twin pregnancy with 45,X/46,XX amniotic fluid cell mosaicism and a suspected fluid sampling error. A 37 year-old woman with a twin pregnancy underwent amniocentesis to exclude fetal chromosome abnormality. The results indicated that both fetuses were mosaics, with 45,X and 46,XX, cell lines. Since it was suspected from the ultrasound scan that the twins were dizygotic, the result was questioned. Fetoscopy and fetal blood sampling were performed and karyotyping the fetal lymphocytes confirmed that one twin was indeed a mosaic, 45,X/46,XX, but the other had a normal male chromosome complement. The pregnancy resulted in the birth of a phenotypically normal girl, in whom the 45,X/46,XX mosaicism was confirmed, and a normal boy.
