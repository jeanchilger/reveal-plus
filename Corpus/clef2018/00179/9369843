Quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction for the rapid prenatal detection of common aneuploidies and fetal sex. We have developed a quantitative fluorescence multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for the rapid detection of sex and aneuploidies involving chromosomes 21, 18, and 13.Samples of deoxyribonucleic acid (n = 85) extracted from amniotic fluid, fetal tissues, and blood were investigated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction amplification of polymorphic small tandem repeat markers specific for chromosomes 21, 18, 13, and X.Quantitative analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products allowed us to distinguish between normal samples and samples with autosomal trisomies while sexing was performed simultaneously. From 85 samples only three produced unsatisfactory results with one of the two chromosome 13-specific markers. In these three cases the amplification of the other chromosome 13 marker always resulted in a correct normal pattern.Quantitative fluorescence multiplex polymerase chain reaction is a reliable and rapid method that allows prenatal diagnosis of the major numeric chromosomal abnormalities to be performed within 24 hours.
