Unexplained elevated serum hCG is associated with raised amniotic fluid erythropoietin levels in second-trimester pregnancies. This study was designed to investigate the association between the concentrations of maternal serum hCG and amniotic fluid erythropoietin during the second trimester of pregnancy.In a prospective case-control study, 42 consecutive singleton pregnancies showing unexplained elevated serum hCG concentrations (>2.0 multiples of the median, MoM) in Down's syndrome screening and 27 control pregnant women undergoing midtrimester amniocentesis because of a previous cytogenetic abnormality were studied.The mean amniotic fluid erythropoietin concentration in the study group was 1.8 (range 0.61-8.7) MoM, whereas it was 1.1 (range 0.71-3. 96) MoM in the controls (p = 0.035). A significantly increasing relationship (p < 0.05) was found between the concentrations of maternal serum hCG and amniotic fluid erythropoietin.The results of the current study revealed in vivo the association between elevated hCG and amniotic fluid erythropoietin levels which, in turn, supports the concept of early placental damage. The underlying pathology seems to be sufficient to cause an erythroblastic response.
