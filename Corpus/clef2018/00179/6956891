Human amniotic fluid cells grown in a hormone-supplemented medium: suitability for prenatal diagnosis. A new supplemented medium has been developed to improve human amniotic fluid cell growth and to reduce the dependence on exogenously added serum. The medium consists of a mixture of Ham's F12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with Hepes, antibiotics, and 10 growth-promoting factors at 4% fetal bovine serum. Good clonal growth is achieved consistently in 8--13 days and is associated with large numbers of metaphase cells. Primary clones may be analyzed directly, thereby reducing difficulty with interpretation of chromosomal mosaicism. This medium could also be used for cultivation of fetal solid tissues and peripheral blood cultures of lymphocytes.
