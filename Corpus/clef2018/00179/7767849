Congenital malformation in newborns. Analysis of 501 cases. Over a 14-year period in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, 510 out of 44, 362 newborns were found to have birth defects. Maternal age, gestational age, parity, infant sex and birth weight were analyzed for each anomaly and compared to normal newborns. The average maternal age and parity for newborns with congenital anomalies were not significantly different from normal newborns. Mothers giving birth to babies with chromosomal aberrations, however, had a significantly older maternal age than the normal population. The gestational age at delivery was significantly shorter for all except craniofacial anomaly. In addition, there was a high percentage of intrauterine growth retardation in congenital anomalies. The central nervous system, the musculoskeletal system and craniofacial systems were the most commonly involved. The leading anomalies included cleft lip, cleft palate, anencephaly, polydactyly, hydrops fetalis, trisomy 21 and cystic hygroma. With improved ultrasound equipment and other prenatal diagnostic procedures, many defects of the fetus can now be identified. If the fetus is diagnosed with a surgically correctable lesion like cleft lip, it can be kept to term, delivered, then managed postnatally. If life-incompatible malformations have been detected before the 24th week, physicians are in a good position to counsel the parents. After the 24th week termination is proscribed by law. Therefore, physicians must take special care to detect fetal abnormalities early.
