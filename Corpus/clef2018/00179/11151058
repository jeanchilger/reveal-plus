Comparative genomic hybridization: a new tool for reproductive pathology. To demonstrate the effectiveness of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for analysis of reproductive pathology specimens in clinical cytogenetics laboratories.A total of 856 CGH analyses were performed on various placental and fetal tissues derived from 368 specimens of spontaneous abortions and on placentas from 219 pregnancies with live-born infants. The live-born infants were clinically evaluated as normally developed, with either a normal birth weight or with intrauterine growth restriction some live-born infants had an abnormal prenatal triple screen with normal cytogenetic results on amniotic fluid cell cultures.Comparative genomic hybridization analysis was successfully performed on 856 samples from spontaneously aborted specimens and term placentas. Failure of analysis occurred in 1.6% of samples and was due to an insufficient amount of tissue for DNA extraction. Comparative genomic hybridization identified aneuploidy in 53% of spontaneous abortion samples and 3.1% of term placentas.Comparative genomic hybridization analysis is a useful clinical tool for detection of aneuploidy in placental and fetal tissues. It provides a genome-wide screen while eliminating tissue culture failures, culture artifacts, and maternal cell contamination. We present practical guidelines for interpreting CGH profiles derived from human reproductive specimens.
