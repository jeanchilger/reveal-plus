Replicate real-time PCR testing of DNA in maternal plasma increases the sensitivity of non-invasive fetal sex determination. We determined fetal sex in pregnancies referred for invasive prenatal diagnosis procedures by analysis of DNA in maternal plasma.Twelve pregnancies at risk of X-linked haemophilia and 32 pregnancies at risk of chromosomal aneuploidies at a gestational age ranging from 10 to 18 weeks recruited before chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis were involved in the study. Male fetal DNA in maternal plasma was detected by using real-time polymerase chain reaction with the SRY gene as a marker.The specificity of the system reached 100% (no Y signal was detected in 17 women pregnant with a female fetus) and the sensitivity reached 100% (SRY amplification in 27 examined samples).Amplification of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma is a valid and rapid technique for predicting fetal sex in first- and second-trimester pregnancies and could allow the restriction of invasive sampling procedures to male fetuses at risk of X-linked disorders.
