46,XY,dup(10q) in direct CVS preparation and mosaic 48,XXXY,dup(10q) in CVS long-term culture and fetal tissue. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) was performed on a 40-year-old woman at 9 1/2 menstrual weeks because of advanced maternal age. The direct preparation showed 46,XY,dup(10)(q11.2q23.2). CVS long-term culture and fetal tissue revealed a rare additional abnormality: 48,XXXY,dup(10)(q11.2q23.2). This abnormality represented the major cell line (> 85 per cent in 691 cells) in an (XY)/XXY/XXXY/(XXXXY) mosaic (all cell lines presumably bearing the dup(10q) the presence of XY and XXXXY cell lines is uncertain). To our knowledge, this is the first report of trisomy 10q11-q23 and of prenatally detected 48,XXXY in chorionic villi. The mosaic could have resulted from early post-zygotic non-disjunctions in a 46,XY,dup(10q) or 47,XXY,dup(10q) zygote. The results from DNA studies of four polymorphisms, mapped to Xp and Xq, support this theory. The literature on prenatally detected cases with sex chromosome tetrasomy and pentasomy and those with additional autosomal abnormalities is reviewed. The reported case underlines the problem of false-negative findings when only direct CVS preparations are karyotyped.
