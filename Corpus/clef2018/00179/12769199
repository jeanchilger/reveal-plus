Use of genetic sonography for adjusting the risk for fetal Down syndrome. Systematic evaluation of ultrasound findings known to be associated with trisomy 21, at an appropriate gestational age, has been referred to as a genetic sonogram. A number of high-risk centers performing genetic sonography have reported detection of ultrasound abnormalities in the majority of fetuses with fetal Down syndrome. However, nonspecific markers are more commonly observed than structural abnormalities, which are detected in less than 20% of cases in a nonselected population. Also, the actual sensitivity of a genetic sonogram will depend on various factors including the markers sought, gestational age, reasons for referral, and of course the quality of the ultrasound. Appropriate use of a genetic sonogram can help to modify the risk of fetal Down syndrome by decreasing the risk when the ultrasound is normal, or increasing the risk when specific ultrasound markers are detected. The postultrasound risk can be estimated by applying specific likelihood ratios, reflecting the strength of individual markers, with the a priori risk based on maternal age alone, or combined with biochemical markers when known. We review this approach of age-adjusted ultrasound risk assessment for fetal Down syndrome and illustrate how the risk can be estimated. Individual sonographic markers are also discussed.
