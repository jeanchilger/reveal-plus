Increased adhesiveness of Down syndrome fetal fibroblasts in vitro. We compared the in vitro rate of divalent cation-independent aggregation of fibroblasts derived from abortuses with normal karyotypes and with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Fibroblasts from five lung and two of three cardiac cultures from subjects with Down syndrome aggregated more rapidly than matched fibroblasts from normal controls or lung fibroblasts from an abortus with trisomy 13. In contrast, skin fibroblasts derived from the trisomy 21 subjects had low rates of aggregation. The high rates of aggregation of trisomy 21 lung fibroblasts were not affected by hyaluronidase treatment. Lung fibroblasts from both normal and Down syndrome subjects had similar membrane polarization values in an assay using the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Thus, the increased aggregation rate we observed for trisomy 21 fibroblasts was restricted to specific fibroblast cultures, was not mediated by hyaluronic acid or gross membrane lipid alterations, and was specific for trisomy of chromosome 21. As illustrated in computer simulations presented elsewhere, increased intercellular adhesiveness during organogenesis could explain the frequent occurrence of malformations, including pulmonary hypoplasia and congenital heart defects, in Down syndrome.
