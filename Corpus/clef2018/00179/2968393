Recourse to amniocentesis after the age of 38. Factors related to access to medical care. Antenatal screening by amniocentesis was not much used in Haute-Normandie (France) in 1981. This study compared 59 women aged 38 and over who did benefit from this test with a control sample of 71 women who delivered in the same region at the same time and who were not screened. The use of the screening was linked to the socio-professional category of the woman, to her professional activity, to her nationality, to where she studied, to her parity, and the quality of her obstetrical care. The information that the women who were screened had about trisomy 21 and its screening was far higher in those who were screened. Regression analysis indicates that there are 3 factors that play an important role: whether the specialist or the general practitioner offered the screening test and the socio-professional category of the woman. Amniocentesis could be used much more efficiently if the population was better informed and if the medical corps made a special effort as well as providing more screening facilities.
