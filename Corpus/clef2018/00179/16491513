Detecting sex chromosome anomalies and common triploidies in products of conception by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. In recent years, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) has moved to the forefront of molecular cytogenetics with its ability to rapidly characterize chromosome abnormalities at resolutions much higher than routine chromosome banding. However, array CGH, like all CGH procedures, has heretofore been deemed unable to detect ploidy, a major cause of fetal demise and spontaneous miscarriage.We recently developed a CGH microarray that is designed for detecting aneuploidy and unbalanced chromosome rearrangements. Here, we introduce the use of a Klinefelter male cell line (47,XXY) as a control for array CGH analyses on products of conception (POCs).This approach facilitates the detection of common trisomies and monosomies of the sex chromosomes by reducing the analysis to the identification of single copy gains or losses. Furthermore, in a blinded study, careful interpretation of the microarray results with particular attention to the sex chromosome ratios between the patient sample and the control allowed for the detection of some common triploidies.These results suggest that using a chromosomally abnormal cell line in array CGH analysis can be applied to other CGH platforms and that array CGH, when properly performed and analyzed, is a powerful tool that can detect most chromosomal abnormalities observed in a clinical setting including some polyploidies.
