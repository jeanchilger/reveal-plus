A dorsal root ganglia cell line derived from trisomy 16 fetal mice, a model for Down syndrome. We have established two immortalized cell lines from dorsal root ganglia of normal (G4b) and trisomy 16 mice (GT1), a model for Down syndrome. By immunohistochemistry, both cell lines exhibit neuronal traits and lack glial markers. GTl cells exhibited greater [3H]choline uptake than G4b cells. K+ and nicotine-mediated acetylcholine release was greater in GT1 cells. Basal intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was significantly lower in GTl cells. More GTl cells responded to neurotransmitters with a transient [Ca2+]i increase compared to G4b cells, but both cell types showed similar amplitudes of [Ca2+]i responses. The results show that both cell lines retain neuronal characteristics and respond to specific neurotransmitter stimuli. Altered GT1 cell responses could be related to neuronal pathophysiology in Down's syndrome.
