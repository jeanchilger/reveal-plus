Prevalence of Down's syndrome in Asturias, 1987-1993. Members of the Work Group of the RCDA. To determine the frequency of Down Syndrome (DS) in Asturias and the prenatal diagnosis impact on the birth prevalence of this chromosomal anomaly.The analysed data came from the Registry of Congenital Defects of Asturias (1990-1993) and from a retrospective study conducted by the same working group (1987-1989). The total prevalence rates and the prevalence at birth were calculated.Out of 55,601 births, DS was recorded in 83 cases: 69 livebirths, two fetal deaths and 12 induced abortions following prenatal diagnosis, giving a total prevalence rate of 14.9 per 10,000 and a birth prevalence of 12.8. The proportion of induced abortions was 15 per cent in this period the proportion of cases in the high risk maternal age group (35 years and over) was around 50% of the total. The proportion of induced abortions was 15 per cent in this period.The frequency of DS in Asturias is comparable to the other populations. Prenatal diagnosis had little impact on the birth prevalence figures. These results may help us draw up prevention and prenatal diagnosis policies for these defects in Asturias when giving the frequency of this health problem.
