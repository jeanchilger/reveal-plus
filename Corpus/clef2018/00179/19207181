Expression of the congenital heart disease 5/tryptophan rich basic protein homologue gene during heart development in medaka fish, Oryzias latipes. The congenital heart disease 5 (CHD5)/tryptophan rich basic protein (WRB) is a protein containing a tryptophan-rich carboxy-terminal region, which was discovered in the human fetal heart. In humans, this CHD5/WRB is located between the markers ACTL5-D21S268 within the Down syndrome (DS) Region-2 at chromosome 21. Congenital heart disease is commonly linked to DS patients. The functions of this gene product are unknown. To identify the functions of CHD5/WRB in heart formation during embryogenesis, the medaka CHD5 cDNA (mCHD5) was isolated and its gene expression pattern and the localization of its gene product were investigated. The obtained mCHD5 belongs to the CHD5 superfamily, whose members include coiled-coil proteins. The mCHD5 gene was found to be expressed in the developing heart after stage 28 at which the chamber (ventricle and atrium) differentiation in the heart tube is initiated in the embryo. Its gene product was also detected in the developing heart at embryonic stage 28 and 35. Knocking-down of mCHD5 function caused severe cardiac disorder, including abnormal chamber differentiation, abnormal looping and ocular abnormality such as Cyclops. Our results provide the mCHD5 gene expression pattern as well as its physiological role during heart formation in a vertebrate model system.
