Aspects of digestive tract tumors in Down syndrome: a literature review. The purpose of this study was to describe the digestive neoplasms found in persons with Down syndrome. Due to intellectual disability, persons with Down syndrome do not convey their symptoms and pain, leading to delayed diagnosis and potentially worse outcome. It is thus important to know which organs are at risk for tumors and possible tumor risk factors. In a review of the literature, we found 13 benign tumors and 127 cancers in 1 fetus, 8 children, and 131 adults with Down syndrome. The review suggests a decreased incidence of digestive cancer, however, with a possible increased incidence of neoplasms of the pancreas and gallbladder. The distribution of cancers is distinct from that in the general population and that in persons with other intellectual disabilities who share the same life conditions, suggesting that constitutional protective factors exist. This review may allow a more specific, adapted medical follow-up for persons with Down syndrome and could help to elucidate the oncogenesis of digestive neoplasms.
