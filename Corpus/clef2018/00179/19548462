Polish Gynaecological Society guideline on prenatal diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis is a multidisciplinary issue where obstetricians, geneticists, neonatologists and doctors representing other specialities are involved. The guideline will provide up-to-date information, based on clinical evidence optimal techniques and timing, training and competence and clinical governance issues. Prenatal screening for chromosomal defects should be performed in concordance with Polish Gynaecological Society guidelines and recommendations on antenatal care, ultrasound in pregnancy and fetal therapy, and Fetal Medicine Foundation (London, UK) rules. There is no doubt that maternal age alone as a method of screening for chromosomal abnormalities should be abandoned as it has low Detection Rate with high False Positive Rate hence high Invasive Procedure Rate and unnecessary high pregnancy loss rate. The Working Party recommends that screening methods based on ultrasound examination at 11(+0)-13(+6) wks and maternal serum biochemistry should be implemented. Special attention must be paid to ensure that sufficiently high Detection Rate is achieved (at least 75% for 5% False Positive Rate) in screening for trisomy 21.
