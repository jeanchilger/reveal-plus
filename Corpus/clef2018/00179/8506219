Mosaicism in chorionic villus sampling: an analysis of incidence and chromosomes involved in 2612 consecutive cases. The incidence of chromosome mosaicism was analysed in 2612 consecutive chorionic villus sampling (CVS) cases. True mosaicism was found in five cases (0.19 per cent). Confined placental mosaicism (CPM) occurred in 51 cases (1.9 per cent). The chromosomes most frequently encountered in CPM were 2, 7, 8, and the sex chromosomes. Three types of CPM as proposed by Kalousek et al. (1992) were observed. Cases with CPM had a statistically significant association with spontaneous abortion (chi 2 = 3.92, p < 0.05). Based on the data analysed, we conclude that (1) CPM is as likely to occur in cultured chorionic villi as in the direct preparation (2) as with amniocyte culture, chromosome 2 mosaicism occurs commonly in villus culture
