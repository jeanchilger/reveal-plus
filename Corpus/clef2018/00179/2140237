Femur length shortening in the detection of Down syndrome: is prenatal screening feasible? The potential utility of screening for femur length shortening in prenatal detection of Down syndrome (trisomy 21) was evaluated by comparing 49 consecutive fetuses with Down syndrome with 572 chromosomally normal fetuses before genetic amniocentesis. Ratios of measured femur length/predicted femur length and biparietal diameter/femur length were calculated for each fetus. The predicted femur length was calculated from a regression equation relating the biparietal diameter and femur length derived from a sample control group. With this normal regression equation, 7 of 49 (14.3%) fetuses with Down syndrome had short femur lengths (measured femur length/predicted femur length ratio of less than or equal to 0.91) compared with 35 of 572 (6.1%) fetuses with a normal karyotype (p less than 0.05). However, the maximum positive predictive value for identification of Down syndrome based on short femur lengths was only 0.93% for a high-risk population (prevalence of Down syndrome, 1:250) and 0.33% for a low-risk population (prevalence of Down syndrome, 1:700). We conclude that ultrasonographic screening of short femur length is less effective for prenatal detection of Down syndrome than initially suggested.
