Initial experiences with amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis in pregnancy following in-vitro fertilization. We report on first experiences with amniocentesis in 63 pregnancies after IVF treatment over a period of 3 years. It is shown, that there is no increased risk through amniocentesis it does not require special precautions. Above average number of aberrations could be found in amniotic cultures in cases where it could be identified additionally in one parent. It remains to be seen, whether the small number and sterility causes were coincidental or manifest themselves in future, especially, if the sterility concerned can be classified as idiopathic. The occurrence of trisomy 21 in accordance with the frequency is to be expected in the group of persons over 35 years of age and no increased risk through IVF treatment can be found.
