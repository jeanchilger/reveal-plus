Confined placental mosaicisms a priori from meiotic origin: analysis of 10 cases. This retrospective monocenter study focused on confined placental mosaicisms a priori from meiotic origin (i.e. non-mosaic type 3 confined placental mosaicisms). From a series of 14,967 chorionic villus samplings performed in our Fetal Medicine Center, 10 non-mosaic type 3 confined placental mosaicisms were identified. These abnormalities only involved chromosomes 15, 16 or 22. Pregnancies complicated by these confined placental mosaicisms were associated with prematurity and neonatal hypotrophy. Thus, when a confined placental mosaicism is suspected, this retrospective study highlighted the need to characterize the type of confined placental mosaicism to prevent the probable intra-uterine growth retardation and to adapt the obstetrical monitoring if necessary.
