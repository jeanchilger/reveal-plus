Prenatal diagnosis of mosaicism for 11q terminal deletion. The phenotype of 11q terminal deletion also known as Jacobsen syndrome is a clinically well known entity whose diagnosis in infancy and childhood is based on clinical examination, hematological and cytogenetic findings. Hematological features in Jacobsen syndrome are very similar to those reported in Paris-Trousseau syndrome (PTS) which is also associated with11q terminal deletion. Karyotype analysis shows a variable terminal deletion from 11q23 sub-band extending to the telomere. Most often in patients with Jacobsen syndrome, this chromosomal deletion is present in all metaphases. We report on the identification of a distal 11q deletion in mosaic (20% of deleted cells) in a fetus ascertained after amniocentesis for maternal serum screening test indicative for Down syndrome. The present case is the third prenatal diagnosis of a mosaic for a distal 11q deletion with the lowest mosaicism rate. The 2D-ultrasound examination and cord blood hematological studies were useful to estimate the prognosis at term, considering the contribution of the mosaicism rate to the phenotypic variability in Jacobsen syndrome. The identification of mosaicism for distal 11q deletion is a very rare event in prenatal diagnosis. This case illustrates the complexity in genetic counselling for prenatally ascertained partial monosomy 11qter in mosaic.
