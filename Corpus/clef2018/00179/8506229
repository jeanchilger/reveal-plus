A prospective cytogenetic study of third-trimester placentae in small-for-date but otherwise normal newborns. Data in the literature suggest that confined placental mosaicism might be associated with intrauterine growth retardation. However, this association may be coincidental and due to bias of ascertainment. We therefore started a prospective study based on the cytogenetic evaluation of placentae derived from growth-retarded newborns. We further minimized possible bias by excluding those small-for-date infants displaying findings which already could explain intrauterine growth retardation (mothers who are smokers, multiple pregnancies, gestosis, dysmorphic infants). In a collection of 71 small-for-gestational age newborns, we did not see a single case of true confined placental mosaicism.
