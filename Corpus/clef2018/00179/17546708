Impact of chromosomal abnormalities on preimplantation embryo development. To evaluate the influence of numerical chromosomal abnormalities on preimplantation embryo development.This study includes 6936 embryos from 1245 women undergoing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Indications for aneuploidy screening were: recurrent miscarriages, implantation failure, severe male factor, advanced maternal age, and mixed causes. Embryo biopsy was performed on day 3, and embryos were co-cultured until day 5, when embryo transfer was performed.In the aneuploidy screening regimen, normal euploid embryos showed significantly higher blastocyst rates (68.2%) compared to chromosomally abnormal (42.8%, p < 0.0001) and mosaic (53.7%, p < 0.0001) embryos. Among aneuploid embryos for autosomes, higher blastocyst rates were observed in trisomies than monosomies, although only statistically significant in patients over 36 years of age (50.8 vs 38.9% p < 0.0001). In contrast, in embryos with sex chromosomes aneuploidy, similar blastocyst rates were observed between trisomies and monosomy X.Embryos with certain types of chromosomal abnormalities were negatively selected during preimplantation embryo development. Despite this selection, a remarkable percentage of chromosomally abnormal embryos can develop normally to blastocyst stage with high probability of implantation and pregnancy.
