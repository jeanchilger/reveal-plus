Clinical first-trimester routine screening for Down syndrome in singleton pregnancies in northern Finland. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of both separate and combined maternal serum testing and fetal nuchal translucency measurement in the first trimester screening for Down syndrome in northern Finland.The following screening tests were evaluated: measurement of nuchal translucency (NT) alone serum screening (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A [PAPP-A] and free beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) aloneThe participants comprised 7534 pregnant women during the 10+0-12+6 weeks of pregnancy. All 7534 women participated in serum screening, and 4765 women participated in combined screening. In the serum screening-alone group, there were 30 cases of trisomy 21, of which 23 (76%) were detected. In the combined-screening group, there were 24 cases of trisomy 21 and 21 (87.5%) were detected. In the combined-screening group NT alone detected 15 cases of Down syndrome (62%).Combined screening is the method of choice for Down syndrome screening.
