Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 2 and confined placental mosaicism for trisomy 2 in a fetus with intrauterine growth restriction, hypospadias, and oligohydramnios. We present a case of maternal uniparental heterodisomy for chromosome 2 (UPD 2) detected after trisomy 2 mosaicism was found on placental biopsy. This case presented prenatally with severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and oligohydramnios. The diploid newborn had hypospadias and features consistent with oligohydramnios sequence. He died shortly after birth of severe pulmonary hypoplasia. The term placenta had high levels of trisomy 2 in both the trophoblast and the stroma. A comparison of this case with others reported in the literature suggests that the IUGR and oligohydramnios are likely related to placental insufficiency due to the high levels of trisomy 2 present in the trophoblast of the term placenta and the presence of UPD 2 in the diploid placental line.
