Low levels of amniotic fluid pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoprotein in Down's syndrome. Amniotic fluid levels of beta-1-glycoprotein (SP1) were measured in 46 cases of Down's syndrome and compared with levels in 106 pregnancies of normal karyotype from 10 to 23 weeks of gestation. In normal pregnancies, levels rose from 87.5 iu/l at 10 weeks to a peak of 610.0 iu/l at 19 weeks of gestation. In cases of Down's syndrome, levels were reduced prior to 19 weeks of gestation (median multiple of the median, MoM = 0.75, P = 0.02). This effect was most marked prior to 16 weeks of gestation when the median multiple of the median (MoM) was 0.51 (P = 0.006). These data demonstrate that amniotic fluid levels of SP1 are low in Down's syndrome before 19 weeks of gestation.
