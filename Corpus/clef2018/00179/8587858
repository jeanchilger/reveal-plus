Isolating fetal nucleated red blood cells from maternal blood: the Baylor experience--1995. In our previous work we have isolated fetal cells from maternal blood and used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for chromosome-specific probes to detect aneuploidy. Current efforts in the Baylor College of Medicine programme are focusing on obtaining consistency in flow-sorting methodology and on determining sensitivity and specificity. To this end, systematic evaluation of five glycophorin A (gly A) antibodies all produced agglutination, leading us to abandon the use of gly A antibodies for positive selection of fetal cells. Conversely, we have found LDS-751 to be useful for nuclear selection. CD45 negative selection can best be accomplished by the use of flasks coated with goat antibodies against mouse antibodies. Positive selection by flow sorting for either CD71+ cells or gamma-globin-positive cells seems to be successful. Using these two approaches, we have recently detected male (fetal) cells in pregnancies in which the fetus was 46,XY in 10 of 18 and in 12 of 14 cases, respectively.
