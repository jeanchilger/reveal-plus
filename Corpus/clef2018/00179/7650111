The use of first polar bodies for preimplantation diagnosis of aneuploidy. A large proportion of patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) are aged > or = 35 years. It has been estimated that in this age group, 50% of embryos are chromosomally abnormal, with aneuploidy being the major contributing factor. Since the origin of most aneuploidies is maternal meiosis I non-disjunction, unfertilized oocytes could be safely screened for aneuploidy by analysing their first polar bodies. To determine the feasibility of first polar body aneuploidy analysis, polar bodies were analyzed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using probes simultaneously for chromosomes X, Y, 18, 13/21 or X, Y, 18 and 16. Within 6 h of retrieval, 88% showed a normal segregation involving a single chromosome of each kind, with double-dotted hybridization signals, corresponding to dyads (chromosomes in metaphase I composed of two chromatids). The rest showed non-disjunction of full dyads (6%), or an unbalanced pre-division of dyads (6%), which gives a segregation of one chromatid or one dyad and a chromatid with the first polar body. But only 34% of polar bodies analysed 24 h after retrieval or later showed a normal segregation, with most of the other polar bodies showing balanced pre-division, with two separated hybridization signals for all the chromosomes analysed. The rates of non-disjunction and unbalanced pre-division after > or = 24 h in culture were similar to the rates in fresh oocytes. When both types of aneuploidy were considered together, an increase of aneuploidy with maternal age was detected, which although slight, was significant (P = 0.025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
