Prognosis of fetuses with a cystic hygroma. This paper reports our experience with 55 fetuses identified in utero to have a cystic hygroma. The outcome of fetuses with an isolated cystic hygroma, cystic hygroma with non-immune hydrops, and cystic hygroma with multiple anomalies was evaluated. Approximately two-thirds of karyotypes were aneuploid, and a strong association of septation and aneuploidy existed. Only five cases, four of which had isolated hygromas, came to term and resulted in live births. Two of these involved small non-septated lesions which resolved in utero.
