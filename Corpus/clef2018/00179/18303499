The use of prenatal ultrasound for the detection of fetal aneuploidy. Ultrasound is a noninvasive tool for early evaluation of the fetus and intrauterine environment. Its limitations include the lack of standardization of evaluation that patients receive, as well as varying sonologist's experience and equipment. Further, many fetuses with aneuploidy will not demonstrate significant sonographic findings, making detection limited. With regard to aneuploidy screening, its utility is improved when used in conjunction with analyte screening. Early recognition of fetal compromise allows families time for preparation and informed management of the gestation.
