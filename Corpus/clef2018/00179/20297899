Occult inflammation and/or ischemia may be responsible for the false positivity of biochemical Down syndrome screening test. To determine the possible underlying cause of a false-positive first or second trimester biochemical Down syndrome screening test result by means of second trimester amniotic fluid cytokine level analysis.A total of 74 consecutive patients undergoing amniocentesis for karyotype analysis at 16-20 weeks' gestation were included in this prospective age-matched case-control study. The study group (n=38) had abnormal first or second trimester screening test results and normal karyotype results, while controls (n=36) included those admitted for genetic amniocentesis for other reasons who had normal first or second trimester screening test and normal karyotype results. Four markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA)] were studied in amniotic fluid.The mean age of the women in the study and control groups was 34.0+/-5.6 and 33.6+/-7.2 years, respectively. The women in the study and control groups had similar clinical and laboratory characteristics. The mean amniotic fluid IL-6 (414.84+/-83.96 vs. 343.02+/-110.59, p=0.002) and IL-8 (377.61+/-243.31 vs. 261.90+/-201.29, p=0.029), TNF-alpha (24.91+/-5.78 vs. 21.60+/-5.55, p=0.014), and IMA (1.19+/- 0.10 vs. 1.05+/-0.12, p<0.001) values were significantly increased in the study group when compared to controls.The higher amniotic fluid cytokine and ischemia-modified albumin levels in patients with false-positive first or second trimester biochemical Down syndrome screening test may result from subclinical fetal membrane inflammation and/or ischemia.
