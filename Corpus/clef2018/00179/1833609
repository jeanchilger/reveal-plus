Ethical considerations relating to prenatal diagnosis of fetuses with Down syndrome. Advances in prenatal diagnoses of genetic and chromosome disorders have brought about numerous legal and ethical concerns. There are many proponents of prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion of affected fetuses who indicate that such procedures benefit society and the family as well as constitute "good" preventive medicine. Arguments against aborting affected fetuses have been proposed by people who look upon human life, including fetal life, as precious and valuable. They feel that physical and intellectual impairments are not valid reasons to recommend pregnancy termination. Prospective parents of affected fetuses with a chromosome disorder such as Down syndrome must be provided with all pertinent information, appropriate counseling, and support.
