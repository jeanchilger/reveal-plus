Prenatal sex diagnosis: testosterone and FSH levels in mid-trimester amniotic fluids. We studied the validity of mid-trimester amniotic fluid testosterone and FSH in the diagnosis of fetal sex in abnormal fetuses and in twins. It was found that the testosterone/FSH ratio, but not the level of the individual hormones, was an excellent criterion for fetal sex diagnosis. In a control group of 32 female and 34 male fetuses, the testosterone/FSH ratio was diagnostic. In two cases the values were indeterminate and fetal sex could not be predicted, but there were no false diagnoses. The abnormalities of the fetuses were diagnosed by karyotype analyses or raised levels of alpha-fetoprotein. It was found that neither autosomal trisomies nor X-chromosome aneuploidy or neural tube defect interfered with the diagnostic value of the hormonal approach. The twin study included 14 pairs, three of whom were discordant for sex. In all twins the fetal sex diagnosis was appropriate. In co-twins of the same sex the hormone levels were very close to each other.
