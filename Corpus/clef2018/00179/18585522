First- and second-trimester thyroid hormone reference data in pregnant women: a FaSTER (First- and Second-Trimester Evaluation of Risk for aneuploidy) Research Consortium study. The purpose of this study was to calculate first and second trimester reference ranges and within-woman correlations for TSH, free T4, and thyroid antibodies.TSH, free T4, and thyroid antibodies were measured in paired sera from 9562 women in the FaSTER trial of Down syndrome screening.The median first trimester TSH (1.05 mIU/L) is lower than the second (1.23 mIU/L) and 98th centile is higher (4.15 vs 3.77 mIU/L). Within-woman paired TSH correlations are moderately strong (r(2) = 0.64). Among women with first trimester TSH values above the 98th centile, second trimester values are over the 95th centile in 68%. Median first trimester free T4 values (1.10 ng/dL) are higher than second (1.01 ng/dL). Paired free T4 measurements correlate weakly (r(2) = 0.23). Among women with first trimester free T4 values below the 2nd centile, second trimester values are below the 5th centile in 32%. Antibody measurements correlate strongly between trimesters (thyroperoxidase r(2) = 0.79, thyroglobulin r(2) = 0.83).TSH and free T4 measurements require gestation-specific reference ranges.
