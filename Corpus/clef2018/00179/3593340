High molecular weight Alzheimer's disease amyloid peptide immunoreactivity in human serum and CSF is an immunoglobulin G. A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was developed to detect the 4200 Dalton amyloid (A4) peptide or it's precursor (A4P) in human serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A synthetic peptide containing the first 28 amino acids of the 43 amino acid A4 peptide was covalently coupled to bovine thyroglobulin and a polyclonal antiserum in rabbits was prepared. This antiserum was specific for vascular amyloid and neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease brain as detected by immunoperoxidase. The synthetic peptide, which has a tyrosine at residue 10, was iodinated with chloramine T and [125I]iodine and was purified to homogeneity by C4 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Extraction of human serum over a C18 Sep Pak cartridge indicated immunoreactive A4 peptide was not detectable in human serum. Conversely, high molecular weight A4 peptide immunoreactivity was detectable in human serum, at a concentration of 8.9 +/- 1.2 pmol-eq./ml, and in human CSF, at a concentration of 0.25 +/- 0.01 pmol-eq./ml, giving a CSF/serum ratio of 3.2%. The immunoreactivity in human serum was nearly completely removed by affinity deletion of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), but not by affinity removal of IgA or IgM. Serum immunoreactivity was decreased 90% in hypogammaglobulinemia, and was increased 83% in human cord serum. There was no statistical difference in serum A4 immunoreactivity in Alzheimer's serum or CSF. Serum immunoreactivity in Down's syndrome was increased 50%. These studies indicate the high molecular weight A4P immunoreactivity in human serum or CSF is an IgG. Whether the A4 precursor in Alzheimer's disease is, in fact, an IgG, or whether there is an antibody in human serum and CSF that cross reacts with the A4 precursor cannot be determined until the serum immunoreactivity is purified and structurally characterized.
