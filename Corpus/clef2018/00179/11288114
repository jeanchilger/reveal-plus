Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for rapid detection of aneuploidy: experience in 911 prenatal cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed with probes specific for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y on 911 of 11123 (8.2%) amniotic fluid samples submitted to the present authors' laboratory for cytogenetic analysis over an 8-year period. Altogether 3516 hybridizations were performed with an interpretable FISH result on all chromosomes requested in 884/911 (97%) of cases. An uninformative FISH result occurred in 44 hybridizations among 27 cases (3%). Of a total of 89 karyotypically proven cases with aneuploidy that might have been detected by FISH, the overall detection rate was 84%. An inconclusive or incomplete FISH result occurred in 9/89 (10%) of these proven aneuploid cases. In the remaining 80 informative proven aneuploid cases, correct detection of aneuploidy was accomplished in 75/80 (94%) of samples. A false-negative result occurred in the remaining 5/80 (6%) of such informative cases. Eighteen cases had karyotypically proven abnormalities that could not have been detected by the targeted FISH. Aside from these 18 cases, FISH allowed correct detection of normal disomy in 785/804 (98%) of such cases. An incomplete FISH result occurred in 18 normal disomic cases. There was a single possible 'false-positive' FISH result for chromosome 21. Interphase FISH analysis of uncultured amniotic fluid cells has been shown to be a useful laboratory tool for rapid fetal aneuploidy screening during pregnancy. As with all clinical laboratory diagnostic tests, incomplete or inconclusive results (or even interpretive errors) occur in a small percentage of cases. Nevertheless, FISH results accompanied by other data and by appropriate counseling provide clinicians and patients with valuable information for clinical decision-making surrounding family planning and pregnancy management.
