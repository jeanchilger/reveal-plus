Detection of aneuploidy with digital polymerase chain reaction. The widespread use of genetic testing in high-risk pregnancies has created strong interest in rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics for common chromosomal aneuploidies. We show here that digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) can be used for accurate measurement of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), the most common human aneuploidy. dPCR is generally applicable to any aneuploidy, does not depend on allelic distribution or gender, and is able to detect signals in the presence of mosaics or contaminating maternal DNA.
