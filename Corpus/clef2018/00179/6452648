Relationship between minor physical anomalies, perinatal complications, and psychiatric diagnoses in children. Thirty-three preterm infants of low birth weight, 18 full-term infants of low birth weight, and 52 full-term infants of normal birth weight were evaluated at ages 9 to 11 years for psychiatric diagnoses and for minor physical anomalies. Mothers completed various child behavior questionnaires. Analysis of variance of the mean anomaly scores revealed that significant differences in the scores were due to the presence or absence of perinatal complications other than low birth weight and preterm delivery. Significant differences were also related to the presence or absence of at least one psychiatric diagnosis. The variables of perinatal complications and psychiatric diagnoses seemed to be acting independently of each other. The minor physical anomaly scores also correlated significantly with Conners Parent-Teacher Questionnaire scores for hyperactivity in both the full-term normal birth weight group and the preterm low birth weight group.
