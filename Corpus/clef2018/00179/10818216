Formation of uniparental disomy 7 delineated from new cases and a UPD7 case after trisomy 7 rescue. Presentation of own results and review of the literature. Maternal uniparental disomy for the entire chromosome 7 (matUPD7) has been reported several times in Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) and growth-restricted patients. Here we present our results from the analysis of an abortion with confined placental mosaicism (CPM) for trisomy 7 which showed a maternal meiotic origin of the trisomy in the placenta and rescue to maternal UPD7 in foetal membrane. Furthermore, two newly detected SRS cases with maternal UPD7 revealed isodisomy and partial heterodisomy, respectively. Summarising these results with those published previously on the origin of UPD7, similar numbers of isodisomy (n=11) and cases with complete or partial heterodisomy (n=12) have been reported. In respect to the different formation mechanisms of UPD, complete isodisomy should be the result of a post-zygotic mitotic segregation error, whereas heterodisomic UPDs should be caused by trisomic rescue after meiotic non-disjunction events. In maternal UPD7, 50% of cases seem to be caused by post-zygotic mitotic segregation errors, which is similar to the situation in trisomy 7. This result corresponds to the situation in trisomy 8 but is in contrast to observations in the frequent aneuploidies. Thus, the different findings in these aberrations reflect the presence of multiple factors that act to ensure normal segregation, varying in importance for each chromosome.
