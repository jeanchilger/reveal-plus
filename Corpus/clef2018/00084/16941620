Absolute quantification of myocardial perfusion under adenosine stress. The prebolus technique allows one to quantify perfusion in the human heart with a low variability by means of MRI. In this study the prebolus technique was used to determine quantitative perfusion values in the human heart under adenosine stress and to measure the myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR). Twelve healthy volunteers were examined using the multislice prebolus technique with 1/4 cc Gd-BOPTA. Signal intensity (SI) time courses were evaluated in 288 manually segmented sectors at rest and stress. Myocardial perfusion was determined by deconvolution of the SI time courses with the arterial input function (AIF) from the prebolus scan. The mean stress perfusion value was 1.78 +/- 0.53 cc/g/min, and the mean rest perfusion was 0.52 +/- 0.11 cc/g/min, resulting in a mean MPR of 3.59 +/- 1.26. The measured values correlate well with data from animal models and human positron emission tomography (PET) studies.
