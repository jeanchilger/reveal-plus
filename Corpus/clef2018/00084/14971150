Positron-emission tomography in oncology. This review analyses clinical results, new trends and recommendations of the leading medical centers concerning application of positron-emission tomography (PET) with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F18 FDG) in cancer patients. This method of radionuclide visualization has been widely introduced for the last decade in diagnosis of cancer of unknown primary location, or CUP-syndrome, bronchogenic cancer of the lungs, cancer of the head and neck, malignant lymphoma and melanoma, colorectal and neuroendocrine cancer. Efficacy of this procedure, physiological grounds, performance are considered. Potentialities of F18 FDG PET are demonstrated in tumor screening, detection of metastases, recurrences after surgical, radiation or drug antitumor treatment or monitoring. In combination with CT, MRT, USI and other techniques, F18 FDG PET raises accuracy of the diagnosis of pathological changes at any stage of cancer with resulting improvement in further therapeutic and follow-up efficacy.
