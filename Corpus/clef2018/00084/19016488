Acute and chronic effects of citalopram on 5-HT1A receptor-labeling by [18F]MPPF and -coupling to receptors-G proteins. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors take several weeks to produce their maximal therapeutic antidepressant effect. This delay has been attributed to the gradual desensitization of somatodendritic serotonin 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. We evaluated adaptive changes of 5-HT(1A) receptors after acute and chronic citalopram challenges in rat. Small animal positron emission tomography trial and quantitative ex vivo autoradiography studies using [(18)F]MPPF were employed, as well as in vitro 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assay. Additionally, 5-HT(1A) receptor knock-out mice were used to assess the specificity of [(18)F]MPPF. Acute treatment with citalopram did not alter [(18)F]MPPF binding in dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), frontal cortex, or hippocampus. The absence of [(18)F]MPPF binding in the brain of 5-HT(1A) knock-out mice demonstrates the specificity of MPPF for 5-HT(1A) receptor brain imaging, but the high affinity of [(18)F]MPPF compared to 5-HT suggests that it would only be displaced by dramatic increases in extracellular 5-HT. Chronic citalopram did not modify 5-HT(1A) receptor density in any of the brain regions studied. In addition, this treatment did not modify 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding in DR, although a significant increase was observed in frontal cortex and hippocampus. [(18)F]MPPF appears to be an efficient radioligand to quantify specifically 5-HT(1A) receptor density in brain imaging. The delayed therapeutic efficacy of citalopram did not appear to be linked to either a downregulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors or to a 5-HT(1A) receptor-G protein decoupling process in serotonergic neurons, but to increased functional sensitivity of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors.
