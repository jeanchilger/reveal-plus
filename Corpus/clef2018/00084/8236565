Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of acute cerebral infarctions. Eight patients with brain infarction were examined serially in the acute phase and one week and two to four weeks after stroke with water-suppressed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls. The time courses of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), total creatine (Cr), choline containing compounds (Cho), lactate content, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured by SPECT were studied. A high lactate level was found in the acute phase. The lactate content decreased to barely detectable levels during the following two to four weeks, while rCBF increased during this period. The content of NAA in infarcted tissue was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) compared to healthy controls, Cr was also reduced (p < 0.02), whereas Cho content did not change. The inverse relationship between lactate level and cerebral blood flow suggests that lactate plays no substantial role in the vasodilatation underlying the hyperaemia that follows reperfusion. The amount of lactate present in the acute phase reflects the severity of ischaemia in the affected region. The content of NAA may be used as a neuronal marker, and thus perhaps as a marker of the effect of future treatment procedures.
