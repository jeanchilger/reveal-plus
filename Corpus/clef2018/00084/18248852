The selective amobarbital test in the anterior choroidal artery: perfusion pattern assessed by intraarterial SPECT and prediction of postoperative verbal memory. To screen for patients at risk for memory decline after temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery, selective amobarbital procedures, such as injection into the anterior choroidal artery (ACA-IAT), are sometimes used. We investigated the extent of the territory affected during ACA-IAT and its predictive value with respect to postoperative memory. Seventeen patients with TLE underwent ACA-IAT. In 9 of 17 patients, intraarterial SPECT co-registrated to MRI allowed delineation of amobarbital-perfused structures. Another subgroup of 9 of 17 patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy. Verbal memory was tested pre- and postoperatively and during ACA-IAT. Major variations in the ACA-IAT perfusion pattern occurred and were not correlated with the verbal memory scores during ACA-IAT. Postoperatively, no patient experienced a severe verbal memory decline, but individual postoperative performance was not correlated with results during ACA-IAT. Our study suggests that ACA-IAT can be used to screen for severe postoperative amnesia in inconclusive cases, but cannot predict individual outcome, even when the perfusion pattern is taken into account.
