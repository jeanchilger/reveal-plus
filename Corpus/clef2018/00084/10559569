Dementia with leukoaraiosis: clinical differentiation by temporoparietal hypometabolism on (18)FDG-PET imaging. Patients with dementia and leukoaraiosis may have either Alzheimer's disease (AD) with cerebrovascular changes or a form of vascular dementia (VaD). The presence or absence of the characteristic AD pattern of bilateral temporoparietal hypometabolism on (18)FDG-PET was used to differentiate 30 patients with progressive dementia and severe leukoaraiosis. Compared to 18 patients with the typical AD pattern (group I), the remaining 12 (group II) had better recognition memory, and greater difficulty with sustained attention and serial reversals. Better recognition memory, confluent periventricular leukoaraiosis, and poorer sustained attention distinguished all group II patients from group I. Dementia patients with severe leukoaraiosis and bilateral temporoparietal hypometabolism may have predominant AD those who lack this pattern and have confluent leukoaraiosis may have a greater contribution from VaD.
