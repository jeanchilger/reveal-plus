PET imaging of lung tumours and mediastinal lymphoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) of the lung is evaluated regarding its clinical practicability for staging of bronchogenic carcinomas and lymphomas. Stringent quality control, optimized acquisition and reconstruction techniques are of crucial importance. An analysis of 50 PET studies for tumour (T) and lymphnode (N) staging in comparison to CT shows that PET has the highest diagnostic accuracy to classify lesions and is the most promising technique for non-invasive staging. PET cannot be the first imaging modality, but if unnecessary or invasive procedures can be avoided, the additional expense of a PET study seems justified.
