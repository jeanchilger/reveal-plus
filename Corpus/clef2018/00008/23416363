17β-Estradiol and steady-state concentrations of H2O2: antiapoptotic effect in endometrial cells from patients with endometriosis. Increased levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can initiate protective responses to limit or repair oxidative damage. However, H2O2 signals also fine-tune responses to growth factors and cytokines controlling cell division, differentiation, and proliferation. Because 17β-estradiol (E2) also plays important roles in these processes, and is considered a major risk factor in the development and progression of endometriosis, this study evaluated whether E2 has an antiapoptotic effect on oxidative stress in endometrial cells in combination with steady-state H2O2 levels ([H2O2]ss). Endometrial stromal cells were prepared from the eutopic endometrium of 18 women with and without endometriosis to produce primary cells. These cells were stimulated with E2 for 20h, exposed to [H2O2]ss, and examined for cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis. The endometrial cells from women with endometriosis maintained the steady state for 120min at high H2O2 concentrations. When they were pretreated with E2 and exposed to [H2O2]ss, a decrease in apoptosis level was observed compared to the control cells (p<0.01). The endometrial cells from patients with endometriosis subjected to both E2 and [H2O2]ss showed increased ERK phosphorylation. These findings suggested that H2O2 is a signaling molecule that downregulates apoptosis in endometrial cells, supporting the fact that endometriosis, albeit a benign disease, shares some features with cancer such as decreased catalase levels. These results link the E2 effects on [H2O2]ss to resistance to apoptosis and progression of endometriosis.
