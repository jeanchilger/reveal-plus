A Hemodynamically Significant Patent Ductus Arteriosus Does Not Affect Cerebral or Renal Tissue Oxygenation in Preterm Infants. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is common in preterm infants and is associated with significant morbidity. To determine whether the PDA is hemodynamically significant (HSDA), several echocardiographic parameters have been suggested, including retrograde diastolic blood flow in the descending aorta (Dao).To assess the impact of an HSDA, including retrograde diastolic flow in the Dao, on regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) and extraction measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).This is a prospective observational cohort study in which we included preterm infants (GA <32 weeks) who underwent echocardiographic screening because of clinical signs of an HSDA within 2 weeks after birth. We measured cerebral and renal rSO2 on the day of echocardiography. HSDA was diagnosed if left-to-right shunting through the PDA was accompanied by left atrial-to-aortic root ratio >1.4 and/or left pulmonary artery end-diastolic flow velocity >0.2 m/s and/or retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao.Forty-nine infants were included, with a median GA of 27.6 weeks (IQR: 26.1-29.0), birth weight of 980 g (IQR: 800-1,200), and postnatal age of 77 h (IQR: 70-107). Infants with a closed duct (n = 11), a non-HSDA (n = 18), and an HSDA (n = 20) had similar cerebral and renal NIRS measurements. Retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao, present in 11 infants with PDA, also did not affect cerebral and renal NIRS measurements.In preterm infants with clinical signs of an HSDA within 2 weeks after birth, cerebral and renal oxygen saturation and extraction are not affected by an HSDA or by retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao.
