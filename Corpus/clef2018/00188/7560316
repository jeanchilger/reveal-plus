Three-dimensional fast spin echo T1-weighted imaging of the pediatric spine. We evaluated the feasibility of using a three-dimensional (3D) fast SE (FSE) pulse sequence to acquire T1-weighted (T1W) images of the pediatric spine.The 3D FSE T1W images were acquired in nine pediatric patients undergoing spine MRI for different clinical indications. The 3D FSE images were compared with our standard 2D SE T1W images.Image contrast was comparable between the two sequences. The 3D FSE sequence produced contiguous thin sections that allowed multiplanar reformations not possible with the 2D SE sequence.3D T1W spine imaging with conventional SE-like contrast is feasible with 3D FSE.
