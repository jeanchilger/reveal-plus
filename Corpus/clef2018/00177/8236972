Prenatal diagnosis using fetal cells from the maternal circulation. All current methods of fetal karyotyping are invasive and carry a definite, albeit small, procedure-related risk. Because of this and testing costs, only women older than 35 years who have a greater risk for fetal aneuploidy are currently offered prenatal testing. But this detects only 20% to 25% of fetuses with Down syndrome. It would be a tremendous advance to find a noninvasive technique for prenatal diagnosis that carries no procedure-related risk and could be offered to all pregnant women. We describe a possible technique for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis that aims to identify fetal cells in the peripheral maternal circulation and successfully garner them for prenatal testing. Early attempts at fetal karyotyping were hampered by inaccurate diagnostic methods and cumbersome cell-counting techniques. Today, improved capabilities of identifying and enriching for fetal cells, coupled with sensitive methods of analysis such as the polymerase chain reaction, bring renewed enthusiasm to this task. Many technical issues, as well as serious questions regarding the test's utility, still exist, however, and must be explored and answered before the capture of fetal cells in the maternal circulation translates into reality for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis.
