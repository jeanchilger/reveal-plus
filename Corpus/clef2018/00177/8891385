Parental origin and mechanisms of formation of three cases of 12p tetrasomy. Pallister-Killian syndrome is a clinically recognizable syndrome characterized by tissue-limited mosaicism for an extra 12p isochromosome. Very little is known about the underlying mechanism of this rare rearrangement. Microsatellite markers were studied from three fetuses with Pallister-Killian syndrome and their parents to determine the parent of origin and the cell division yielding the additional isochromosome. In two cases the isochromosome contained the same allele(s) as a normal transmitted chromosome 12, one paternal and one maternal in origin. A third case showed inheritance of two different maternal alleles, indicating that at least one meiotic error was involved in the ultimate formation of the extra isochromosome.
