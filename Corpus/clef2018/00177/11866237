Current concepts in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): a molecular biologist's view. The first clinically applied preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) was reported more than a decade ago and since then PGD has known an exponential growth. This first report described the use of PCR to sex embryos from couples at risk for X-linked diseases. Not surprisingly, in the first years, the development of PCR-based tests led to PGD for well-known monogenic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and thalassaemia. When fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) was introduced it quickly replaced PCR-based methods, which had led to misdiagnoses, for sexing of embryos. FISH was also quickly introduced for aneuploidy screening, which has as its main aim the improvement of IVF results in patients with poor reproductive outcome, and later for PGD in translocation carriers. In this review, PGD for patients with a pre-existing genetic risk will be discussed, i.e. the monogenic diseases and the translocations, as well as different biopsy methods and promising new developments.
