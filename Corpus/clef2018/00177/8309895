Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 9 mosaicism: two new cases. We present two prenatal cases of trisomy 9 mosaicism, both of which presented intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and other abnormal ultrasound findings. In case A, mosaicism was found in amniotic fluid cell cultures, of which 65 per cent were trisomic cells, on average. In case B, trisomic cells were present in amniotic fluid cell cultures (12 per cent) but none were found in fetal cord blood. After autopsy, cytogenetic findings were confirmed in different tissue cultures. It is concluded that echographic indicators are a very useful tool for a correct prenatal diagnostic interpretation of trisomy 9. Suspected trisomy 9 mosaicism always requires further investigation and fetal cord blood cytogenetic analysis may not be considered as providing an accurate diagnosis of fetal trisomy 9.
