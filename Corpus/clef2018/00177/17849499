Chromosome topology in normal and aneuploid blastomeres from human embryos. To find whether chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y in blastomeres of human embryos are nonrandomly localized, whether their aneuploidy affects their localization and if eventual early inactivation of chromosome X with peripheral localization is present.Relative distances from the nucleus center and edge of 1,198 fluorescence in situ hybridization signals in 98 human blastomeres were measured in digital images for comparison with a mathematical model of random distribution in spherical nucleus.Comparison with the mathematical model revealed that localization of chromosomes 13, 16, 21, 22, X and Y in normal and aneuploid blastomeres and that of chromosome 18 in normal blastomeres was not significantly different from random distribution. Similarly, chromosome X in blastomeres with more than one X did not appear to have a preferential localization. Only chromosome 18 in aneuploid blastomeres was differently distributed (p < 0.0001) with a shift to the nuclear periphery (p =or < 0.0001).Peripheral localization of chromosome 18 in aneuploid blastomeres is related to embryo aneuploidy. Conversely, a peripheral localization of the inactive X chromosome was not found in blastomeres from 3-4 day old embryos. These results open the possibility to improve embryo selection after pre-implantation diagnosis.
