Measurement of inhibin A and activin A in pregnancy--possible diagnostic applications. Knowledge of the roles of inhibins and activins has progressed rapidly since the development of a specific and sensitive assay that can be used for measurements on human serum and amniotic fluid samples. There is a sound theoretical basis for the role of transforming growth factor-beta family members in inflammatory processes, many of which are analogous to implantation, parturition and a variety of pathological conditions in pregnancy. This review explores the potential use of assays for inhibins and activins in clinical practice and suggests further areas for research.
