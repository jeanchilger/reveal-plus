Prenatal diagnosis, fetal pathology and cytogenetic analysis of a 46,XX/47,XX, + 15 mosaic. Mosaic trisomy 15 was prenatally diagnosed on amniotic fluid cells from two consecutive amniocenteses and was confirmed on cells from five different fetal tissues. The proportion of normal versus trisomic cells was consistently higher in the amniotic cell cultures and--with one exception--in the fetal tissues, while serial subcultures gave different results. The slightly atypical external features and internal malformations of the affected fetus as compared to the only clinical observation from the literature are not unusual enough to allow the delineation of a specific malformation pattern.
