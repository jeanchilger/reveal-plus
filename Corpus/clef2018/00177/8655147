Distribution of mosaicism in human placentae. Traditional first trimester chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for prenatal diagnosis can be performed by cytogenetic analysis of cytotrophoblast or chorionic villous stroma. Approximately 2% of pregnancies studied by CVS show confined placental mosaicism (CPM) involving either cytotrophoblast, stroma or both. We present the results of a cytogenetic study of nine term placentae from pregnancies with prenatally diagnosed CPM. The aneuploid++ cell lines involved trisomies for chromosomes 7,9,16, and X. The cytotrophoblast and villous stroma from multiple biopsies of these placentae were examined using a combination of interphase and metaphase cytogenetic analysis. CPM was detected in all nine of the term placentae and both tissue-specific and site-specific patterns of mosaicism could be discerned. These results indicate that the analysis of villous stroma and cytotrophoblast from multiple placental biopsies is necessary to improve our understanding of the evolution of CPM during pregnancy and its effect on the fetus.
