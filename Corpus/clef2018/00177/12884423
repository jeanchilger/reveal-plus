Prenatal detection of mosaic trisomy 1q due to an unbalanced translocation in one fetus of a twin pregnancy following in vitro fertilization: a postzygotic error. Complete or mosaic trisomy for all of chromosome 1q has been seen rarely in a recognized pregnancy. A patient presented with twins following in vitro fertilization (IVF). Ultrasound showed twin A to have a diaphragmatic hernia, thick nuchal fold, and subtle intracranial abnormalities. Twin B appeared normal and a thick dividing membrane was seen. Amniocentesis of twin A showed a male karyotype with mosaic trisomy 1q in 57% of cells resulting from a translocation between chromosomes Yq12 and 1q12. Parental karyotypes were normal. The twins were delivered at 33 weeks. Twin A died at 1 hr of life. Autopsy confirmed the left diaphragmatic hernia and hypoplastic lungs. Autopsy also revealed a partial cleft palate, syndactyly of the second and third toes bilaterally, external deviation of the left 5th toe, and contractures of the index fingers bilaterally. A recent report documented formation of a chimera resulting from embryo amalgamation after IVF. Given the rarity of the cytogenetic findings in our case, we sought to determine if the mosaicism was a result of chimera formation related to the IVF. Thirteen polymorphic loci throughout the genome, in addition to four on 1q and four on 1p, were amplified by PCR. Only two alleles were observed at each of these loci in twin A, one paternal and the other maternal. We present further clinical findings of this case with a rare cytogenetic abnormality that appears to have originated from a postzygotic mitotic error and not embryo amalgamation.
