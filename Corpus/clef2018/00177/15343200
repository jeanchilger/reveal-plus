Monozygotic twins with discordant karyotypes: a case report. A monochorionic twin pregnancy had normal male karyotype on chorionic villous sampling. At delivery, one twin presented as morphologically normal, the other as trisomy 21. A twinning event and chromosome division error shortly after conception resulted in monozygotic twins with discordant tissue karyotypes and blood chromosome chimerism for trisomy 21.
