The triple test scenario for Styria. With data of the Styria Abnormalities Register. The aim of the study was to clarify by a cost-effectiveness analysis, if a triple-marker screening for trisomy 21 (triple test) should be established in Austria.The published triple-test results of the last years were combined with the data of the Styrian Malformation Register covering the years 1985-1992. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on total costs of prenatal diagnosis, costs per fetus diagnosed as affected, the number of affected fetuses detected, and the number of procedure-related losses.If low costs are given priority, the triple test should be offered to women 35 years of age or older. If a high detection rate is given top priority, the test should be offered to all pregnant women.The results suggest that the present policy of maternal age screening in Austria should be replaced by maternal serum screening.
