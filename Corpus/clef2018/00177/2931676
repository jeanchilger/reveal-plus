A possible prenatal evaluation of renal function by amino acid analysis on fetal urine. Intrauterine treatment of 4 fetuses with urethral obstruction was attempted in the third trimester of pregnancy. The fetuses displayed varying sonographic findings including pyelectasis, caliectasis, hydroureter, bladder dilatation, ascites, hydrops, missing kidneys and oligohydramnios. Ultrasonically guided aspiration from the dilated structures was carried out to relieve pressure on the kidney parenchyme and to collect fluid samples for diagnostic purposes. Amino acid concentrations in the fetal urine showed a pattern similar to plasma in 2 fetuses, a pattern almost like urine in 1 fetus and an intermediate pattern in the 4th fetus. Only the fetus with normal amino acid concentrations in the urine survived: the other 3 died in uremia shortly after birth. In 3 cases cells from the aspirated urine were cultured and used for chromosome analysis. The cell cultures grew fast and karyotyping was possible within 1 week. In 2 fetuses an intrauterine catheter was inserted to drain the kidney permanently into the amniotic cavity. In the first case the catheter was displaced to the fetal abdomen after some days of successful drainage. In the second case the catheter tore the placenta, and the child had to be delivered immediately.
