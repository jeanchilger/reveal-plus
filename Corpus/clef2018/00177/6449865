Dermatoglyphic analysis of fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities. I applied Okajima's technique of exposing the dermal surface by chemical and mechanical treatment followed by toluidine blue stain to inspect the dermatoglyphic features of hands of aborted human fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities. The dermatoglyphic patterns of five fetuses, three with Down syndrome, one with 5p--, and one with 18 trisomy, were analyzed to determine whether the patterns were sufficiently specific to be used for diagnostic purposes. Apparently unique patterns were obtained. Observation of the dermal surface suggested that the developmental sequence of the ridges in fetuses with chromosomal disorders was retarded by more than 2 weeks as compared with that of normal fetuses of th same gestation.
