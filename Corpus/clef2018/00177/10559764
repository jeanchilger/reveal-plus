Down syndrome: perinatal complications and counseling experiences in 216 patients. Two hundred and sixteen infant evaluations were selected for analysis from those of 669 outpatients (930 total visits) at a weekly Down syndrome clinic. Each record contained perinatal history and physical examination results, and 191 of the 216 included a systematic interview regarding parental experiences with diagnosis and counseling. Gastrointestinal problems (77% of neonates), cardiac anomalies (38%), and hematologic problems (11%) were the most common complications cited problems included anal stenosis (11%), which is described as a newly recognized cause of constipation in early infancy. Counseling experiences were positive in 66 (34%) of the 191 parent interviews, with counselor knowledge, timing, setting, and attitudes being cited as key factors. Appropriate counseling and surveillance for gastrointestinal problems can greatly facilitate parental adjustment to the neonate with Down syndrome.
