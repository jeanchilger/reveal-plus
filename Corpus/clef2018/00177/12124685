Prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease in the Naples area during the years 1994-1999 -- the experience of a joint fetal-pediatric cardiology unit. To analyse the spectrum and frequencies of observed malformations to evaluate associated extracardiac and chromosomal anomalies and outcomes in each diagnostic categoryFrom January 1994 to December 1999, 450 cases of CHD were detected among 4052 pregnancies at risk of fetal CHD seen at our combined unit. Confirmation of the diagnosis was not available in 50 cases, leaving 400 cases for analysis. From our computerized database, the following variables were retrieved and analysed: indication, gestational age at diagnosis, associated extracardiac anomalies, karyotype, natural history, pregnancy and feto-neonatal outcome.CHDs most commonly detected were VSD (75 cases), AVSD (40 cases) and HLH (37 cases). The aneuploidy rate was 29.3% in the 355 cases submitted for karyotyping (25.9% in the whole series), with a prevalence of trisomy 21 and 18 (48 and 30 cases, respectively). The aneuploidy rate was highest for AVSD (80%), coarctation (49%), tetralogy of Fallot and VSD (45%). Associated extracardiac anomalies were present in 29.5% of the cases (118/400). As for pregnancy outcome, there were 150 (37.5%) terminations of pregnancy, 16 (4%) intrauterine fetal deaths and 85 (21.3%) neonatal deaths. The remaining 149 neonates are alive (37.3% survival rate). The termination rate for pregnancies in which CHD was detected at a gestational age <25 weeks was 65.2%. Evolutive changes determined progressive prognostic deterioration in 21 cases (5%), consisting of semilunar valve obstructions and development of ventricular hypoplasia.The high association rate with extracardiac and chromosomal anomalies (29.3% and 25.9%) and the possible progressive prognostic deterioration require a multidisciplinary team for correct management and follow-up. Survival of fetuses with certain CHD is severely reduced, in comparison with postnatal figures, for the common association with aneuploidies.
