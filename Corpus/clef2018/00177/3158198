Factors influencing maternal estimates of genetic risk. The relationship between the objective and subjective estimates of genetic risk was studied in 202 women accepting and 50 women not accepting amniocentesis. All women were at risk of having a child with congenital anomalies either because of maternal age at pregnancy or family history of Down syndrome (DS) or other congenital anomalies. Only 28.6% of the women rejecting and 44.4% of the women accepting amniocentesis remembered correctly their objective odds. The correlations between the objective risk estimates and the subjective risk estimates were low overall (r = 0.089, p = 0.08) for women rejecting (r = 0.024, p = 0.44) or accepting (r = 0.082, p = 0.12) amniocentesis. The psychosocial and sociodemographic variables relating to either objective or subjective risk estimates were different for both groups of women. The study provides information on variables that should be taken into consideration in formulating a general theory to predict individual perceptions of genetic risk.
