Preimplantation genetic screening to improve in vitro fertilization pregnancy rates: a prospective randomized controlled trial. This prospective randomized controlled pilot trial was designed to evaluate whether prescreening embryos for aneuploidy can improve clinical outcomes in infertile patients undergoing IVF, without limiting to poor prognosis patients. Although there was no statistically significant improvement in live birth rates or implantation rates in this pilot study, there was a trend toward improved clinical outcomes, indicating that future multicenter randomized trials are needed.
