Diagnosis of polyhydramnios in early gestation: indication for prenatal diagnosis? Previously published reports have indicated that idiopathic polyhydramnios may be associated with trisomies 18 and 21 and that chromosomal analysis is indicated. Furthermore, the natural history and fetal outcome of polyhydramnios diagnosed in early gestation have not been well delineated. We identified 138 pregnancies with polyhydramnios prior to 26 weeks' gestation. Of 131 complete cases, 21 were diagnosed as severe, 18 as moderate, and 92 as mild polyhydramnios. Congenital abnormalities were noted in 18 of 21 severe cases (86 per cent). Two of the remaining three cases were twin-to-twin transfusion. Thirteen of 18 cases with moderate polyhydramnios (72 per cent) were associated with anomalies six of the remaining cases were twin-to-twin transfusion. Sixteen of 92 cases of mild polyhydramnios (17 per cent) were associated with congenital abnormalities. In 69 of 76 cases of mild hydramnios not associated with anomalies (91 per cent), the hydramnios resolved prior to delivery. Only 2 of 16 (13 per cent) associated with anomalies resolved. In 4 of 5 cases (80 per cent) with moderate hydramnios and no anomalies, the amniotic fluid volume was normal on subsequent ultrasound. No case of moderate polyhydramnios associated with anomalies or maternal conditions nor any case of severe polyhydramnios resolved. There were seven cases of chromosomal abnormalities in this series
