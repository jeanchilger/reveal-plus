Methylation profiling of the cell cycle regulating genes in placenta of human embryos with chromosomal mosaicism. To date the investigation of epigenetic mechanisms of cell cycle regulation, ensuring genomic stability maintaining and accurate transfer of hereditary information to daughter cells, is of a considerable interest. Development of the up-to-date molecular technologies allows determining methylation pattern of the whole genome at a single round of analysis. In this work for the first time the epigenetic status of placental tissues of human embryos with mosaic karyotype was studied using the genome-wide Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Array (Illumina, USA). The groups of genes, related to the cell cycle and its regulation and containing differentially methylated CpG-sites in their promoter regions, are determined. The methylation level of oncogenes (ARHGEF1, RGF5), tumor-suppressors (APC2, BRACA2, DCC, GRLF1, RB1, TP73, TSPYL2, VHL) as well as genes, participating in chromosome segregation regulation (CNTROB, GMNN, PROCR, TACC1), was changed most frequently.
