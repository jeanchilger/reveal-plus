Trisomy 21 presented as a transient unilateral pleural effusion at 18 weeks' gestation. We describe a rare case in which a unilateral fetal pleural effusion was noted at 18 weeks' gestation with subsequent spontaneous resolution occurring 1 week later. Amniocentesis revealed a trisomy 21 karyotype. Chromosomal analysis may be indicated in cases in which accumulation of fluid in fetal serous cavities has spontaneously resolved.
