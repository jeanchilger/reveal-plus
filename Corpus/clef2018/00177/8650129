Prenatal detection of two different monosomic cell lines by chorionic villus sampling. We present a prenatal case of mosaicism with at least two monosomy cell lines: one with monosomy 21 (45,XY,-21) and one missing the Y (45,X) and a possible third 46,XY in chorionic villus cell culture. Cytogenetic studies were initiated following the ultrasound detection at 11 weeks of a large cystic hygroma and in utero growth retardation. Spontaneous fetal demise occurred at 12 weeks and the pregnancy was terminated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of two different monosomic cell lines found in chorionic villus cells.
