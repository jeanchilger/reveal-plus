Maternal serum prostate-specific antigen and Down syndrome in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. International Prenatal Screening Research Group. It has been suggested that high levels of maternal serum prostate-specific (PSA) may be associated with fetal Down syndrome. We retrieved stored blood samples from 102 singleton Down syndrome pregnancies at 8-14 weeks' gestation and 99 at 15-22 weeks' gestation, together with samples from five unaffected singleton control pregnancies matched for gestational age. PSA was measured using an ultrasensitive assay. Contrary to earlier reports, PSA levels were similar in affected and unaffected pregnancies in both the first and second trimester of pregnancy 1.1 and 0.9 multiple of the normal median, respectively, in affected pregnancies. There was no indication that PSA would be a useful screening marker.
