First-trimester biochemical markers for Down syndrome. The value of maternal serum pregnancy-associated protein A (PAPP-A), free and total beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (fbetahCG, betahCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in screening for Down syndrome (DS) in early pregnancy has been assessed. To evaluate the different biochemical markers, 32 DS pregnancies and 267 controls were used for AFP, betahCG and PAPP-A. A subgroup of those (17 DS and 136 controls) were used to evaluate fbetahCG. All analytes were determined in fresh serum samples. Our results give support to the feasibility of maternal serum levels of PAPP-A as the best biochemical marker for DS in the first trimester, and either betahCG or fbetahCG as the second marker. No differences were found between betahCG and fbetahCG distribution levels as expressed as MoMs in normal and DS pregnancies in this study.
