Prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome: mothers' reflections on supports needed from diagnosis to birth. A qualitative study involving 10 mothers who received a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome and chose to continue their pregnancy was presented. The time frame considered was diagnosis to delivery. We looked at how the diagnosis was presented, the decision to continue the pregnancy, and the mothers' experience with professionals from diagnosis to delivery. Mothers' suggestions to others facing the same challenges and to their health care providers were discussed as were the types of support given these mothers and what was or would have been most helpful to them. The importance of professionals reviewing their procedures and protocols for working with families facing similar circumstances was stressed.
