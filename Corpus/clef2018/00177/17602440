Fetal pleural effusion. Fetal pleural effusion, a nonspecific accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, is an uncommon anomaly which can be associated with aneuploidy and a range of other structural malformations or genetic syndromes. Spontaneous resolution is not rare and confers a good prognosis. Perinatal outcome is better for those fetuses without hydrops than those presenting with hydrops. A detailed review of the literature indicates that, for fetuses with persistent effusions, in utero intervention (repeated thoracocentesis, intrauterine shunting and pleurodesis) may improve the chances of survival.
