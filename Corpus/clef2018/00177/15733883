Prognostic significance of DNA quantification by flow cytometry in ovarian tumors. The objective of our study is to evaluate prognostic significance of DNA quantification by flow cytometry in ovarian tumor.A prospective analysis was performed on 56 ovarian tumor patients treated in the Yonsei Medical Center from Feb. 2000 to Jan. 2003.Regarding the association between tumor grade and the DNA quantitative analysis, as tumor grade increased, the quantity of aneuploid cells and S-phase fraction (SPF) increased. In addition, SPF was increased significantly in the advanced staged patients (P=0.04) and SPF was significantly increased in aneuploid tumors (P=0.03). The overall survival rate was poor for patients with aneuploid tumors and for patients with tumors showing over SPF (10%).Our data demonstrated that the prognosis was poor for patients with aneuploid cancers or increased SPF. Therefore, DNA quantification by flow cytometry may provide important information for predicting the prognosis of the disease.
