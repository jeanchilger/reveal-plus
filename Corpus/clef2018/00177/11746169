Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), a collaborative activity of clinical genetic departments and IVF centres. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) requires the combined efforts of geneticists and workers in the field of reproductive medicine. This was studied on the basis of a questionnaire, sent to 35 members of the PGD Consortium of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE). A reply was obtained from 20 centres. They represent the majority of activities in the field of PGD in the world. It is obvious that many of the activities (in vitro fertilisation, embryo culture and biopsy) take place in IVF units while others (counselling and diagnosis) are the responsibility of genetic diagnostic centres. The distances between both units vary considerably. In all but one centre sex determination is offered. Aneuploidy screening is offered in 13 out of 20 centres. PGD of translocations and other structural chromosome abnormalities is offered in all but one centre. The number of monogenic diseases offered varies considerably. In comparison to prenatal diagnosis PGD is more expensive. The majority of these costs are due to the IVF or ICSI procedure. The charges for PGD vary between about 600 euro and 4000 euro. In 16 out of 20 centres the parents to be must sign an informed consent form.
