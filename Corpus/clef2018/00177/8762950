Turner syndrome: spontaneous growth of stature, weight increase and accelerated bone maturation. Since growth hormone is effective in increasing the height of girls with Turner's syndrome, it is important to dispose of growth and bone maturation curves in a large number of untreated patients.Data on growth and bone maturation were collected from 160 patients with Turner's syndrome (50 have reached final height), born 1965-1991, untreated with growth hormone or anabolic steroids. X monosomy was found in half of the patients, mosaicism or X abnormality was present in the other half. Spontaneous puberty occurred in 25% (n = 25) of patients older than 13 years, 38 patients received estrogen after 13 years. Final heights were compared to predicted height according to Lyon's method.Forty-five percent of patients were small for date. Height velocity decreased from 2 years of age and decreased faster during adolescence, when gonadal dysgenesis occurred. Bone maturation velocity decreased also during adolescence. Excessive weight appeared after the age of 5 years. Patients with partial deletion of the long arm of X (n = 6) were taller than the other girls (n = 44) (mean +/- DS) 152.5 +/- 3.1 cm, range 150-158 cm versus 142.5 +/- 4.9 cm, 130-150 cm (P < 0.0001). Final height was not modified by spontaneous puberty. Final height was correlated with birth weight (r = 0.7), maternal height (r = 0.5) and mid parental height (r = 0.5). Finally, the Lyon's method for predicted final height seemed to be suitable for this population, (r = 0.8, P < 0.001).Appropriate growth curve is an essential clinical tool in evaluating treatment aimed at increasing final stature in patients with Turner's syndrome.
