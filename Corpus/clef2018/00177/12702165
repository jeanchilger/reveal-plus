Spectrum of clinical variability in familial deletion 22q11.2: from full manifestation to extremely mild clinical anomalies. The 22q11.2 deletion (del22q11.2) syndrome is a genetic condition with wide interfamilial and intrafamilial variability in clinical expression. The aim of the present study was to review the prevalence of parental transmission in our series of patients with del22q11.2, and to analyse clinical findings of the affected parents. Parental transmission of del22q11.2 in our series was 17.2% (15/87), with a preferential maternal transmission (10/15). One or more major features of del22q11.2 were found in all deleted parents, but one of the mothers showed extremely mild clinical anomalies. The present data demonstrate that it should be current policy to test both parents of patients with del22q11.2, irrespective of the parental phenotype, in view of the fact that extremely mild clinical features can be detected in parents of deleted patients. This would provide accurate genetic counselling to del22q11.2 families, as relatively asymptomatic parents must be advised of the 50% risk of transmitting the deletion in a subsequent pregnancy. Various genetic and non-genetic factors, including modifier genes at separate loci, mosaicism, unstable mutations, allelic variations at the haploid locus, chance and environmental interaction, can be hypothesized to be involved in variable clinical expression, even in the same family.
