Supernumerary microchromosomes identified as inverted duplications of chromosome 15: a report of three cases. Supernumerary bisatellited microchromosomes detected in three unrelated patients were identified as inverted duplications of chromosome 15. Each of these chromosomes contained a small euchromatic interstitial band presumably derived from the proximal portion of region 15q1. The clinical significance of this material was difficult to assess. Two of our cases were ascertained as the result of routine amniotic fluid studies. One of the affected fetuses had an unusual form of mosaicism 46,XY/48,XY, + inv dup(15), + inv dup(15), but no apparent developmental abnormalities. The inv dup (15) of the second fetus was familial in origin no phenotypic abnormalities or evidence of mosaicism were detected in the carrier parent. The third inv dup(15) was found in a 20.5-month-old boy referred for developmental retardation. The clinical findings in this case were similar to those seen in patients with large inv dup(15)'s and did not suggest Prader-Willi syndrome.
