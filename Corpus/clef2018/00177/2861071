Adrenergic sensitivity of cultured murine trisomy 16 cells. Murine trisomy 16 (Ts16) has been proposed as a model to study Down's syndrome (DS), because mouse chromosome 16 carries several genes homologous to loci on the human chromosome 21. A characteristic of DS is an increased sensitivity to adrenergic ligands. We have tested the sensitivity of murine Ts16 fibroblasts and embryonic cells to epinephrine and isoproterenol. A 2-4-fold reduction in the accumulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) was observed in response to these beta 1-adrenergic ligands. Since these cells also accumulated a 2-4-fold reduced amount of cAMP in response to prostaglandin E1, the data suggest that a change in the adenylcyclase of these cells exists which is not seen in cells derived from DS individuals. Therefore, murine Ts16 cells do not appear to constitute an appropriate model to study the altered adrenergic function of DS.
