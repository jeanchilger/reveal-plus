Chorionic villus culture for first trimester diagnosis of chromosome defects: evaluation by two London centres. The maceration technique for the culture of chorionic villi has been applied by St Mary's Hospital and King's College Hospital, to a total of 225 villus aspirates of which 100 were from diagnostic cases. Two hundred and eighteen (96.8 per cent) of these were successfully karyotyped, and chromosome abnormalities were detected in 15 cases. Of the cases with a normal karyotype, 113 were male and 90 were female. Sixty-nine (77 per cent) of the female cultures were demonstrated to be fetal and a further two of these may be verified at delivery. The use of Chang medium was found to accelerate cell growth thereby reducing the interval between sampling and reporting to less than 2 weeks. An unlimited quantity of metaphase spreads was obtained suitable for the application of routine banding techniques, and comparable to those obtained from amniotic fluid culture. Experience with diagnostic cases reinforced our view that culture should always back up direct analysis and this is discussed with particular reference to the occurrence of mosaicism in the trophoblast.
