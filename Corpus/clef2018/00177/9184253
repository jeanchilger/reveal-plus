Prenatal detection of double aneuploidy trisomy 10/monosomy X in a liveborn twin with exclusively monosomy X in blood. Both double aneuploidy and trisomy 10 are rare chromosome findings. All five published cases of trisomy 10 in liveborns were found to be mosaic with an euploid cell line. In a liveborn female twin, double aneuploidy mosaicism 47,XX, + 10/45,X was detected prenatally by amniocentesis performed because of severe intrauterine growth retardation and malformations. Chromosome analysis from neonatal lymphocyte cultures revealed exclusively the 45,X cell line. Double aneuploidy mosaicism trisomy 10/monosomy X was confirmed from skin fibroblasts. The child died at the age of 7 weeks. This is the first reported case of double aneuploidy involving trisomy 10, and the first case of trisomy 10 without a normal cell line in a liveborn. Prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 10 in a liveborn has not been published so far. The case illustrates that in specific cases amniotic fluid cells may reflect the karyotype of the fetus better than blood.
