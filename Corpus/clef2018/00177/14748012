A trisomic transmission disequilibrium test. Certain congenital disorders that are rare in the general population are quite common in individuals with trisomic conditions. For example, complete atrioventricular septal defect occurs in about 20% of individuals with Down syndrome, an approximately 500-fold increase in risk as compared to individuals without Down syndrome. Genetic variation on the chromosome involved in the trisomy may affect susceptibility to these trisomy-specific disorders. That is, increased dosage of a variant may be directly involved in increasing the risk of a disorder, or it may be indirectly involved by causing up- or downregulation of other genes. As in standard disomic gene-mapping, one can search for genes using linkage or association methods. Within association methods, one can consider case-control methods or family-based control methods such as the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT). Most gene-mapping methods need to be substantially redesigned for use with trisomic data. In this paper, we present a "trisomic TDT", a statistical method of testing for nonrandom transmission of alleles from parents to trisomic children. We demonstrate the method on a dataset of parent-child trios in which the child has Down syndrome.
