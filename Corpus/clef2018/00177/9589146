Anomalous fetal venous return associated with major chromosomopathies in the late first trimester of pregnancy. We report three cases of increased nuchal translucency at 12-13 weeks of gestation in three fetuses with trisomies 13, 18 and 21. All three fetuses were associated with anomalous venous return evaluated by Doppler ultrasonography. Complete pathological examination was performed following termination in each case. We suggest that alterations in the venous compartment can be an early sign of poor outcome and should prompt a detailed search for cardiac defects early in gestation.
