Application of the fluorescent in situ hybridization on the prenatal diagnosis of the fetal aneuploidy in the uncultured amniocytes. To study the method and value of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on the rapid prenatal diagnosis of the fetal aneuploidy in the uncultured amniocytes.Amniocentesis was performed in 20 pregnant women of 16-36 gestational weeks with indications of prenatal diagnosis. We performed FISH, respectively, with the biotin labelled chromosome X and 18 centromeric probes and the digoxin labelled chromosome Y centromeric and 21q11 and 13q14-q21 specific probes on the uncultured amniocytes. The slides were observed under the fluorescent microscope and the images were captured by the Applied Imaging System.Normal chromosome number was observed in 19 cases: 10 cases of 46, XX and 9 cases of 46, XY. Aneuploidy was found in 1 case which was 46, XY/47, XXY and proved by G-banding chromosomal on cord blood.Fetal aneuploidy could be diagnosed within 24 hours after the amniocentesis by FISH. FISH is a rapid, accurate and reliable method to detect fetal aneuphoidy in uncultured amniocytes.
