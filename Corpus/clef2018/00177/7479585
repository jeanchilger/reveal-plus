Crown-rump length in aneuploid fetuses: implications for first-trimester biochemical screening for aneuploidies. This study examined the effect of estimation of gestational age from the menstrual history compared with that from crown-rump length (CRL) measurement on the detection rate of screening for aneuploidies in the first trimester. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) was assayed in blood collected prior to chorionic villus sampling in 356 women with unaffected pregnancies and 28 women with an aneuploid pregnancy. There were 14 Down's syndrome (DS) pregnancies. All pregnancies were dated from menstrual history and CRL measurement. The average CRL gestation in the aneuploid population was 2.5 days less than that derived from the LMP (95 per cent confidence interval (CI) for LMP-CRL gestation: using the algorithm based on unaffected pregnancies 0-3.5 days using the matched case-control approach 1-4.5 days). The average CRL gestation in the DS population was 2 days less but this did not reach statistical significance (95 per cent CI for LMP-CRL gestation: using the algorithm -1 to 4.5 days
