Rapid karyotyping of spontaneous abortions with trophoblastic villi. 24-hour short term culture of trophoblastic villi provided rapid and accurate karyotypes in spontaneous first trimester abortions. Good quality metaphases were obtained in 60.0% of villous cultures if these were set up within 8 hours of uterine evacuation, in contrast to the 10.3% success rate with intervals longer than 8 hours. 21% (4 of 19) of first trimester pregnancy losses were chromosomally abnormal, 3 of which were examples of autosomal trisomy in 2 cases, the mothers were more than 37 years of age. The results of successful karyotyping reported here compare well with previous reports of long term culture of minced fetal material. Further, the risks of infected cultures, maternal contamination and pseudomosaicism are minimal with the short-term culture technique described here. Chorionic villi isolated from spontaneously aborted material are a simple and practicable source of fetal material for rapid and accurate cytogenic diagnosis in early spontaneous abortions.
