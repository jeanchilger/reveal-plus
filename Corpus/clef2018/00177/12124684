Prenatally detected trisomy 7 mosaicism in a dysmorphic child. Trisomy 7 mosaicism was detected prenatally in cultured amniocytes but not in fetal lymphocytes. The child that was born had pigmentary changes of the skin and facial asymmetry suggestive of a chromosomal mosaicism. Skin fibroblasts were studied and trisomy 7 mosaicism was confirmed. At 3 years of age the boy had developed mentally within normal limits. However, dysmorphic findings include sparse hair, short left palpebral fissure, ptosis of the left eyelid, strabismus, enamel dysplasia, low-set and posteriorly rotated ears and undescended testes. These findings share some common features with previously reported cases of trisomy 7 mosaicism.
