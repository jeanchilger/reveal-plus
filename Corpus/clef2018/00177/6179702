Amniocentesis for antenatal diagnosis. Midtrimester amniocentesis is currently the most widely employed technique to monitor fetuses for certain genetic risks. The procedure is generally regarded as safe. However, the small but significant risks must be understood by couples considering this procedure. The most common indications for genetic amniocentesis include advanced parental age, previous child with a chromosomal abnormality, a parental translocation or other chromosomal abnormality, certain Mendelian disorders, and a previous child with a neural tube defect.
