Prenatal detection of an unstable ring 21 chromosome. An unstable ring chromosome 21 detected through prenatal studies was associated at birth with an apparently normal male phenotype. At 14 months of age, examination indicated only minor developmental delay. The majority of cells examined from amniocyte, fibroblast, and lymphocyte cultures contained an asymmetrical dicentric ring 21 chromosome which was larger than a normal chromosome 21. This ring is presumed to be a duplication for most of chromosome 21 and a deletion of part of the terminal regions. The karyotype is described as mos45,XY,-21/46,XY,r(21)(p13q22.3). The child is monosomic for part of the sub-band 21q22.3 in every cell and trisomic for the remainder of the chromosome in most of his cells. The terminal deletion does not appear to have been severely detrimental to the phenotype and the effective trisomy present in many cells studied was insufficient to cause the Down syndrome.
