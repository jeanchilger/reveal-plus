Cytogenetic findings in over 2000 amniocenteses. Between 1971 and 1981, 58 (2.8%) of 2037 amniocenteses performed in Vancouver revealed chromosome abnormalities, 25 of which were trisomy 21. Of the 58 referrals that yielded abnormalities, 37 (63.8%) were for a maternal age of 38 years or more. The rates of detection of such abnormalities for single-year intervals of maternal age beyond 35 years were comparable to those calculated from pooled data obtained in multicentre studies in the United States, Canada and Europe.
