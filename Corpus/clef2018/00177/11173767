Ultrasonographically normal fetal heart. The fetal heart must be systematically checked in routine ultrasonographic examination to detect any cardiac abnormality. The quality of the examination requires good knowledge of development and anatomy of the fetal heart. A complete examination will study inflow and outflow tracts: inflow tract on the four-chamber view, outflow tract by a static and dynamic study of the great arteries (on section in fetal axial and saggital planes). All cardiac abnormalities indicate the need for a fetal karyotype after a complete morphologic study. Atrioventricular septal defect (ASD) for Down's syndrome and malaligment septal defect of cono-truncal pathology are both excellent signs of chromosome abnormality. Special attention must be paid to cardiac abnormalities without a prenatal diagnosis due to the prognosis risk: complete transposition and total abomalous venous connection. These cardiac abnormalities, as well as complex isolated congenital heart disease, require a cardiopediatric evaluation to determine prognosis and management strategy.
