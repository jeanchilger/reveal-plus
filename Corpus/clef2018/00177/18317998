First-trimester maternal serum progesterone in aneuploid pregnancies. First-trimester maternal serum screening for Down syndrome (DS) can be improved by the use of additional serum markers. We examined whether progesterone (P), synthesized by placenta, might be a first-trimester maternal serum marker for fetal DS.P was quantified in first-trimester maternal serum from 42 DS, six trisomy 18 and two trisomy 13 pregnancies and 115 controls. Log-regression of P versus gestational age in days was used to convert P concentrations into multiples of the median (MoM).The P concentrations in controls increased with gestational age (p = 9.5 x 10(-7)). The log10MoM P distribution in DS pregnancies was not significantly different from that in controls. However, from day 58-67, the log10MoM P was elevated in DS pregnancies (n = 10) with a mean (SD) of 0.1040 (0.0956), compared to a mean (SD) of - 0.0109 (0.1661) in controls (n = 24) (p = 0.05). Five out of six trisomy 18 and both trisomy 13 pregnancies had a P MoM < 1.P is not a useful marker for DS in first trimester, except perhaps in a narrow gestational age window from day 58 to 67. P is a trisomy 18/13 marker.
