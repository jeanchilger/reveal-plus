Chromosomally abnormal early ongoing pregnancies: correlation of ultrasound and placental histological findings. The pathophysiology of placental microscopic changes in chromosomally abnormal pregnancies remains poorly understood. We have reviewed the relationship between ultrasound findings and villous histological features in a group of 25 ongoing pregnancies presenting with fetal aneuploidy at 11 to 15 weeks of gestation. The chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed by chorion villous sampling, and the data were compared with those of a group of 25 chromosomally normal pregnancies undergoing surgical termination and matched for gestational age. The aneuploid group included 10 pregnancies with trisomy 21, nine with trisomy 18, three with triploidy, two with monosomy X, and one with trisomy 13. The overall degree of agreement between the two investigators for the histological diagnosis was good (kappa, 0.64), and the sensitivity of histology ranged between 72.0% and 80.0%. Fetal and placental edema was observed on scan in 10 and 7 cases, respectively, of the aneuploid group and was systematically associated with trophoblastic hypoplasia, stromal edema, or cavitation, reduced vascularization, and ramification of the main villous trunks. Fetoplacental hydrops was not observed in the euploid group. These findings indicate that histological changes observed in the placenta of fetuses from ongoing pregnancies presenting with aneuploidy can be linked with early fetal hydrops. The villous features in these cases are probably secondary to a reduction in the villous circulation due to a cardiovascular defect and leading to generalized stromal edema. The reduced villous branching and trophoblastic hypoplasia could be secondary to the enlargement of all villous types or to a basic defect in placental development.
