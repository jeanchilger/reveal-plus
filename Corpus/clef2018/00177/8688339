Fertility, reproductive outcomes, and health of offspring, of patients treated for Hodgkin's disease: an investigation including chromosome examinations. Reproductive outcomes and health of offspring were investigated in 340 patients with Hodgkin's disease first treated at Mount Vernon Hospital, Middlesex, England, at ages under 40 (females) or 45 (males) during 1970-91. Information on offspring was obtained from case-notes and postal questionnaires to the patients. Eleven men and 16 women who had conceived any children after treatment were then interviewed. There was no excess of stillbirths, low birthweight or cogenital malformations, and no cancers have occurred in the 49 offspring after treatment. There was a significant excess of twins, compared with national expectations, in offspring of female patients (RR = 8.52, P = 0.025). Aggregation of series from the literature also showed an excess of twins. Chromosomes from cultures of peripheral lymphocytes from 45 children born to 25 patients (11 men and 14 women) after treatment were examined for numerical abnormalities and for structural abnormalities at the 550 or greater band level of resolution. All were normal except in one child with Down's syndrome (47, XY, +21), for whom we found the origin of the trisomy was from the parent without Hodgkin's disease. The chromosome constitution was also abnormal in one miscarriage (69, XXY originating from the parent without Hodgkin's disease) and one termination (45, X
