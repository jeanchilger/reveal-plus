Prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis in 82 pregnancies after in vitro fertilization. We report on the outcome of 82 amniocenteses (AC) carried out during pregnancies after in vitro fertilization (IVF) from 1-1-1985 to 31-12-1989. The main indication for amniocentesis was a maternal age of greater than or equal to 35 years. In 48 cases, we found an anterior placenta and assumed that this was related to the position in which the uterine embryo transfer was performed. In six pregnancies, we found an abnormal karyotype, including two cases of trisomy 21 the two couples decided for abortion. Four aberrations in the fetal karyotypes were also present in either the mother or the father, the resulting children are healthy. The further course of pregnancies after IVF and AC was characterized by a higher incidence of toxemia, uterine bleeding before the 28th week of gestation, abruptio placentae, and premature deliveries, when compared to the course of pregnancies after spontaneous conception. We believe that these occurrences were not caused by AC, as the incidence was higher in all our pregnancies after IVF (without AC) and has also been reported in pregnancies after ovarian hyperstimulation without IVF. Therefore, we see no reason to renounce AC after IVF. However, the special risks inherent in pregnancies after IVF must always be discussed with the couple.
