Maternal serum activin A and follistatin levels in pregnancies with Down syndrome. Inhibin A is now an established second-trimester maternal serum marker of Down syndrome. Since activin A has a common beta-subunit to inhibin A we evaluated this substance and its binding protein, follistatin, as potential markers. We studied 30 affected and 199 unaffected pregnancies at 13-16 weeks' gestation. There was a statistically significant increase in activin A level among the cases with 8 (27 per cent) exceeding the 90th centile in the controls, and 6 (20 per cent) above the 95th centile. However, the extent of overlap was too great to be of value in screening. There was a small decrease in follistatin levels among cases but it did not reach statistical significance.
