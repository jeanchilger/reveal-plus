A characteristic cluster of fetal sonographic markers that are predictive of fetal Turner syndrome in early pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to describe a characteristic cluster of sonographic features of fetuses with Turner syndrome in early pregnancy.A targeted transvaginal ultrasound examination of all fetal organs was performed for 40123 consecutive pregnant women at 14 to 16 weeks of gestation. Both low- and high-risk pregnancies were included. Fetal karyotyping was performed in 9348 cases. The main indications were major fetal anomalies, advanced maternal age, abnormal biochemical markers, maternal anxiety, and request.Turner syndrome was detected in 13 fetuses (0.03%, 1/3086 early pregnancies). Huge septated cystic hygroma, severe subcutaneous edema, and hydrops were observed in all cases. A short femur was detected in 12 of 13 fetuses. A narrow aortic arch was visualized in all 8 fetuses who were scanned after 1995, when scanning of the aortic arch became mandatory in our institution. Four other fetuses had three or four of the five markers, 2 of the fetuses had trisomy 21, 1 fetus was normal, and one case of missed abortion occurred without a karyotype.A reliable diagnosis of Turner syndrome by sonographic means is possible in early pregnancy.
