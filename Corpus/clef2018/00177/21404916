Homocysteine in pregnancy. The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence for and against fasting plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) as a biomarker/risk factor of impaired reproductive function before and during pregnancy. Apart from nutritional and lifestyle factors, tHcy is also influenced by physiological factors specific to pregnancy such as hemodilution, increased glomerular filtration rate, and endocrinological changes. These lead to a considerable reduction under normal circumstances in tHcy by midpregnancy. Stimulating excess endogenous homocysteine production before and during pregnancy in animal experiments and adding exogenous homocysteine to cell cultures result in the impairment of reproductive and developmental processes from preconception throughout pregnancy and during subsequent development of the offspring. Different studies have confirmed that elevated tHcy is a risk factor for subfertility, congenital developmental defects, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation. There is conflicting evidence that elevated tHcy is a risk factor for miscarriage, gestational diabetes, premature rupture of the membranes, placental abruption, and offspring with Down syndrome. Prospective, sufficiently powered, studies from preconception/early pregnancy are required to determine whether tHcy is a risk factor for these pregnancy complications.
