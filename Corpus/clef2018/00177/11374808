Nuclear DNA content and proliferative potential of human carcinoma in situ cells in testes of intersex children. Gonocytes, fetal germ cells, when persisted beyond infantile period of life are considered as preinvasive testicular germ cell cancer (carcinoma in situ--CIS). The aim of the study was to investigate nuclear DNA content and proliferative potential of CIS cells together with the expression of placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), a marker of CIS and germ cell cancer. In dysgenetic testes of 4 intersex children proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and PLAP were examined immunohistochemically. DNA content was assessed by densitometry of nucleus in Feulgen stained histologic sections. High incidence of aneuploidy (95.1-97.6% of CIS cells with 2.6-6.8c) was found with the predominant DNA pattern of tri- and tetraploidy in children aged 1 to 3 years. The incidence of triploidy (65-78.1% of cells) was similar to the incidence of the expression of PCNA (53.4-62%), what indicates that part of hyperploid germ cells might represent phase S of cell cycle, but the rest of hyperploid cells might represent neoplastic transformation. In turn, germ cells of 8-months-old patient were predominantly diploid with low incidence of PCNA positive cells which indicate that proliferation/neoplastic transformation of abnormal germ cells is significant mostly after 1 year of age in intersex children. The frequency of PLAP expression in CIS cells (3.1-27% of cells) was weakly related to the frequency of aneuploidy what limits the usefulness of PLAP reaction for the detection of CIS cells.
