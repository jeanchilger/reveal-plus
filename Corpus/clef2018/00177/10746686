Transient myeloproliferative disease of the newborn: case report with placental, cytogenetic, and flow cytometric findings. Transient myeloproliferative disease (TMD) of the newborn is a rare hematologic abnormality associated with trisomy 21. It is frequently difficult to distinguish the disorder from true congenital leukemia (TCL). Unlike leukemia, which has a clinically aggressive course, TMD generally resolves within weeks to months. We present a case of TMD of the newborn diagnosed on the basis of peripheral blood studies and describe the pertinent pathological findings within the placenta. Flow cytometric analysis of the blasts in the peripheral blood showed phenotypic heterogeneity with features consistent with megakaryocytic differentiation. Cytogenetic studies showed trisomy 21 within the blastic cells. The placenta showed villous dysmaturity with associated chorangiosis and prominent intravascular aggregates of primitive-appearing cells with focal, early vascular wall invasion. The neonate recovered fully and shows no evidence of disease at 2 years of age.
