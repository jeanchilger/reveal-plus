Pregnancy after cryopreservation of donor oocytes and preimplantation genetic diagnosis of embryos in a patient with ovarian failure. To describe the successful use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to assess the prevalence of meiotic errors after oocyte cryopreservation in an oocyte donation cycle.Case report.Private IVF center.A 42.6-year-old patient with ovarian failure.A donor oocyte IVF cycle with cryopreservation of oocytes followed by thaw, fertilization of oocytes, preimplantation genetic diagnosis for selective aneuploidy, and ET.Preimplantation genetic analysis of chromosomes 13,16,18, 21,22, X, and Y with fluorescence in-situ hybridization.The recipient's initial serum beta-hCG level was 196 mIU/mL 15 days after oocyte retrieval. An initial ultrasound at the sixth week of gestation revealed two gestational sacs. A second ultrasound 1 week later showed a monochorionic twin in sac A and a singleton pregnancy in sac B. Fetal cardiac activity was visualized for all gestations.This case illustrates the feasibility of cryopreservation of donor oocytes combined with preimplantation genetic diagnosis for clinical use in those settings where there may be an increased risk of spindle-related abnormalities.
