Down syndrome biochemical markers and screening for preeclampsia at first and second trimester: correlation with the week of onset and the severity. To estimate the combined screening performance of first and early second trimester prenatal serum markers for Down syndrome, in screening for the development of preeclampsia, and analyze the correlation among marker levels, week of onset, and severity of the disease.A retrospective cohort study was carried out on 32 women with preeclampsia and 3044 controls. Serum samples from these pregnancies were assayed for pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), and inhibin-A. A likelihood ratio and the odds of being affected given a positive result (OAPR) of various combinations of markers were calculated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was performed.In the pregnancies that subsequently developed preeclampsia, first trimester PAPP-A concentration was significantly lower and concentrations of early second trimester inhibin-A and hCG significantly elevated. Levels of early second trimester uE3 and AFP were not significantly altered. We also found that inhibin-A correlates with both onset of the disease and the severity.Down syndrome biochemical markers levels are altered in those patients who subsequently developed preeclampsia and may be a useful screening test for preeclampsia. Inhibin-A is the most predictive marker and correlates with the severity of subsequent preeclampsia and inversely with the week of occurrence of preeclampsia.
