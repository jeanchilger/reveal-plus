Basal FSH, estradiol and inhibin B concentrations in women with a previous Down's syndrome affected pregnancy. Two recent studies reported elevated basal FSH concentrations in women with a history of aneuploid conceptions. However, it is not known whether these elevated basal FSH concentrations reflect depletion of the primordial follicle pool, or were caused by an increased secretory drive for FSH.Inhibin B and estradiol concentrations were measured as indicators for depletion of the primordial follicle pool in women with a history of a Down's syndrome pregnancy and in controls.In the women with a history of a Down's syndrome pregnancy, there was a significant inverse correlation between basal FSH and inhibin B concentrations (P < 0.0001, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.56). In the control group, this correlation did not reach statistical significance.Our data indicate that the elevated basal FSH concentrations observed in women with a history of a Down's syndrome pregnancy are likely to reflect early depletion of the primordial follicle pool. Therefore, further research into the ovarian ageing process could provide more insight in the origination of chromosomal abnormalities during pregnancy.
