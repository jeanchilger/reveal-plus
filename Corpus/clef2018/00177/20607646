First-trimester aneuploidy risk assessment: the impact of comprehensive counseling and same-day results on patient satisfaction, anxiety, and knowledge. We evaluated the added benefit of a comprehensive counseling protocol for first-trimester aneuploidy risk assessment. We performed a prospective cohort study surveying patients referred for first-trimester aneuploidy risk assessment. We compared responses between women who underwent serum testing done in advance of their ultrasound such that their final risk assessment was given to them the same day as their ultrasound (comprehensive) versus women who underwent serum testing the same day as their ultrasound and who therefore received their final risk assessment later (standard). Response rate was 94.8%. The comprehensive group was significantly more likely to receive counseling in accordance with recommended American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines, had significantly greater reduction in anxiety and increased satisfaction, and was more likely to report an increased understanding of their results. The comprehensive group scored significantly higher on test-style questions about aneuploidy risk assessment. Comprehensive aneuploidy risk assessment counseling including same-day results is associated with increased patient understanding and satisfaction, decreased anxiety, and increased adherence to ACOG guidelines.
