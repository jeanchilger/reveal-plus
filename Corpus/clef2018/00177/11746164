Descriptive information about Down syndrome: a content analysis of serum screening leaflets. It is recommended practice that prior to prenatal screening, women receive information about the condition(s) being tested for. The present study critically evaluated information about Down syndrome as contained in 80 leaflets provided to pregnant women in the UK prior to serum screening. First, a content analysis by information type was conducted to give an overall picture of the material provided. Second, the image of the condition as conveyed by the content was analysed and compared with a similar study of cystic fibrosis (CF) screening leaflets. The majority of information (89%) was of a medico-clinical nature, with 11% addressing other issues associated with Down syndrome. The median number of sentences describing the condition was one, with 33% of the leaflets containing no descriptive information. Overall, a negative image of Down syndrome was conveyed by the leaflets, which contrasted with a more neutral image of CF in the comparison study. In order to facilitate informed choices, more attention should be paid to providing women with information about Down syndrome prior to serum screening. Such information needs to be more balanced in its construction, with thought given to the needs of the reader, and to the tone and the content of the message conveyed.
