Deranged hypothetical proteins Rik protein, Nit protein 2 and mitochondrial inner membrane protein, Mitofilin, in fetal Down syndrome brain. Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic disorder with mental retardation and a host of deranged proteins has already been described. Protein hunting leads to rapid accumulation of aberrant proteins and proteomics methods not only allow unambiguous identification of proteins, they are also a powerful tools to identify new or predicted proteins. We applied two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with in-gel digestion of proteins and subsequent MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometrical identification and quantification of spots using specific software on cortical brain samples from 7 controls and 7 samples from fetal DS at the early second trimester. Nine hypothetical proteins were identified: three of them (4833418L03Rik protein Q9D614, mitochondrial inner membrane protein Q16891 and Nit protein 2 Q8WUF0) were significantly and about doublefold reduced in fetal DS brain. Hypothetical proteins CGI 99, FLJ10463, 70 kDa WD-repeat tumor rejection antigen homolog, KSRP, Hypothetical protein 49.6 kDa and Elongin A were comparable between groups. Domain analysis of deranged structures revealed a t_SNARE domain for the Rik protein, indicating involvement of this protein in the exocytotic-synaptic machinery impaired in DS, a CN hydrolase domain for Nit protein 2, possibly reflecting aberrant nitrilase-related metabolism and handling and an inner mitochondrial protein, extending knowledge on the mitochondrial deficit in in fetal DS early in life.
