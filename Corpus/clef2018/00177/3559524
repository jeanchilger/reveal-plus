Mosaic tetrasomy 12p. Identical nature of the Pallister syndrome, the Teschler-Nicola/Killian syndrome and mosaic tetrasomy 21. In two cases, first interpreted as mosaic tetrasomy 21, the R banding and the gene dosage studies lead us to conclude to a mosaic tetrasomy 12 p. In Pallister mosaic syndrome and in Teschler-Nicola/Killian syndrome, the very similar clinical signs and the identical abnormal chromosome, missing in leucocytes, led us to conclude that Pallister and Teschler-Nicola/Killian syndrome, as well as mosaic tetrasomy 21 are one and the same syndrome tetrasomy 12 p. This tissue limited mosaic is probably more frequent than it is assumed. Prenatal diagnosis can be made since the supernumerary chromosome is found in amniocytes. The distinctive tissue distribution is probably a selective process due to cellular differentiation gene, CD9 (or Alb 6) located to 12 p.
