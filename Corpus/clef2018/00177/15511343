Outcome of laser-assisted polar body biopsy and aneuploidy testing. Polar body biopsy and subsequent fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis allows detection of maternally derived chromosomal aneuploidies in human oocytes during IVF treatment. The development of a diode laser technique for the partial opening of the zona pellucida has stimulated the use of this technique to assist polar body biopsy. Laser-assisted polar body biopsy was performed in 140 IVF cycles from patients of advanced maternal age (> or =35 years). A total of 921 oocytes were treated by a laser for partial zona opening and polar body removal. FISH was performed for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21 and 22 and results were available for 903 oocytes (98%). In all, 443 oocytes (49.1%) were euploid and of these, 293 were fertilized. A total of 214 embryos were transferred in 120 embryo transfer cycles (1.78 per embryo transfer) resulting in 27 clinical pregnancies (22.5% per embryo transfer) with an implantation rate of 15.4%. Subsequently, five women aborted (18.5%) and 24 healthy children were born from the remaining 22 pregnancies, which gives a take home baby rate of 18.3% per transfer cycle. It is concluded that polar body biopsy using a diode laser system is as efficient as standard polar body biopsy using zona drilling.
