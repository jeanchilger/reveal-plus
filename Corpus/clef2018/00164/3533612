Metastatic focal infections due to multiresistant Salmonella typhimurium in children: a 34 month experience in Rwanda. Nineteen out of 139 children with severe systemic disease due to multiresistant Salmonella typhimurium observed during a 34-month period in an in-patient department in Rwanda had focal metastatic infections. More than 80% of the invasive Salmonella infections were acquired in the hospital. Focal metastatic infections occurred after longer hospital stays than bacteremia (29.1 +/- 17.4 days as against 13.5 +/- 9.0 days, p less than 0.01) and were diagnosed more time after the first sign of infection (3.28 +/- 1.41 days as against 1.86 +/- 1.10 days, p less than 0.01). Bacteremia was documented in 13 of the 17 children with focal infection from whom blood cultures were obtained. Seven of 12 had positive stool cultures. The sites of metastatic focal infection were meninges (7 cases), soft tissue (5 cases), joint or bone (4 cases), pleura (2 cases), eye (1 case). The clinical course of meningitis was fulminant and 6/7 patients died before receiving adequate antimicrobial therapy. One child with meningitis and 9 patients with focal infections at other sites were treated with cefotaxime and were cured or improved.
