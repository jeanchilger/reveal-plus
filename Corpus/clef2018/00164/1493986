Randomized prospective study comparing two dosage regimens of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of typhoid fever. Sixty-two patients with blood culture-proven typhoid fever were randomly assigned to receive either 500 or 750 mg of ciprofloxacin orally, twice daily for 7 days or for two days following defervescence, whichever was greater. Thirty-four and 28 patients received 500 mg and 750 mg respectively. Strains of Salmonella typhi resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole were isolated from the blood of 27 patients (43.5%). No resistance to ciprofloxacin was encountered. Both regimens were equally effective fever subsided in mean times of 4.9 +/- 1.7 days in the 500 mg group and 5.2 +/- 2.2 days in the 750 mg group (P = 0.54). All patients were cured, although one patient in the 750 mg group experienced a presumed relapse two months following completion of therapy. Ciprofloxacin administered for 7-10 days was adequate treatment for 57 of the 62 patients (92%)
