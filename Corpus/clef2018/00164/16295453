Changing face of septicaemia and increasing drug resistance in blood isolates. In a retrospective study conducted between January, 2000 and December 2000, 7157 adults and children were studied. Amongst these, 1071 patients had positive blood cultures. Of these, 575 (53.6%) cases were community acquired septicaemia and 486 (46.4%) cases had developed septicaemia of nosocomial origin. Gram negative aerobes accounted for 708 (66.1%) isolates. Amongst them, Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated (23%), followed by Escherichia coli (14%). Acinetobacter spp. emerged as the next common pathogen (9%), followed by Salmonella typhi (5.4%). Staphylococcus aureus (9%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (9%) were the most common gram positive isolates followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). Antibiotic susceptibility of all these isolates was performed by the modified Stokes' method. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli showed alarmingly high resistance to all groups of antibiotics with 70-80% resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. Minimum resistance was observed against cefotaxime (23%) and ciprofloxacin (12%). Majority of Enterococcus faecalis were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited 26% resistance to penicillin. Thus, the study clearly highlights the rising level of drug resistance amongst the bacterial isolates from blood and hence the need to update and formulate newer drug policies.
