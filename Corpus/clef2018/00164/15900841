A case with fever of unknown origin during treatment for malaria: multi-drug resistant Salmonella typhi infection. Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease caused by Salmonella serotype Typhi, leading to endemic or epidemic outbreaks in tropical/ subtropical countries (especially in India, Southeast Asia, Central and South Africa). In this report, a 27 years old male patient with malaria has been presented. The patient was diagnosed to have malaria while working in Afghanistan, and received malaria treatment since one month. He admitted to our hospital because of still continuing high fever, and other complaints (weight loss, night sweats, weakness, anorexia). His fever was 39.5 degrees C at admission, and blood smears were negative for Plasmodium sp. On the third day of admission, rose spots were detected on the skin of the abdomen and chest, and group agglutination tests gave positive results for S. Typhi O (titer: 1/800), and S. Typhi H (titer: 1/3200). Blood cultures revealed growth of Salmonella enterica serotip Typhi. The isolate was found to be resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclin and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The patient was treated successfully with ciprofloxacin for 14 days.
