Clinical profile and antibiotics response in typhoid fever. The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical profile and drug response in typhoid fever.This is a retrospective analysis of paediatric patients suffering from typhoid fever who were admitted at Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital, Sinamangal during the period of two years and nine months.Total numbers of 100 cases of typhoid were studied. Diagnosis of Typhoid fever was based on clinical features, Widal test and blood culture. The sensitivity pattern of drugs in blood culture was recorded. The mode of presentation, treatment history, laboratory investigations reports, antibiotics administered and response to therapy were recorded.Quinolone is still the highly sensitive drug and most widely used for Salmonella typhi. Because of the indiscriminate use of these drugs, resistant to ciprofloxacin has been quite high and the duration of the defeverscence period has also been prolonged. But Ofloxacin is still showed highly effective and widely used with good response.
