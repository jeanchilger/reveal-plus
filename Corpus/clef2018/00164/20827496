Analysis of characteristics of paratyphoid A in 157 Chinese inpatients between 1998 and 2009. The objectives of this study were to understand the epidemic rules, clinical characteristics, and drug resistance of paratyphoid A by analyzing 157 cases in the Wenzhou area of China during a 12-year period. The subjects included in the present study were patients with paratyphoid A who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College (Wenzhou, ZJ, China) between 1998 and 2009. The disease mainly occurred in persons aged 20 to 50 years. The peak incidence was between 2001 and 2003 (n = 85). Paratyphoid A was more likely to occur in winter and spring in this area. In many cases (33.8%), the condition was complicated by underlying diseases. The length of hospital stay was relatively long, averaging 17.68 days. The white blood cell (WBC) count was 2-8 × 10(9)/L in 88.5% of cases. Eosinophils disappeared in 51.7% of cases. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was not significant and lower than 60 mm/h in 88.5% of cases. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was ≤3-fold greater than the normal value in 84.3% of cases. The Widal test was positive in only 7.7% of our cases. The sensitivity of many antibiotics was over 90%. Paratyphoid A in the Wenzhou area has unique epidemic rules, clinical characteristics, and drug resistance. The results of our retrospective analysis are instructive for the early diagnosis and rational treatment of paratyphoid A.
