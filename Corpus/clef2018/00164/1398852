Multidrug resistant Salmonella typhi in Delhi. In 1990, we isolated 158 strains of Salmonella typhi from blood cultures of patients suffering from typhoid fever. Seventy nine (50%) of these isolates were found to be simultaneously resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole. These strains were also resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline, but sensitive to gentamicin, amikacin and cephalexin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol and trimethoprim for a representative number of these strains were found to be greater than 1024 micrograms/ml and greater than 128 micrograms/ml respectively. Majority of the multidrug resistant (MDR) strains tested against cefotaxime (23/23), ciprofloxacin (38/38) and amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid (23/24) were sensitive to these drugs.
