Antimicrobial resistance among blood culture isolates of Salmonella enterica in New Delhi. Enteric fever is a global public health problem, especially in developing countries. Antimicrobial resistance is a major issue enteric fever management. This study examined current pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility among Salmonella enterica isolates from enteric fever cases at a tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India.Blood cultures from patients with enteric fever during January 2010- July 2012 were processed using the BACTEC automated system. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method and/or Phoenix 100 automated system.Of 344 isolates of Salmonella enterica, 266 (77.3%) were S. Typhi, 77 (22.4%) were S. Paratyphi A, and one (0.3%) was S. Paratyphi B. Resistance to nalidixic acid (NA(R)) (96.7%) was most common, followed by ciprofloxacin (37.9%), and azithromycin (7.3%). Multi-drug resistance was observed only in S. Typhi (3.4%). Among NA(R) strains, 61.8% were sensitive, 11.1% were moderately sensitive, and 23.9% were resistant to ciprofloxacin (0.8%, 57.4%, and 37.9% respectively according to revised CLSI breakpoint criteria for ciprofloxacin). Resistance to third-generation cephalosporin was found in seven (2%) strains of S. enterica.Increasing rates of nalidixic acid, fluoroquinolone and azithromycin resistance among S. enterica, particularly in S. Paratyphi A strains, is of concern, as S. Paratyphi A infection is becoming increasingly common and is not prevented by current vaccinations. Our results favour use of cefexime or possibly chloramphenicol as first choice for uncomplicated enteric fever. MICs for third-generation cephalosporins and susceptibility pattern must be closely monitored in view of its emerging resistance among Salmonella enterica.
