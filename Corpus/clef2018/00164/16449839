Study of clinical profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern in culture positive typhoid fever cases. The present study was designed to analyze the clinical profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern in the cases of culture positive typhoid fever.The study was conducted over a period of 1 year. Total of 46 culture positive cases of Typhoid fever were included in the study. The sensitivity pattern of isolates from blood culture was recorded. The modes of presentation, clinical course, lab investigation reports were also recorded.Out of 46 cases, 33 (71.7%) were males and 13 (28.3%) were females. Average age of presentation was 26.17 years. Fever was present in all patients. Resistance of S .typhi to amoxycillin, chloramphenicol and co-trimoxazole were significantly high. Ciprofloxacin showed resistance in 2 (4.3%) cases. Sensitivity to ceftriaxone was 100% in our study.Typhoid fever is one of the most common health problem in Nepal. Various drugs are being used in the treatment of typhoid fever, in the mean time resistance to many of them are emerging. An appropriate antibiotic has to be initiated only after culture sensitivity in typhoid fever.
