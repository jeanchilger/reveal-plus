Acute exacerbations due to Streptococcus pneumoniae in chronic lower respiratory tract infections during long-term macrolide therapy. In Japan, long-term 14-membered macrolide administration is chosen as a first line therapy against chronic lower respiratory tract infections (CLRTIs) such as diffuse panbronchiolitis, bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis. However, sometimes acute exacerbations occur in these cases, even if therapy is effective. We investigated 18 episodes of CLRTIs exacerbations that were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae during long-term macrolides therapy from 1991 to 1999 to clarify the clinical features and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae. Exacerbations did not occur only in winter season, but also in other seasons. Among 18 episodes of exacerbation, only 7 episodes (39%) revealed infiltration in chest roentogenogram and few episodes revealed marked elevations of inflammation markers in laboratory data. Intermediate resistance or resistance rates of S. pneumoniae isolated from sputum or transtracheal aspiration were 100% to erythromycin, 67% to clindamycin or minocycline, 11% to ampicillin, and 0% to cephazoline or imipenem. Coresistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and minocycline was seen in a half of the episodes. Resistance was not correlated with the duration of macrolides administration. All episodes were mainly treated with beta-lactam agents or fluoroquinolones and cured successfully. These findings suggest that acute exacerbations in CLRTIs caused by S. pneumoniae during long-term macrolides therapy do not reveal severe clinical aspects and can be treated successfully at present, but attention should be paid to the trend of antibiotic susceptibility in S. pneumoniae.
