Clinical evaluation of cefotaxime for therapy of lower respiratory tract infections. A clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cefotaxime, a new semisynthetic, broad-spectrum cephalosporin, in the therapy of community-and hospital-acquired pneumonias. Thirty-nine males (mean age, 65 years) were treated for 41 episodes of pneumonia. Only five patient did not have a serious underlying disease 15 had two or more significant disorders. Sixty-six percent of these pneumonias were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for all bacterial isolates ranged from 0.008 to 4 micrograms/ml. Peak serum cefotaxime levels during therapy ranged from 12 to 124 micrograms/ml 1 h after a 1-g dose. Satisfactory bacteriological and clinical responses were observed in 85% of the cases. Four episodes of pulmonary superinfections due to cefotaxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli were noted, each in a patient being mechanically ventilated. Pseudomonas was involved in each of these superinfections, and three were fatal. No serious toxicity or adverse reaction to cefotaxime was seen. The results of this study suggest that cefotaxime is an affective and well-tolerated new cephalosporin antimicrobial agent for the therapy of pneumonia due to susceptible organisms.
