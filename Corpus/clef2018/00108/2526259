Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on clarithromycin in the pediatric field. Pediatric Study Group of Clarithromycin. Clarithromycin (TE-031, A-56268), a new macrolide antibiotic agent, was evaluated bacteriologically and clinically for its efficacy and safety in pediatrics by a study group organized with pediatricians from all over the country. A summary of the results of the evaluation is as follows. 1. Absorption and excretion Pharmacokinetics of TE-031 was examined by single oral administration of 10% granules and 50 mg tablets at doses of 1, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg. There were no significant differences between 10% granules and 50 mg tablets, and between administrations before and after meal. Peaks and half-life periods of blood level of TE-031 given once at doses of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg (10% granules) before meal were 1.58, 4.37 and 3.79 micrograms/ml, and 2.53, 3.17 and 2.20 hours, respectively, and the urinary excretion in 6 hours after the administration were about 20-30%. 2. Antibacterial effects TE-031 was proved to have excellent antibacterial effect, i.e., inhibiting growth over 80% of strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.10 micrograms/ml, Branhamella catarrhalis at 0.39 micrograms/ml, and Campylobacter jejuni at 0.78 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococcus aureus, TE-031 showed very similar activity spectrum to EM, and EM resistant strains were also resistant to TE-031. 3. Clinical results A total of 764 cases was studied. Clinical effects of TE-031 were evaluated in 717 cases out of the 764, excluding drop-outs and cases which did not meet specified protocols. Clinically, efficacies of TE-031 were "excellent" in 265 cases and "good" in 161 cases out of 453 cases of Group A in which causal agents were identified, with an efficacy rate of 94.0%, and out of 264 cases of Group B in which pathogens were not detected, clinical effects of TE-031 were "excellent" in 115 cases and "good" in 124 cases, with an efficacy rate of 90.5%. In terms of clinical effects of TE-031 classified by diseases when Group A and B were combined, efficacy rates were 91.6% for upper respiratory tract infection (217/237), 90.0% for bacterial pneumonia (108/120), 97.4% for Mycoplasma pneumonia (111/114), 100% for Chlamydia pneumonia (4/4), 85.0% for pertussis (34/40), 100% for scarlet fever (16/16), 83.9% for skin and soft tissue infection (26/31), and 98.9% for Campylobacter enteritis (87/88).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
