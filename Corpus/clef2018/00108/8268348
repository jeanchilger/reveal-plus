Complications of bacteremia due to Stomatococcus mucilaginosus in neutropenic children. Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity and upper respiratory tract, can cause fatal sepsis and meningitis in neutropenic patients. We identified eight cases of bacteremia due to S. mucilaginosus in children with cancer, of whom five developed complications despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. At the time cultures were positive, seven patients had profound neutropenia (< 100 neutrophils and band forms/mm3) and four had mucositis five had central venous catheters. In two cases, there was unequivocal evidence of catheter-related sepsis. Bacteremia was eradicated in all patients within 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics. Despite prompt instigation of effective antibiotic therapy, the complication rates in this series were high: septic shock (50%), pneumonia (50%), dermatologic manifestations (38%), altered neurological status (25%), meningitis (13%), and adult respiratory distress syndrome (13%). No fatalities were attributable to S. mucilaginosus infection. These cases illustrate the virulence of S. mucilaginosus organisms in neutropenic children and suggest a substantial risk of sequelae even when adequate antibiotic therapy is given.
