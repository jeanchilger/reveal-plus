Pancreaticopleural fistula: demonstration by computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Pancreaticopleural fistula is an uncommon complication of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic trauma. Clinical features include pleural effusion and resulting pulmonary symptoms. Abdominal pain and other clinical manifestations of pancreatitis may be minimal or absent. As in this case, computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography may provide complementary diagnostic information in the evaluation of this condition. A discussion of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of pancreaticopleural fistula is presented.
