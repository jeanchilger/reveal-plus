A resected case of pancreatic carcinoma associated with multiple intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. A 7 1-year-old man, diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), underwent lateral segmentectomy of the liver and partial hepatectomies. Ten months after the hepatic resections, computed tomography imaging of the abdomen revealed a pancreatic tumor and multiple liver metastases of HCC. The patient underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization three times to manage the HCC. Subsequently, he underwent distal pancreatic resection. Although it was a non-curative surgery, the postoperative course was uneventful he was free from cancer pain, and his diabetes improved. At the 7-month follow-up after the pancreatectomy, the patients' course remained uneventful. There have been no reports of resected cases of pancreatic carcinoma that developed during the treatment of multiple intrahepatic recurrence of HCC. In cases wherein recurrence of HCC is well controlled, aggressive treatment for pancreatic cancer can be considered.
