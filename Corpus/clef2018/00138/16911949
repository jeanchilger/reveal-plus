Diagnosis and treatment of solid-pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas. Solid-pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas is a rare exocrine pancreatic tumor. Despite the increasing recognition of the tumor in recent years, its pathogenesis and apparent therapeutic algorithm remain unclear. This study was designed to define the clinical, imaging, and pathologic features and to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this rare disease.The clinical, imaging, and pathologic findings of 9 SPT patients managed in our hospital between 2001 and 2005 were retrospectively analyzed, and related literatures were reviewed.In the 9 patients aged from 14 to 68 years, 8 were female and 1 male. The mean age of these patients at diagnosis was 30 years. Initially, 8 patients complained of vague abdominal pain and one patient had pancreatic mass detected incidentally by abdominal CT. The levels of blood and urine amylase and tumor markers were all within the normal range. B-US, CT and MRI demonstrated that tumors were well encapsulated and contained some degree of internal hemorrhage or cystic degeneration. The mean transverse diameter of these tumors was 5.4 cm (range, 2-10.5 cm). The tumors were located at the head (2 patients), body (2), body and tail junction (4), and tail (1) of the pancreas. Surgical procedures included pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, and enucleation. Histological examination showed solidified cystic areas and papillary protrusions. Two malignant tumors demonstrated retroperitoneal metastases and vascular invasion. Follow-up for 2.5 years on average showed that one patient died of tumor recurrence at 10 months and the rest were alive.SPT exhibits unique clinical and pathologic features and is readily diagnosed by its characteristic imaging and histological appearance. Surgical resection of the primary tumor and metastases is the treatment of choice.
