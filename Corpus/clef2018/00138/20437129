Usefulness of computed tomography enteroclysis in the intestinal tract. The aim of this study was to evaluate computed tomography enteroclysis (CTE) of the small intestinal tract.A total of 36 patients underwent CTE for further examination of small intestinal disease.The indications were obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB) (n = 16), suspected Crohn's disease (n = 7), suspected and diagnosed by exclusion a small intestinal tumor (n = 5), and others (n = 8). Regarding OGIB, positive findings were observed in nine patients: angiodysplasia (n = 2), suspected ileac tumor (n = 2), colon cancer (n = 1), colon diverticulosis and diverticulitis (n = 2), Crohn's disease (n = 1), and enteritis (n = 1). As for Crohn's disease, hyperplasia of the small intestinal wall was shown in six patents. Positive findings of a small intestinal tumor were observed in two patients. In the "others" category, colon diverticulitis was found in three patients and isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery in one of four patients with abdominal pain. Primary carcinoid was identified in the pancreas in one patient, with liver carcinoid metastasis in the remaining four patients.CT enteroclysis is a noninvasive method and useful approach in the diagnosis of small intestinal diseases.
