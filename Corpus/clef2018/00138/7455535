Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreaticography (ERCP) and computer tomography in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, pseudocysts and carcinoma of the pancreas--a comparison (author's transl). In 107 patients, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) and computer tomography (CT) were performed at a short time interval. The combined use of ERCP and CT yielded a correct diagnosis in chronic pancreatitis in 92% of the patients pseudocysts were diagnosed correctly in 100% of the cases, whereas the rate of accuracy in carcinomas was 94%. In chronic pancreatitis, ERCP usually gave clear and comprehensive information. CT proved a valuable additional examination method wherever the findings did not supply a clear answer. Both examination method were ideally complementary in pseudocysts, so that ERCP and CT were found to be appropriate in each case. In carcinoma, ERCP proved superior to primary diagnosis, whereas CT served to confirm the findings and to assess the volume occupied by the tumor.
