Duodenal diverticula mimicking cystic neoplasms of the pancreas: CT and MR imaging findings in seven patients. Duodenal diverticula are common and are typically asymptomatic. When filled with gas or a combination of fluid and gas, duodenal diverticula are easily recognized on CT or MR imaging. However, a duodenal diverticulum that is entirely filled with fluid may mimic a cystic neoplasm arising from the head of the pancreas. We present seven cases of patients with duodenal diverticula in whom initial findings on CT or MR imaging were suggestive of a cystic neoplasm in the head of the pancreas. In all patients, this structure was ultimately proven to be a duodenal diverticula.When filled with only fluid, a duodenal diverticulum may mimic a cystic neoplasm in the head of the pancreas. Recognizing the location in which this entity characteristically arises and identifying small amounts of intradiverticular gas when it is present may aid in establishing the correct diagnosis in patients with duodenal diverticula.
