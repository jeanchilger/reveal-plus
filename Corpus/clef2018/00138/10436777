MRI and MRCP in pancreaticobiliary malignancy. Ultrasonography and CT scanning have been the standard techniques for demonstrating pancreatic carcinoma, although MR and more recently even endoscopic ultrasound have shown excellent results. MRCP is a specialized MR technique that shows fluid containing structures in a 2D image display similar to direct ERCP findings. Accuracy of MRCP (sensitivity, specificity) equals or exceeds ERCP for both biliary and pancreatic duct morphology. MRCP does not provide information with regard resectability. MRI can be applied to pancreaticobiliary malignancies as conventional MR, as MR angiography/venography or as MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The technique and applications of each method differ. Although all have been well documented in the literature, their clinical role when compared to other evolving technologies such as helical CT and endoscopic ultrasound is still evolving.
