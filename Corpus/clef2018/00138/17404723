MR imaging appearance of insulinoma in an infant. Insulinoma is a very rare pancreatic neoplasm of childhood. Early recognition of insulinoma is important to ensure proper surgical treatment and prevent serious adverse neurological consequences. We describe here a case of insulinoma in an infant who presented with seizures and abnormal behaviour. Random blood glucose was found to be abnormally low (40 mg/dl). MRI showed a well-encapsulated mass (hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images) at the junction of the head and body of the pancreas. The tumour was successfully enucleated. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of insulinoma.
