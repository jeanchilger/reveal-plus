Pancreatic pseudotumors: computed tomography. Although pancreatic disease is suspected initially by historical or biochemical findings, the nature of the pathologic process in the past was frequently established only through invasive procedures. Inferences can be drawn from routine roentgenologic examinations, but visualization of the pancreas has only recently been achieved. Of the currently available noninvasive imaging procedures, computed tomography, in our opinion, is the screening procedure of choice. Care in the interpretation of pancreatic masses must be exercised since some of the findings can be attributed to anatomic variants, normal adjacent structures, or other neighboring pathologic processes.
