A case of intramedullary spinal cavitation after minor trauma. A case of surgically treated intramedullary spinal cavity which appeared 1 year after a minor injury was presented. A 15 year-old boy developed nuchalgia and muscle weakness of his right arm and leg. On admission, he had right hemiparesis and sensory disturbances in the right C6-C8 and left T1-S5 dermatomes. Metrizamide-CT scan and MRI disclosed an intramedullary spinal cavity between C4-C5 vertebral levels. A myelotomy and a biopsy of the cavity wall were carried out in order to communicate the cavity with the subarachnoid space, and to make a definite diagnosis. The microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen revealed no tumor findings but inflammation. Taking into account the location of the cavity, a site corresponding with the site of a previous trauma, the authors finally diagnosed the cavity as intramedullary spinal cavitation after minor trauma. His symptoms improved remarkably after the operation.
