Another barrier to regeneration in the CNS: activated macrophages induce extensive retraction of dystrophic axons through direct physical interactions. Injured axons of the adult CNS undergo lengthy retraction from the initial site of axotomy after spinal cord injury. Macrophage infiltration correlates spatiotemporally with this deleterious phenomenon, but the direct involvement of these inflammatory cells has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we examined the role of macrophages in axonal retraction within the dorsal columns after spinal cord injury in vivo and found that retraction occurred between days 2 and 28 after lesion and that the ends of injured axons were associated with ED-1+ cells. Clodronate liposome-mediated depletion of infiltrating macrophages resulted in a significant reduction in axonal retraction however, we saw no evidence of regeneration. We used time-lapse imaging of adult dorsal root ganglion neurons in an in vitro model of the glial scar to examine macrophage-axon interactions and observed that adhesive contacts and considerable physical interplay between macrophages and dystrophic axons led to extensive axonal retraction. The induction of retraction was dependent on both the growth state of the axon and the activation state of the macrophage. Only dystrophic adult axons were susceptible to macrophage "attack." Unlike intrinsically active cell line macrophages, both primary macrophages and microglia required activation to induce axonal retraction. Contact with astrocytes had no deleterious effect on adult dystrophic axons, suggesting that the induction of extensive retraction was specific to phagocytic cells. Our data are the first to indicate a direct role of activated macrophages in axonal retraction by physical cell-cell interactions with injured axons.
