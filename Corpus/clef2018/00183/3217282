Role of magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional computerized tomography in craniovertebral junction anomalies. The surgical management of craniovertebral junction abnormalities depends on accurate radiological identification of the static and dynamic relationships. Four cases are presented to show the importance of flexion/extension magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional computerized tomography scanning in the evaluation of these relationships. With these techniques, anterior and/or posterior decompressive procedures can be appropriately planned to reduce and stabilize craniovertebral abnormalities. Long-term neural deficits can be reversed by these procedures.
