Percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation for temporary internal bracing of nondisplaced bony Chance fractures. Although many patients with unstable Chance fractures can heal in an external brace, others will require internal stabilization. Short-segment minimally invasive internal bracing of a Chance fracture offers the rigidity and patient compliance of internal bracing with minimal tissue disruption. This technique has not yet been described.A healthy 16-year-old female and 21-year-old male sustained classic nondisplaced Chance fractures. They were both neurologically intact.An image-guided Jamshidi needle was used to percutaneously place K-wires to direct percutaneous pedicle screws. Freehand percutaneous passing of rods to connect the pedicle screw heads on each side created a short-segment construct.Minimally invasive internal bracing of nondisplaced bony Chance fractures is an option for selected neurologically intact patients unable to tolerate external bracing.
