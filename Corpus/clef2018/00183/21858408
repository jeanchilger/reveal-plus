Abducens nerve palsy due to postraumatic retroclival and spinal subdural hematoma: case report and literature review. Retroclival posttraumatic hematomas are extremely rare and almost exclusive to childhood. Only one case of retroclival subdural hematoma has been reported in the literature to date.An 8-year-old boy suffered a severe head injury with cervical hyperextension as the result of a bicycle accident. On admission his initial Glasgow Coma Score was 13 and he had diplopia due to right palsy of the VI nerve. A retroclival subdural hematoma was observed by CT and MRI of the craneovertebral junction. Management was conservative and a rigid collar was placed. Palsy of VI nerve recovered spontaneously at 6 days and at discharge the patient had only cervical pain. Follow up at 3 months after the accident showed clinical and radiological resolution.Traumatic retroclival hematomas are mainly a pediatric entity due to immaturity of the cranio-cervical junction. Treatment consists of placement of a rigid collar although clinical progression may require surgical evacuation.
