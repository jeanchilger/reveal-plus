Spinal Langerhans' cell histiocytosis in a young adult: case report and therapeutic considerations. We report an unusual case of spinal Langerhans' cell histiocytosis of the cervicothoracic junction in a young adult man. A 17-year-old male was referred to our institution with a 3-week history of cervicothoracic pain associated to a weakness of his right upper limb. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a collapsed T1 vertebral body with epidural soft tissue showing mass effect on spinal cord. The patient underwent a classic anterior cervicotomy. Complete removal of the lesion could be achieved, but the soft consistency of C7 and T2 body precluded a solid anterior fixation and an extended resection of C7 and T2 body had to be performed. Then a C6 - T3 stabilisation using an anterior plate fixation and cyanomethylacrylate graft was performed. Postoperative course was uneventful. At 2 years follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and radiological workup showed a perfect stability of anterior fixation system. Aggressive surgical management of eosinophilic granuloma should be considered in some selected cases particularly when spinal instability or neurological deficit occurs. In this young patient a modified anterior cervicotomy allowed a comfortable approach to the anterior aspect of T3 vertebra for spinal fixation.
