Cervicomedullary compression in young patients with achondroplasia: value of comprehensive neurologic and respiratory evaluation. We studied prospectively 26 young patients with achondroplasia to test two hypotheses: that respiratory problems may be the result of occult spinal cord compression, and that achondroplastic patients with cord compression might have occult respiratory abnormalities. Respiratory abnormalities were present in 85%, the majority caused by a primary problem of the pulmonary system, such as small thoracic cage or obstructed airway. Three patients had hypoxemia, recurrent cyanotic spells, and episodes of respiratory distress explainable only by cervicomedullary cord compression in each patient, respiratory problems were alleviated by decompressive surgery. Another six patients with cervicomedullary compression had, in addition, at least one primary pulmonary cause of respiratory problems. After decompressive surgery the respiratory problems improved in three and were unchanged in three. Reconstructed sagittal CT images proved the most sensitive technique for detecting craniocervical stenosis as a cause of cervicomedullary cord compression, although some degree of stenosis was present in nearly all of the patients.
