Cystic cord lesions and neurological deterioration in spinal cord injury: operative considerations based on magnetic resonance imaging. In a retrospective review of 94 consecutive patients with past spinal cord injury referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the evaluation of new neurological symptoms, 59% were found to have cystic spinal cord lesions. Twelve of these patients underwent surgical cyst drainage, half having presented with increased myelopathy, and half with ascent of the neurological level. All of the operated cysts were greater than 2 cm in diameter (mean 15.8 cm), and 4 had areas of signal void indicating turbulent flow. All 12 patients had clinical improvement following surgery. The future prospective use of MRI in patients with longstanding spinal cord injury may prove valuable in the identification of patients with syrinx formation, at risk of developing neurological deterioration, who may benefit from early cyst drainage. At present, however, the decision to operate on these patients should be based primarily on clinical criteria.
