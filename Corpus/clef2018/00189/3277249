Acute cervical spine trauma: evaluation with 1.5-T MR imaging. Twenty-one patients with acute neurologic deficits following cervical spine trauma were evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (n = 21), computed tomography enhanced with intrathecal contrast material (CT myelography) (n = 18), myelography (n = 13), cervical spine radiography (n = 21), and intraoperative sonography (n = 7). MR imaging proved superior to other modalities in demonstrating parenchymal spinal cord injuries and cervical intervertebral disk herniation. Although both T1- and T2-weighted studies appear necessary to evaluate the anatomic relationship of the spinal cord, thecal space, intervertebral disks, and surrounding osseous and ligamentous structures, T2-weighted sequences were more sensitive than T1-weighted studies for detection of spinal cord injury. CT myelography was superior to MR imaging in demonstrating cervical spine fractures. In most cases, myelography revealed no information that was not apparent from both CT and MR imaging studies. Preliminary experience with MR imaging of acute cervical spine trauma suggests that it should be the study of choice in symptomatic patients who are otherwise clinically stable. CT may still be required in selected patients to evaluate complex fractures.
