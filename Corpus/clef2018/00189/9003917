The cervical spine in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Twenty patients with a diagnosis of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome had their cervical spine radiographs reviewed. Radiologic abnormalities including vertebral fusion were present in 9 of the 20 patients. Fusion of both the vertebral bodies and the posterior elements was noted, although the latter site was more common. C2-3 was the level most commonly involved, although other levels were recorded. Analysis of sequential radiographs in nine patients revealed evidence of progression in seven patients. In those studies in children aged under 2 years, only 1 of 18 films showed evidence of fusion, while in those over 2 years of age, 10 of 12 showed evidence of fusion. These results reveal that the incidence of cervical anomalies in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is greater than that in the general population. There is both direct and indirect evidence that the vertebral fusions are progressive during childhood.
