Congenital muscular dystrophy and rigid spine syndrome. In three patients with muscular dystrophy, the unexpected occurrence of spinal stiffness suggested a diagnosis of rigid spine syndrome. One case belongs to the benign form of the congenital muscular dystrophies in the other cases however, the severity and the distribution of the muscular process, associated with neurological abnormalities, seems to correspond to a unique variant of congenital muscular dystrophy. These observations underline the heterogeneity of the rigid spine syndrome.
