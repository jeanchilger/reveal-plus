18F-FDG PET/CT for image-guided and intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Advances in technology have allowed extremely precise control of radiation dose delivery and localization within a patient. The ability to confidently delineate target tumor boundaries, however, has lagged behind. (18)F-FDG PET/CT, with its ability to distinguish metabolically active disease from normal tissue, may provide a partial solution to this problem. Here we review the current applications of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in a variety of disease sites, including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This review focuses on the use of (18)F-FDG PET/CT to aid in planning radiotherapy and the associated benefits and challenges. We also briefly consider novel radiopharmaceuticals that are beginning to be used in the context of radiotherapy planning.
