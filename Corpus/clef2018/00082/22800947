Positron emission tomography plus VEEG in the localization of epileptic foci in negative-MRI interact epilepsy. To explore the application value of positron emission tomography (PET) in the localization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-negative epileptogenic focus.Brain images of 18fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) and 13N-NH3·H2O-PET, MRI and video electroencephalography (VEEG) were obtained in 65 patients. Preoperative and postoperative localizations were compared in MRI-negative patients. And the results of PET and VEEG were compared between the MRI-positive and MRI-negative groups.MRI scans were normal in 26 cases and abnormal in 35 cases. Sixty-one patients had interictal epileptiform discharge on VEEG (brain regions, n = 12 multiple brain areas, n = 16PET imaging is both sensitive and effective in the detection and localization of epileptogenic foci. Especially for MRI-negative cases, it is an indispensable tool of localizing epileptogenic foci.
