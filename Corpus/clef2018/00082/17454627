Comparison of (18)F Flurodeoxyglucose PET with Ga-67 scintigraphy and conventional imaging modalities in pediatric lymphoma. Flurodeoxyglucose PET (FDG PET) is very useful for staging and restaging adult lymphomas. Its effectiveness in childhood lymphomas is less established. To evaluate the potential utility of FDG PET in the care of pediatric patients with lymphomas, we examined the clinical data and imaging findings of 26 patients, 8 - 19 years of age (14 HD, 12 NHL) who underwent 55 FDG PET studies. Results were compared with CT/MRI and gallium scans. FDG PET provided incremental, clinically important information in 21% of HD cases and 33% of NHL cases. It was especially useful in distinguishing scar tissue from residual disease at the end of therapy. In both HD and NHL, FDG PET had higher sensitivity (94%, 90%) and specificity (100%, 88%) than CT/MRI and gallium scanning. These results indicate that FDG PET is useful in the management of pediatric lymphomas.
