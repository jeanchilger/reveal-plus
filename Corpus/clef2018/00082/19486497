Detection of atypical cultivable canine gastric Helicobacter strain and its biochemical and morphological characters in naturally infected dogs. Helicobacter-like organisms are frequently found in canine stomachs, but the relationship between such organisms and gastric pathology has not been established. However, some such organisms have zoonotic importance. The aims of this study were to evaluate the morphological and biochemical characteristics of cultivable canine gastric Helicobacter-like organisms (GHLOs) in pets and stray dogs and their prevalence in these two groups of dogs. Specimens were taken by gastroscopy from 30 clinically healthy stray dogs and 30 pet dogs. Cultures were positive from biopsies of 11/30 of stray and 6/30 of pet dogs. The isolated Helicobacters were observed by light microscopy and studied by biochemical, physiological and PCR analysis. Some of the isolated GHLO's displayed atypical shapes that were similar to Helicobacter pylori or Helicobacter acinonychis in stray dogs' cytological examinations. They had 2-3 helices and were smaller than other canine GHLOs. One of these atypical Helicobacter strains was cultured. It was not possible to distinguish such strains by routine PCR and biochemical evaluations. Electron microscopy showed a smaller Helicobacter (2 microm in length) with 2 or 3 helixes. This study demonstrates that not all canine gastric Helicobacters are 5-15 microm in length, as has been previously proposed, and portrays the need for further investigation of canine GHLOs.
