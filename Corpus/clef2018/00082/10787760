The current status of positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography (PET), invented over 25 years ago, is the only imaging technique that provides images of the biological basis of disease. Since disease is a biological process, PET routinely detects disease when other imaging studies, such as CT and MRI, are normal. In addition to its clinical effectiveness, PET has been shown to reduce costs, primarily due to the elimination of other less accurate diagnostic tests and ineffective surgeries. PET has been determined to be applicable to a number of specific applications in the areas of: imaging cancer patients, characterizing myocardial blood flow and viability, and brain imaging in various physiological and pathologic conditions. Tremendous progress has been made in resolving the regulatory and reimbursement issues facing the field of PET. Working with HCFA, representatives of the Institute for Clinical PET and the Society of Nuclear Medicine have brought about expanded HCFA coverage for PET. When HCFA first authorized payment for PET, all coverage decisions were restricted to HCFA and an expanded national coverage policy. HCFA revised its national coverage policy in 1997 this was the first of several steps taken by HCFA towards careful expansion of PET reimbursement. In March 1999, three new indications for whole-body PET scans were added to Medicare's coverage policy. The Institute for Clinical PET is continuing to work with HCFA on continued, appropriate expansion of the coverage policy. This article is partially excerpted from a written statement made by Terry Douglass, Ph.D., president of CTI, Inc., on May 12, 1999, before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and its Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. This was part of the committee's study of "Emerging Technologies in the New Millennium."
