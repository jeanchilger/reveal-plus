Hemodynamic characteristics of the brain in angiogenic cochleovestibulopathies and lipid distress syndrome (Communication 2--radionuclide diagnosis). Radionuclide tracing employed to study arterial and venous blood supply to the brain in 100 patients with angiogenic cochleovestibulopathies and lipid distress syndrome has provided information on perfusion of the brain, arterial and venous hemodynamics with reference to the form of cochleovestibular disorders and atherosclerotic defects of extra- and intracranial cerebral arteries.
