Whole-body MRI and FDG PET fused images for evaluation of patients with cancer. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the feasibility of fused whole-body MRI and PET for the evaluation of patients with cancer.MRI has proven to be superior to CT for studying several regions of the body, and PET FDG has become an established diagnostic tool in oncology. Because FDG accumulates avidly in tumor tissue, fusing FDG PET to whole-body MRI allows good anatomy-based evaluation of disease.
