Radiofrequency thermocoagulation of lung tumours. Where we are, where we are headed. Only 25% of all lung cancers are diagnosed in an early stage allowing surgical treatment. Primary tumours usually concerning lung metastasis are breast, colon, kidney, uterus/cervix, prostate, and head and neck tumours. During recent years many publications have confirmed the effectiveness and reliability of lung radiofrequency ablation (RFA) alone or together with other techniques (chemotherapy, radiotherapy...). Results suggest that survival increase and curative rates of lung radiofrequency are similar to those achieved by more aggressive procedures and present lower rates of complications. Pneumothorax, pleural effusion and alveolar haemorrhage are the most frequent complications. Indications for lung RFA must be individually evaluated by lung cancer committees. Percutaneous lung RFA may be useful in patients with pulmonary primary tumours and metastases, especially in those with nodules smaller than 3 cm and a peripheral location (>1 cm from the hilum). PET/CT seems to be the most accurate technique in patient follow up.
