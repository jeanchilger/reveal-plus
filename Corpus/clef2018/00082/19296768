Pathophysiology of coronary artery disease: the case for multiparametric imaging. Interventions to treat coronary artery disease are available but they must be targeted at the correct individuals (and indeed lesions), in order to gain maximal benefit with the minimal adverse effects. Coronary contrast angiography is not able to provide all the information required for the assessment of the effects of artery disease. Other imaging modalities are of growing importance as they can reduce radiation exposure and invasiveness of screening, as well as providing important extra information. The ideal 'multiparametric' imaging technique would assess anatomy, viability and lesion activity in a single quick scan. Currently, MRI is the technology closest to achieving this ideal, although the existing technology still has some limitations. This review discusses the currently available techniques for the imaging of coronary anatomy and of myocardial viability, and considers their benefits and limitations. We also discuss the developing field of imaging molecularly targeted to active coronary lesions. Finally we provide a 5-year view of the current and likely future optimal imaging strategies.
