Passive smoking and canine lung cancer risk. A case-control study was conducted to determine whether household exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is associated with an increased risk for lung cancer in pet dogs. Lung cancer cases and controls with other forms of cancer were obtained from two veterinary teaching hospitals during 1985-1987. Exposures assessed included the number of smokers in the household, the amount smoked, and the proportion of time spent indoors by the pet. A weak relation was found for exposure to a smoker in the home (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval 0.7-3.7), after controlling for confounding in stratified analyses. Strong evidence for a further increase in risk associated with more than one smoker in the home was not found, nor was a significant trend observed for increasing number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day or an exposure index based on number of smokers in each household, packs smoked per day, and the proportion of time the dog spent within the home. However, skull shape appeared to exert effect modification the risk was restricted to breeds with short and medium length noses (odds ratio = 2.4, 95% confidence interval 0.7-7.8). Despite the inconclusive findings of the current study, epidemiologic studies in pet animals may add to our understanding of environmental tobacco smoke effects in human populations.
