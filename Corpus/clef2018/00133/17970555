Congenital and developmental pancreatic anomalies: ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging features. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the most common anatomic, congenital, and developmental anomalies of the pancreas. Familiarity with the imaging appearances of these anomalies as well as the range of normal appearance is important to differentiate them from other conditions, especially since some of these variants are commonly encountered. Basic knowledge of the normal embryology is of utmost importance to be able to recognize these disorders.
