The natural history of resected pancreatic cancer without adjuvant chemotherapy. Diagnostic imaging, surgical care, and perioperative morbidity and mortality have significantly improved for patients undergoing resections for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This study was undertaken to define the natural history and patterns of recurrence of resected pancreatic cancer without neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies using current standards of care. Sixty-one patients underwent pancreatectomy without neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Tumors were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification system. CT scans were obtained every 3 months and recurrence categorized as: liver only, local, distant, multiple sites, or clinical. Median survival after pancreatectomy was 12 months. Cancer recurred in 51 (84%) patients. The radiographic site of initial recurrence did not generally impact survival patients initially recurring at multiple sites had significantly abbreviated median survival of 5.6 months. AJCC stage was found to correlate with disease-free and overall survival, although tumor size alone did not. The presence of lymphatic metastasis correlated with disease-free but not overall survival. Overall survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy remains poor in the absence of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. AJCC stage is the best predictor of disease-free and overall survival
