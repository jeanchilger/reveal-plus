Imaging of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors. Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors are rare neoplasms that cause classic clinical syndromes because of the excess secretion of specific gastrointestinal hormones. The two most important tumors clinically are insulinomas and gastrinomas. The clinical management of patients with these disorders usually involves the localization and surgical removal of the responsible tumor. Many radiological techniques can be used for tumor localization, including preoperative and intraoperative ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, CT, MRI, radionuclide scanning, angiography, and venous sampling. However, there are conflicting claims as to the relative accuracy of these procedures, and many of these investigations are difficult to justify because of their high cost, degree of invasiveness, or lack of precise anatomic information that is obtained. If surgical resection of a neuroendocrine tumor is planned, intraoperative sonography should always be used to detect occult nonpalpable tumors and to discern the relationship of the tumor to vital adjacent pancreatic ductal anatomy. The choice of preoperative imaging is more controversial, and depends on the clinical problem, local expertise, and availability of imaging techniques. Sonography and contrast-enhanced helical CT are the most commonly used preoperative imaging methods, because of their relatively low cost and widespread availability. Radionuclide scanning with a somatostatin analogue, which is a relatively new procedure, may be valuable in patients with symptoms of tumor recurrence.
