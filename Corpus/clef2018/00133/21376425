Signet ring cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. Signet ring cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is a rare entity and less than 20 cases have been described in the literature. We report the cases of two patients with this disease and provide a literature review of previous studies.We describe two patients with obstructive jaundice. Abdominal ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography showed dilatation of the intrahepatic and common bile duct. Duodenoscopy indicated a protruding mass on the ampulla of Vater. Histopathological examination showed round cells and their nuclei were located on one side with prominent signet-ring features. One patient underwent a cephalic pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy and the other a total pancreatectomy.Signet ring cell carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater has only been described in isolated cases in the literature.
