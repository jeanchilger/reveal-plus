Surgical approach for lung cancer with multiple pulmonary nodules. A computed tomography (CT) and high-resolution CT (HRCT) have provided us an increasing opportunity to find multiple small pulmonary nodules, which sometimes appear ground glass opacity (GGO). Recently, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) had a great contribution to our assessment for these small pulmonary nodules. However, since it is yet difficult to establish a diagnosis for these nodules during preoperative workup, a surgical lung biopsy is often required for an accurate diagnosis. We have experienced 9 patients who had undergone lung resection for primary lung cancer accompanied by multiple pulmonary lesions. Since the multiple lesions were consisted of malignant and benign lesions, it is still uncertain whether excessive lung resection should be performed in such patients. In this brief article, we summarized the characteristics of the pulmonary lesions in those patients and discussed difficulty of preoperative diagnosis, viability of pulmonary resection and problems underlining a surgical treatment.
