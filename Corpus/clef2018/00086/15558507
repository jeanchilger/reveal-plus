Response to radiation. Computed tomography (CT) has traditionally been the standard radiographic modality for diagnosing and monitoring non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after treatment. Given the limitations of CT, the utility of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been investigated for the management of NSCLC, with promising findings. Its adjunctive role with CT in diagnosing and staging disease is well established. FDG-PET also has been found to be a valuable tool for radiation treatment planning because it improves the precision of lesion definition. More recently, its value for determining clinical response both during and after treatment has been explored. This review highlights the various applications of FDG-PET in the diagnosis and management of NSCLC as corroborated by clinical data, with considerations of future directions.
