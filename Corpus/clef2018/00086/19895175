The utility of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy for assessment of lung lesions in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Our aim was to assess clinical utility of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC scintigraphy for evaluation of lung lesions in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the thorax and whole body scintigraphy were performed in 34 patients using 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-TOC. Visual assessment was complemented by semiquantitative evaluation based on tumor to non-tumor (T/NT) ratio. Clinical, laboratory, and histological findings served as the standard for comparison. Enhanced tracer uptake was observed on both SPECT and whole body scintigraphy in 29 of 34 patients (88% sensitivity). T/NT ratios were significantly higher on SPECT than whole body images (2.96+/-1.07 vs.1.70+/-0.43, p99mTc-EDDA/Hynic-TOC, lung involvement of NETs, T/NT ratio.
