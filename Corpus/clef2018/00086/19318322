The advantage of Positron Emission Tomography combined with Computer Tomography (PET-CT) in the diagnosis of lung cancer (experience with 408 patients). The authors analyzed the results of PET-CT scans made with oncological indications among 408 patients. One hundred and fifty-four PET-CTs were done to characterize pulmonary foci, after which in 59 cases lung surgery was performed. The method's sensitivity in respect to malignancy was 100%, specificity was 56%. Staging of affected lymph nodes resulted in 17 mediastinoscopies and 54 thoracotomies. In the former indications PET-CT-positive lymph nodes always need cytologic/histologic verification. M-staging done with PET-CT was performed in 141 cases, mediastinal restaging of patients having received neoadjuvant chemotherapy was done in 24 cases. The latter indications we consider superfluous because of the diagnostic inaccuracy of PET-CT. In 175 cases we analyzed the frequently determining factor of the PET-CT scan in the indication of lung surgery. The authors wish to share their experience for the better use of this method and to accelerate the inclusion of PET-CT into the diagnostic protocol.
