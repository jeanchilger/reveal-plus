Evaluation of tumour metabolism and multidrug resistance in patients with treated malignant lymphomas. The management of patients with treated malignant lymphomas requires functional methods to differentiate a residual soft tissue mass. Patients with treated Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL, n = 20, 68 malignant lesions, three benign lesions) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 26, 46 malignant lesions, one benign lesion) were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) and fluorine-18 deoxyglucose (FDG). Oxygen-15 labelled water was used (n = 14, 25 lesions) in addition to FDG in order to obtain information on the tissue perfusion. Long-term follow-up studies with PET and FDG were performed in nine patients up to 511 days after the initiation of second-line therapy. Fourteen patients underwent single-photon emission tomography (SPET) with technetium-99m sestamibi immediately prior to the first PET examination. PET with FDG displays a high sensitivity for the detection of viable tumour tissue, all the malignant lesions being correctly classified in this study. The possible limitations are inflammatory processes, which may obscure tumour detection due to increased FDG uptake, and malignant lesions with low FDG uptake due to reduced perfusion. Difficulties exist in the prognosis of long-term response, since the change in FDG uptake may be variable. Long-term therapy outcome was correlated with the slope values obtained from the standardized integral uptake (SIU) data, which provides a new approach for the evaluation of PET follow-up studies. 99mTc-sestamibi, which should reflect the multidrug resistance, was evaluated with respect to therapy outcome. A high uptake of 99mTc-sestamibi was observed in patients with stable disease or better. The data support the hypothesis that sestamibi may reflect multidrug resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
