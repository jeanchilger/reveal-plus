Metastatic seminoma and grade 1 follicular lymphoma presenting concurrently in a supraclavicular lymph node: a case report. An asymptomatic 67-year-old man presented with a left supraclavicular lymph node that enlarged over a 2-month period which was biopsied. Pathologic features were consistent with involvement by metastatic seminoma and follicular lymphoma, follicular pattern, grade 1 (of 3). Staging Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography scans indicated several areas of enlarged lymph nodes. The patient completed chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin chemotherapy. This is the first reported case of metastatic seminoma and follicular lymphoma occurring in the same lymph node. No obvious pathophysiologic link exists between these two malignancies and there are no shared common risk factors. Given the natural history of these two malignancies, if this patient develops recurrent lymphadenopathy, it will be difficult to identify whether the enlarged lymph nodes represent recurrent seminoma or follicular lymphoma without a biopsy of each pathologically enlarged node. Similarly, Fluorodeoxyglucose- Positron Emission Tomography is known to be active in both seminoma and follicular lymphoma, making this scan non-specific in this patient. Finally, this patient had no baseline elevation in any germ cell tumor marker. Thus, serum tumor markers cannot be relied upon as surrogates for response to chemotherapy or as identifiers of relapsed seminoma.
