Application of positron emission tomography molecular probes in hepatocellular carcinoma biological imaging. Biological behavior is a hot issue in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) study. Positron emission tomography (PET), a biological imaging technique, has been widely applied in many types of tumors. It is capable of noninvasive detection of biological behavior. Different radiotracers provide different information of HCC, including glucose/lipid metabolism, DNA synthesis, and apoptosis. In addition, radiotracer uptake relates to biological and clinical prognostic markers. In this article we review the application of several existing and novel radiotracers in PET in HCC study.
