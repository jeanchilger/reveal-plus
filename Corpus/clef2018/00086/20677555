99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2 uptake kinetics difference among KMB17 human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast and different human lung cancer cells. PET/CT imaging is expensive, so searching the tumor imaging agent for SPECT/CT is necessary. 99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2 [bis (N-ethoxy-N-ethyl dithiocarbamato) nitrido 99Tc(m) (V)] can be uptaken by lung cancer cells and other cells alike. The aim of this study is to evaluate the distinctive value in lung tumor with 99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2, the difference in its uptake kinetics in human embryonic lung diploid fibroblasts KMB17 and several kinds of lung cancer cells lines.Firstly, six different cell culture medium which contained YTMLC Gejiu human lung squamous carcinoma cell, SPC-A1 human lung adenocarcinoma cell, AGZY low metastatic human lung adenocarcinoma, 973 high metastatic human lung adenocarcinoma cell, GLC-82 Gejiu human lung adenocarcinoma cell, and KMB17 human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast, respectively with equal cell density of 1 x 10(6)/mL and the same volume were prepared secondly, the same radioactive dose of 99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2 was added into each sample and then 300 microL mixed sample was taken out respectively and cultured in 37 degrees C culture boxStatistical difference was found among six cell samples, and the uptake rate sequence from high to low is 973 and SPC-A1 > YTMLC > GLC-82 > AGZY > KMB17 respectively furthermore, 30 min-45 min after culture, the uptake rate reached stability, and the 45 min uptake rate of each sample was higher than its 96.7% uptake peak.Based on the results above mentioned, it is supposed that there are discriminative clinical value when using 99Tc(m) -N(NOEt)2 as a tumor targeting imaging agent, and 30 min or so after injection may be the best imaging time in the early imaging stage.
