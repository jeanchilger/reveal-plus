A case of secondary pulmonary malignant lymphoma with multiple pulmonary nodules and spiculation. A 72-year-old man presented to our hospital with fatigue and anemia. Chest CT showed multiple nodular shadows. We first suspected lung cancer and multiple metastatic lesions because some nodules had spiculation. However, PET-CT revealed the small intestine, thyroid and rib as well as these nodules to be positive for FDG uptake, suggesting malignant lymphoma and lung involvement. For diagnosis, lung biopsy by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) was performed. Pathologic examination of the lung biopsy specimen showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We diagnosed secondary pulmonary malignant lymphoma.
