Dynamic MRI defecography vs. entero-colpo-cysto-defecography in the evaluation of midline pelvic floor hernias in female pelvic floor disorders. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic efficacy of dynamic MR defecography (MR-D) with entero-colpo-cysto-defecography (ECCD) in the assessment of midline pelvic floor hernias (MPH) in female pelvic floor disorders.From August 2004 to August 2010, 3,006 female patients who required ECCD for the evaluation of pelvic floor disorders were enrolled in this study. All the 1,160 patients with ECCD findings of MPH were asked to undergo MR-D 1,142 accepted to undergo MR-D and constituted the object of analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee. All the patients gave their written informed consent to take part in the study.Overall, the prevalence of MPH at ECCD was higher if compared with that at MR-D. Concerning the hernia content, there were significantly more enteroceles and sigmoidoceles on ECCD than on MR-D, whereas, in relation to the hernia development modalities, the prevalence of elytroceles, edroceles, and Douglas' hernias at ECCD was significantly higher than that at MR-D. In spite of a 100% specificity, the sensibility of MR-D in the detection of an omentocele, sigmoidocele, and enterocele was, respectively, 95%, 82%, and 65%, showing an inferior diagnostic capacity if compared with that of ECCD.MR-D shows lower sensitivity than ECCD in the detection of MPH development. The less-invasive MR-D may have a role in a better evaluation of the entire pelvic anatomy and pelvic organ interaction especially in patients with multicompartmental defects, planned for surgery.
