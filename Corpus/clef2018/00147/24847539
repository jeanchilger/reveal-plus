Stage IV stenosing sqamous cell carcinoma of the oesopahgus in a 41 year-old woman. A case presentation. To present a clinical case of a 41 year-old woman, with a stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus.We present a clinical case of 41 year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and resection of a haemosiderin plaque on the tongue. A space occupying lesion (SOL) was studied using ultrasound and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), detecting, but unable to differentiate, a gradually increasing haemangioma or hepatocarcinoma. She was seen at the clinic due to dysphagia and loss of weight. In oesophagogastroscopy with biopsy a squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus was diagnosed. The Computed Tomography (CT) of the neck, thorax and abdomen showed a stenosing tumour in the oesophagus with metastasis in the lungs and left adrenal gland, and a SOL in the liver compatible with a neo-formative process. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm. She was referred to Surgery and Oncology, who performed a gastrostomy for enteral feeding and started treatment with palliative chemotherapy.Squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus is very frequent. The two most important risk factors are alcoholism and nicotine poisoning. The dysphagia is the most common symptom (96% of the patients). The prognosis is a poor, with high mortality. Surgery is the standard treatment when the tumour is located. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are palliative treatments, but has not shown to be very effective.
