A case of gastric adenocarcinoma presenting as portal hypertension. Portal vein thrombus has been detected in patients with liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, ulcerative colitis, septicemia, myeloproliferative disorder, and neoplasm. The formation of portal tumor thrombus by hepatocellular carcinoma is well recognized, because of its high incidence, and subsequent development of portal hypertension such as rupture of varices, ascites and liver failure indicates the poor prognosis. In gastric cancer, portal hypertension as an initial presentation is extremely rare. Herein we report a case presenting as portal hypertension caused by tumor thrombus without invasion of liver parenchyma. It is presumed to be intraluminal tumor thrombus originating from primary foci of gastric adenocarcinoma. Tumor thrombus in the portal vein is demonstrated on the PET-CT.
