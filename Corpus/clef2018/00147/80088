Risks in amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects. In 139 patients for prenatal diagnosis 186 amniocenteses were required. The repetiion of amniocentesis followed in 12.3% due to failure of cell growth, in 1.1% due to failure to obtain fluid, and in 10.2% to performe the fetography. In 3 pregnant women 2 repetitions were indicated. Although the amniocentesis were performed without ultrasound, in 92% the first insertion of needle were already succeeded in obtaining fluid. In repeated amniocenteses no significant differences were found. Brownish fluid were observed in 4.7% of the first amniocentesis. With 24.4% it was significantly more frequent in the repeated amniocenteses. Bloody taps appeared in each fifth puncture, but only in 2.8% blood fluid were also withdrawed for cell culture. 82.9% of the first amniocentesis followed between 16 and 19 week's gestational age and the result was present after 20.3 days on an average. The abortion rate was 4.3%. Among the newborns one hydrocephalus with questionable needle mark, one microcephalus and one further child with questionable needle mark were found. In one duodenal atresia and in one achondroplasia an inconclusive result was obtained. Two erroneous diagnoses of sex occurred and no diagnosis was obtained in two women.
