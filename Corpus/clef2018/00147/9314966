Hepatic tumor invasion of bile ducts: wedge-shaped sign on MR images. To clarify the diagnostic importance of wedge-shaped areas of increased signal intensity that surround liver tumors on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images.In five patients with hepatic tumors, T1-weighted MR images that demonstrated wedge-shaped areas of increased signal intensity in the liver were reviewed findings were compared with those at surgical and histologic examinations.MR images showed localized intrahepatic bile duct dilatation lateral (three patients) and medial (two patients) to liver tumors within the wedge-shaped areas. At histopathologic examination, intraductal tumor growth was seen in local bile ducts in the same areas in five patients, and lipofuscin deposits were seen in the cytoplasm of atrophic hepatocytes in three patients.On T1-weighted images, wedge-shaped areas of increased signal intensity associated with liver tumors indicate intraductal tumor extension in intrahepatic bile ducts. T1 shortening is possibly caused by lipofuscin deposits in atrophic hepatocytes.
