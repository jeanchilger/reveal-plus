Late recurrence after resection of mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: report of a case. The outcome after surgical resection for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has not been satisfactorily evaluated due to its malignant behavior. Surgical resection, however, has the potential to improve the prognosis and may allow surgeons to experience rare cases with long survival. This report presents the case of a patient who developed recurrence 9 years after resection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. A 76-year-old female was diagnosed to have intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and underwent an extended right posterior subsegmentectomy. The gross appearance showed a mass-forming type tumor. The histopathological examination revealed well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with portal vein invasion. Subcutaneous metastasis in the head as the first sign of relapse was diagnosed 9 years after hepatectomy. The histopathological findings of the subcutaneous tumor were similar to those of the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, thus suggesting metastasis from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Positron emission tomography with 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose was useful for detecting multiple metastases. Long-term follow-up for more than 5 years is recommended because the present case shows that late recurrence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma occurs even 5 years after resection.
