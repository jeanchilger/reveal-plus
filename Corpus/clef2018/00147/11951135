The value of magnetic resonance cholangiography for the expedient diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. Management of symptomatic cholecystolithiasis is vitally influenced by dilated biliary tract and choledocholithiasis. The objectives of this prospective pilot study were to evaluate the diagnostic value of preoperative magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) compared to diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and to establish an efficient algorithm for diagnostics and treatment of choledocholithiasis.All consecutive patients with cholecystolithiasis and dilated biliary tract proven by sonography as well as elevated liver function tests were enrolled within 12 months. Patients without evidence of bile duct calculi underwent preoperative MRC, whereas patients with choledocholithiasis immediate ERC.58 patients (30 male, 28 female) with a median age of 59.4 years underwent preoperative MRC. In 18 patients (10 male, 8 female median age 63.5 years) with evidence of choledocholithiasis we subsequently performed ERC and papillotomy. Bile duct stones were detected and removed after papillotomy in 10 patients, whereas calculi could not be found anymore in 8 patients. The remaining 40 patients without calculi evident on MRC were transferred to magnetic resonance tomography and ERC in case of suspected malignancy or to cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiography (IOC), which could definitely exclude choledocholithiasis. In comparison to ERC respectively IOC, MRC was able to detect bile duct stones with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 83.3%.Non-invasive MRC seems to replace diagnostic ERC concerning the presence of choledocholithiasis in case of cholecystolithiasis and dilated biliary tract with a high sensitivity. The preoperative ERC with stone extraction is still the therapy of choice in case of radiologically confirmed choledocholithiasis.
