Presurgical planning for hepatobiliary malignancies: clinical and imaging considerations. There are many considerations in the evaluation of liver malignancy before planned surgical treatment. This article focuses on interpretation of MR imaging of the liver for surgical treatment planning of hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer metastases, and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Clinical status, anatomic variants, future liver remnant, and underlying liver disease are all important factors in the decision to proceed with liver resection. The primary objective of preoperative imaging is to correctly identify patients who are candidates for curative intervention and to accurately stage their disease. Treatment planning for these complex patients is best done with a multidisciplinary team approach.
