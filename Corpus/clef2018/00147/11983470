Diagnosis and staging of gallbladder carcinoma. Evaluation with dynamic MR imaging. The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis and staging of gallbladder cancer (GBC). Images of dynamic MRI of hepatobiliary system combined with MR cholangiography (MRC) of 18 patients with pathologically proved gallbladder cancer were correlated with pathological and operative findings. Focal or diffuse wall thickening was present in 10 patients. In five patients, the tumor appeared as a fungating or intramural mass. A tumor replacing the gallbladder was found in two patients and a small cancer in cystic duct in one patient. The tumor featured early and irregular enhancement, which persisted throughout the dynamic study. Metastatic nodes were found by surgicopathology in 13 patients and were depicted by the dynamic MRI in 11 patients. Local invasion to liver was found by surgery in 12 patients and correctly detected by MRI in 11 patients. MRI detected duodenum invasion in three out of six patients and none of the three cases with omental metastasis. In conclusion, dynamic MRI is useful and reliable in staging of advanced gallbladder cancer. MRI combined with MRC is sensitive in detection of obstructive jaundice, liver invasion as well as liver and lymph nodes metastasis. It is more difficult to delineate the invasion to duodenum and omental metastasis by MRI.
