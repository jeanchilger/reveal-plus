PPAR-gamma expression in peritoneal endometriotic lesions correlates with pain experienced by patients. Endometriosis is a significant gynecologic condition that can cause both pain and infertility and affects up to 15% of women during their reproductive years. In peritoneal endometriotic lesions, the expression of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor gamma, a nuclear receptor with antiinflammatory and neuroprotective roles, is positively correlated with the pain reported by patients.
