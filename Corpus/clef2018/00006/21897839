The microRNA-200 family is upregulated in endometrial carcinoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MicroRNAs are dysregulated in cancer and may play essential roles in tumorigenesis. Additionally, miRNAs have been shown to have prognostic and diagnostic value in certain types of cancer. The objective of this study was to identify dysregulated miRNAs in endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (EEC) and the precursor lesion, complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH).We compared the expression profiles of 723 human miRNAs from 14 cases of EEC, 10 cases of CAH, and 10 normal proliferative endometria controls using Agilent Human miRNA arrays following RNA extraction from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. The expression of 4 dysregulated miRNAs was validated using real time reverse transcription-PCR.Forty-three miRNAs were dysregulated in EEC and CAH compared to normal controls (p<0.05). The entire miR-200 family (miR-200a/b/c, miR-141, and miR-429) was up-regulated in cases of EEC.This information contributes to the candidate miRNA expression profile that has been generated for EEC and shows that certain miRNAs are dysregulated in the precursor lesion, CAH. These miRNAs in particular may play important roles in tumorigenesis. Examination of miRNAs that are consistently dysregulated in various studies of EEC, like the miR-200 family, will aid in the understanding of the role that miRNAs play in tumorigenesis in this tumour type.
