Regenerating nodules in arteriohepatic syndrome: a case report. We report the multimodality imaging features of two cases of arteriohepatic syndrome (AS) complicated by a regenerating nodule. CT, ultrasound and MRI revealed nodular liver lesions with cirrhotic and portal hypertension changes. A large mass identified in both cases appeared hyperdense on unenhanced CT, hypointense on T(2) weighted imaging and showed normal-appearing hepatic vasculature coursing through the lesion in all contrast-enhanced imaging, highly suggestive of a regenerating nodule. Knowledge of this entity is quite important as patients with AS are also predisposed to hepatocellular carcinoma.
