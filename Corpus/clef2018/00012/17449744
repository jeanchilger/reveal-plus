Focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules in alcoholic liver cirrhosis: radiologic-pathologic correlation. The purpose of this study was to describe our experience with three patients who had pathologically proven focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)-like nodules that radiologically mimicked hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).FNH-like nodules may radiologically mimic HCC, appearing as hypervascular masses on contrast-enhanced CT images and as high-signal-intensity masses on superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MR images. Pathologically, there is the presence of a high number of unpaired arteries and sinusoidal capillarization, which may mimic HCC. Thus, it is important to differentiate FNH-like nodules radiologically, pathologically, and clinically from HCC.
