Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis following accidental dural puncture and epidural blood patch. We report the case of a woman who developed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after an attempted epidural. The epidural was complicated by an accidental dural puncture and the ensuing headache was initially treated with an epidural blood patch. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is an uncommon condition with varying aetiology and risk factors. We discuss the importance of the differential diagnosis for postpartum headache and explore the relationship between cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and the triad of pregnancy, dural puncture and epidural blood patch.
