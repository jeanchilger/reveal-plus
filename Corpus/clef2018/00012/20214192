Management of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignant tumors worldwide and its incidence has increased over the last years in most developed countries. The majority of HCCs occur in the context of liver cirrhosis. Therefore, patients with cirrhosis and those with hepatitis B virus infection should enter a surveillance program. Detection of a focal liver lesion by ultrasound should be followed by further investigations to confirm the diagnosis and to permit staging. A number of curative and palliative treatment options are available today. The choice of treatment will depend on the tumor stage, liver function and the presence of portal hypertension as well as the general condition of the patient. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to offer to each patient the best treatment.
