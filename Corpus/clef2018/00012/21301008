Liver transplantation: A new risk factor for intestinal intussusceptions. Intestinal intussusception in adults is associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, abdominal tumors or previous abdominal surgery but most often of unknown origin.The aim of our study was to evaluate circumstances and identify risk factors for intussusceptions.All 65,928 abdominal ultrasound examinations performed at our tertiary medical center between January 2001 and June 2008 were analyzed retrospectively for the diagnosis "intussusception". After identifying individuals with sonographically proven intussusception we analyzed various patients' characteristics including age, gender and underlying disease as well as sonographic findings such as localization of the intussusception, absence or presence of ascites and lymph nodes.We identified 32 cases of intussusceptions [mean age 45 years (range 18 to 88) 18 patients were male]. Twelve patients (38%) had a history of abdominal surgery including 8 patients who had undergone liver transplantation (2 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, 1 patient with cystic fibrosis, 1 patient with sarcoidosis, 1 patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and HCV infection, 1 patient with autoimmune hepatitis, 1 patient with Crigler-Najar-syndrome and one patient with echinococcus). A hepaticojejunostomy had been performed in 4 of the patients after liver transplantation. Liver transplanted patients were significantly overrepresented in the intussusceptions group compared with the overall cohort of patients undergoing abdominal ultrasound examination (25% vs. 8%, Chi-Square-test, p = 0.0023).In our retrospective study liver transplantation, in particular with hepaticojejunostomy, was identified as a new major risk factor for intestinal intussusceptions
