Value of high risk human papilloma virus detection in screening and diagnosing cervical lesion in littoral of Zhejiang province. To analyse the infection of high-risk human papiliomavirus (HR-HPV) in cervical lesion wome, and evaluate the significance of high-risk human pappilomavirus detection by hybrid capture II (HV-II) in screening and diagnosing cervical lesion, especially high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).A series of 1130 patients of cervical lesion were preliminarily diagnosed by cervical cytological examination, HR-HPV detection by HC-II , colposcopy and biopsy under the colposcopy between June 2009 and December 2008, including 212 CIN I and (or) condyloma (CIN I/HPV I), 442 CIN II/III, 28 invasive cervical cancer. cervical cytological examination is by thin prep liquid-based cytology test(TCT),and HR-HPV detection is by HC-II.In 1130 cases the positive of HR-HPV was 65.84% (744/1130). Unusual cytology result were 862 cases, with 356 ASCUS, 84 ASCH, 216 LSIL, 184HSIL and 22 cancer. The number of biopsy > or = CINI/HPVI was 682, positive rate of HR-HPV was 78.59% (536/682). In screening CIN II or above, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of TCT were 88.94%, 32.73%, 48.49%, 80.60%, of HR-HPV DNA detectiort by HC-II were 90.21%, 51.82%, 57.14%, 88.14%, and of HR-HPV detection combined with cytology were 97.45%, 22.42%, 47.22%, 92.50%.The infection rate of HR-HPV in cervical lesions is higher in each age group. Infection rate of HR-HPV is ascending with serious degree of cervical lesion. HR-HPV detection by HC- II is an important method in screening cervical lesion. HR-HPV detection is a viable option in the management of women with ASCUS and LSIL of TCT, with higher sensitivity and NPV.
