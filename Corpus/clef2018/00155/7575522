Differential expression of cytokine genes in cervical cancer tissues. The expression of genes coding for inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1-alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-6, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha from 15 normal cervix, 11 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 13 cervical cancer tissues was investigated. The cytokine messenger ribonucleic acids were reverse transcribed and amplified in the presence of biotinylated and dinitrophenylated primers. Amplified DNA was then captured onto streptavidin-coated microwell plate and quantitatively measured in a colorimetric reaction using ant-DNP antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase. There is no change of IL-1 alpha, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha gene expression in either cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer tissues. But the transcription of interferon-gamma gene is significantly reduced in both cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer tissue as compared to normal cervix. This study demonstrated that reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction coupling to colorimetric microwell plate assay is a sensitive and useful method to quantitate multiple cytokine gene expression. Our results also suggest that cervical epithelial cells are capable to express cytokines and that interferon-gamma may play a role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer since its reduced expression may influence inflammation and immunity of the cervical tissues.
