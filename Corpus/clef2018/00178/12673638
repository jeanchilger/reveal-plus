Fetoplacental discrepancy involving structural abnormalities of chromosome 8 detected by prenatal diagnosis. We describe the finding of three cell lines involving different structural abnormalities of chromosome 8 detected in a prenatal diagnosis. Chorionic villi sampling (CVS) was performed on a pregnant woman because of advanced maternal age. Semidirect cytogenetic analysis showed a mos46,XX,i(8q)/46,XX,del(8)(p11.2) karyotype, confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Amniocentesis was subsequently performed, and the karyotype obtained was 46,XX,dup(8)(p23p11.2). The pregnancy was terminated pathologic findings included clubfeet, clenched left hand, subcutaneous edema and bilateral hydrocephalus. Molecular studies using chromosome 8 microsatellites performed on parents' blood and fetal tissues revealed a maternal meiotic origin of the inv dup(8p) with deletion of the distal p23 region and duplication of the remaining 8p. We propose a model to explain the cytogenetic findings, which includes a first maternal meiotic error giving rise to a large dicentric isochromosome 8 present in the ovum, a second error in one of the first zygote divisions with misdivision of the dicentric 8 giving rise to a cell line with del(8p) confined to the trophoblast and another cell line with inv dup(8p) confined to the fetal tissue and a third error in the trophoblast giving rise to a further cell line with isochromosome 8q.
