Evaluation of four years of prenatal screening for aneuploidies in Hospital S. Francisco Xavier using the integrated test. We report an audit of our Prenatal Screening Programme for aneuploidies between March 2003 and August 2007. Overall detection and false positive rates were 86% and 3.6%, respectively. These results are similar to those predicted by the Serum, Urine and Ultrasound Screening Study (SURUSS).
