Value of serial sonography in the in utero detection of duodenal atresia. Duodenal atresia can be fatal unless promptly diagnosed and treated surgically. Death occurs in the newborn secondary to emesis, aspiration, and electrolyte imbalance. Serial ultrasound scans were obtained for 2 patients, but duodenal atresia was not detected until 29 and 32 weeks' gestation, respectively. With prior knowledge of an infant with Down syndrome and duodenal atresia, management of fetal distress with subsequent operative delivery can be altered. Early prenatal diagnosis by ultrasonography and subsequent amniocentesis plays an important role in the antenatal and postpartum counseling and management of these patients and neonates.
