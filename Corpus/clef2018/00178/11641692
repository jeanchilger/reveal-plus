Prenatal diagnosis from cystic hygroma fluid: the value of fluorescence in situ hybridization. We sought to determine the optimal approach to the prenatal chromosome analysis of cystic hygroma fluid using traditional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization.A retrospective evaluation of our experience with traditional cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis on cystic hygroma fluid was performed through a systematic review of the Genzyme Genetics database from January 1995 to July 2000. Information on gestational age, sample volume, clinical ultrasound findings (including fetal viability), cytogenetic results, fluorescence in situ hybridization results, and turn-around-time were queried.Eighty-three specimens were included in the investigation. The mean gestational age was 18.1 weeks (range, 13-27 weeks), and the mean sample volume was 20.7 mL (range, 0.1-101 mL). Of the 72 samples in which > 5 mL of cystic hygroma fluid was available, the success rate for cytogenetic analysis was 76% (55/72 samples). In 11 specimens of < or = 5 mL of cystic hygroma fluid, cytogenetic analysis was successful in only 1 case (9%). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was attempted on 23 samples, 18 of which were successful (78%), including 6 of 9 cases of cell culture failure (67%). Both traditional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed in 21 instances when a sample of > 5 mL was available. A successful result was obtained by either cytogenetic testing or fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis or both in 19 of 21 of these cases (90%). Samples of > 5 mL from viable fetuses had a higher cytogenetic success rate (80%) and fluorescence in situ hybridization success rate (89%) than samples from fetuses with intrauterine death (38% and 50% cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization success rates, respectively.) The mean turn-around time was 8.2 days (range, 4-17 days). Results were available in < or = 12 days in 91% of cases. There was a 91% aneuploidy rate identified, with 45,X occurring in 86% of the samples.We conclude that the optimal approach for the prenatal diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities from cystic hygroma samples is to perform both traditional cytogenetic studies and interphase prenatal fluorescence in situ hybridization evaluation for the most common aneuploidies that involve chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y. With this combined approach, our data indicate that, in viable pregnancies with a fluid sample of >5 mL, a 90% diagnostic success rate can be achieved.
