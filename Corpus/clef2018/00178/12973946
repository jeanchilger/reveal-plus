Detection of embryo sex chromosome by dual color fluorescent in-situ hybridization. In order to evaluate the effects of sex chromosomal mosaicism on the accuracy of single-cell gender diagnosis, sex chromosomes of 21 normal fertilized embryos were detected by dual color fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). The results showed that 4 embryos had sex chromosomal mosaicism (19%) and the remaining 17 showed uniformly XX or XY signals in all blastomeres. In conclusion, identification of sex by dual color FISH analysis of a single cell was accurate and efficient, and sex chromosomal mosaicism would not affect preimplantation gender diagnosis.
