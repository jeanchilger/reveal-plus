Double aneuploidy in spontaneous miscarriages: two case reports and review of the literature. The occurrence of double aneuploidy is a relatively rare phenomenon. The clinical presentations are variable depending on the predominating aneuploidy or a combination effect of both. We report the cytogenetic data on products of conception from miscarriages over a period of 5 years. A total of 403 miscarriages were karyotyped and the tissues were villi in all cases. Of 403 cases, 54 cases with single aneuploidy and 2 cases of first-trimester miscarriages with double trisomies were found. These 2 cases with the karyotypes of 48,XXY,+15 and 48,XX,+5,+7 were cited for the first time in this study.
