Fetal gender impact on multiple-marker screening results. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and unconjugated estriol (uE3) are used in combination with maternal age to calculate the risk for Down syndrome (DS) in pregnancy. Increased levels of hCG and decreased levels of MSAFP and uE3 are consistent with an increased risk for DS. We retrospectively evaluated second-trimester maternal serum marker levels in a large cohort of patients with known normal outcomes and documented fetal gender. These included 15,428 patients who had MSAFP measurements, 11,428 patients with both MSAFP and hCG, and 6,090 patients with all three markers including uE3. MSAFP levels in patients with female fetuses were consistently lower than those with males. Conversely, hCG was higher in pregnancies with females as compared to males. No gender-related difference was noted for uE3. These results would suggest that the computed DS risk for female fetuses is higher than for males, despite the fact that the incidence of DS is similar in both genders. This information could be useful for calculating gender-specific DS risk however, this would require ultrasonographic determination of fetal sex.
