Incidence of fetal chromosome abnormalities in 2264 low-risk women. Among a population of 6305 pregnant women, aged 25 to 34 years and estimated to be at no increased risk of genetic disease in the fetus, 4606 women participated in a randomized controlled trial of genetic amniocentesis between 1980 and 1984. In the study group having amniocentesis (2264 women), 23 fetal chromosome abnormalities (1.0 per cent) were found: eight autosomal aneuploidies, seven sex chromosome aneuploidies, seven balanced structural rearrangements and one case of a marker chromosome. The structural rearrangements and the marker chromosome were all shown to be inherited. The study group seemed representative for the whole population of younger women at low genetic risk. Therefore, a 1.0 per cent total rate of fetal chromosome abnormalities, consisting of one-third autosomal aneuploidies, one-third sex chromosome aneuploidies and one-third structural rearrangements, may be expected in the second trimester in younger low-risk women. In the same period of time, 562 women in the same age group were offered amniocentesis because of an estimated increased risk of fetal genetic disease. The total rate of fetal chromosome abnormality in this 'high-risk' group was 0.9 per cent and thus no different from the rate in the low-risk group.
