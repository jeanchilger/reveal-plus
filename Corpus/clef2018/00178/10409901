Is sterility a genetic burden?. Genetic causes of infertility are probably not rare. Today only a fraction of genes directly or indirectly involved in reproduction including sex determination and differentiation are known. Nevertheless, the list of well-defined genetic disorders impairing fertility is impressing already today and growing rapidly. Gonosomal aneuploidy and structural rearrangements represent a significant portion of the genetic causes of infertility in both sexes. Other chromosomal conditions include autosomal balanced structural changes (e.g. translocations), probably due to pairing disturbances of the affected chromosomes during meiosis. Some fundamental mechanisms in sex determination and differentiation have been characterized in recent years. Mutations in some of the genes involved in this process may lead to familial infertility. Genetic defects in gametogenesis of both sexes are currently being investigated using mouse models. Male specific causes of infertility include microdeletion within the AZF region of the euchromatic part of the long arm of the Y chromosome and obstructive azoospermia due congenital aplasia of the vas deferens in the presence of mutations in the CFTR gene.
