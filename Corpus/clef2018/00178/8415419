The diagnostic potential of fetal renal biopsy. The feasibility of fetal renal biopsy has been investigated in order to assess the diagnostic value of the histological specimen. Two fetuses with a severe bilateral renal abnormality (multicystic dysplastic kidney, Meckel-Gruber syndrome with polycystic kidney) and one fetus with Down syndrome (no detectable structural anomaly) were sampled. Histological findings in the biopsy specimens of cases 1 and 2 were diagnostic of an early obstructive renal disease. In case 3, the findings were consistent with normal development for gestational age of the kidney. Fetal renal biopsy is technically feasible histological examination of the samples showed a good correlation with postnatal findings. Further studies of its diagnostic value are required.
