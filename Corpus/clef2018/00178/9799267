Embryonic lethality and tumorigenesis caused by segmental aneuploidy on mouse chromosome 11. Chromosome engineering in mice enables the construction of models of human chromosomal diseases and provides key reagents for genetic studies. To begin to define functional information for a small portion of chromosome 11, deficiencies, duplications, and inversions were constructed in embryonic stem cells with sizes ranging from 1 Mb to 22 cM. Two deficiencies and three duplications were established in the mouse germline. Mice with a 1-Mb duplication developed corneal hyperplasia and thymic tumors, while two different 3- to 4-cM deficiencies were embryonically lethal in heterozygous mice. A duplication corresponding to one of these two deficiencies was able to rescue its haplolethality.
