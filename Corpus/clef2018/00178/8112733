Maternal cell contamination in amniotic fluid samples as a consequence of the sampling technique. Maternal cell contamination in amniotic fluid samples is easily detected by in situ hybridization if the karyotype of the fetus differs from the karyotype of the mother. One out of two amniotic fluid samples appears to contain more than 20% maternal cells. Bloody samples often contain even more than 50% maternal cells. Maternal cells can also be identified on the basis of their nuclear morphology. Maternal cell contamination is regularly observed in pregnancies with an anterior placenta, whereas it is rare in posterior placenta pregnancies. The maternal cells are therefore thought to be artificially introduced into the amniotic fluid sample, as a result of placental bleeding during amniocentesis. The implications of maternal cell contamination for prenatal diagnosis using uncultured amniotic fluid samples are discussed.
