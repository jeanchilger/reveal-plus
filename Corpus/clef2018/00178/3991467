Further examples of trisomy-20 mosaicism in amniotic cell cultures. Amniotic fluid cultures from two patients showed trisomy-20 mosaicism. No trisomy-20 cells were found in a normal full term infant and in multiple tissue biopsies and fetal blood from a fetus after a termination of pregnancy. No definitive advice is yet possible for parents where trisomy-20 amniotic cell mosaicism is detected. Fetoscopy and fetal blood sampling are of no value and termination of pregnancy is not indicated by empirical evidence. Preferential trophoblastic non-disjunction (Kalousek and Dill, 1983) is discussed as a possible partial explanation for the variable occurrence and distribution of this type of mosaicism.
