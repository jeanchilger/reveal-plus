A 5-year review of prenatal diagnosis in Graz (author's transl). Between 1/7/1974 and 30/6/1979 we analysed 532 amniotic fluid cell cultures. In 402 cases a genetic indication for amniocentesis was given 57 prenatal diagnoses were carried out for gynaecological and other medical indications. We also analysed 73 amniotic fluid test samples. Altogether 19 pathological results (3.6%) were found. We observed 16 abnormal findings in 459 diagnostic amniocenteses and 3 pathological results in the test cultures. The transmission of parental chromosomal polymorphisms to the fetus is discussed here. The importance of prenatal diagnosis in genetic counselling, along with cost-benefit reflections, are stressed in this paper.
