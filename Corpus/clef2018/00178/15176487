Derangement of hypothetical proteins in fetal Down's syndrome brain. The success of the Human Genome Project (HGP) enables prediction of proteins by computer programs from nucleic acid sequences and for which there is no experimental evidence. Clues for function of hypothetical proteins are provided by sequence similarity with proteins of known function in model organisms. The availability of this bulk of new data is of immediate importance to Down's syndrome (DS) research. DS is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and is characterized by somatic anomalies and mental retardation. In addition, overexpression of chromosome 21 genes is directly or indirectly responsible for mental retardation and other phenotypic abnormalities of DS. To allow insight into how trisomy 21 represents the phenotype of DS, we constructed a two-dimensional protein map and investigated expression of 8 hypothetical proteins in fetal DS (n = 7) and control (n = 7) brains (cortex). Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) with subsequent in-gel digestion of spots and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) spectroscopic identification followed by quantification of spots with specific software was applied. Quantitative analysis of hypothetical protein FLJ10849, hypothetical protein FLJ20113, and activator of hsp90 ATPase homologue 1 (AHA1) revealed levels comparable between DS and controls. By contrast, expression levels of hypothetical protein KIAA1185, hypothetical protein 55.2 kDa, hypothetical protein 58.8 kDa, actin-related protein 3beta (ARP3beta), and putative GTP-binding protein PTD004 were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in fetal DS brain, and domain analysis suggests involvement in cytoskeleton, signaling, and chaperone system abnormalities.
