Thoughts about screening for Down syndrome. The more important clinical manifestations and the opportunities of screening for Down syndrome are briefly summarized in this paper. The methods used for screening (biochemical markers, fetal ultrasound signs) and the most important screening tests (combined screening, integrated screening) are described. Then, the author analyses the situation of screening in Hungary, and he emphasizes that maternal age over 35 years, and low serum level of alpha-fetoprotein cannot be the only indication for amniocentesis. The first aim should be to increase the detection rate of disease diagnostics and to decrease the number of amniocenteses. Currently, the most effective screening method is the combined test in the first trimester. The nationwide introduction of this method requires the improvement of personal and material environment of ultrasound diagnostics and the corresponding financial background.
