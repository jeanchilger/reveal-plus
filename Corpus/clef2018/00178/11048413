Screening for Down's syndrome in the 10th to 13th week of pregnancy. The implementation of antenatal screening for Down's syndrome at 10-13. week using nuchal translucency, maternal serum free subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin and the mother's age.Nuchal translucency scan (NT) and serum free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin subunit (FB hCG) were measured at 283 consecutive pregnant women booked at the same antenatal care facility between 10-13. gestational week.Antenatal screening center Klimentska, Prague.Medians of both markers according to gestational age as well as retrospective combined risk of Down's syndrome were assessed.95 per cent of NT measurements was below 1.77 multiples of median. 95 per cent of FB hCG measurements was below 1.88 multiples of median. Combined risk higher than 1/300 had 1 per cent mothers (total 3 screen positive results).The results of this pilot study serve for implementation of screening for Down's syndrome at 10-13. week as well as for integration of both first and second trimester screening systems.
