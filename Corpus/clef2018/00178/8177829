Abnormal amniotic fluid levels of CA 125 in second-trimester Down syndrome pregnancies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentration of CA 125 in second trimester amniotic fluid from Down syndrome pregnancies. CA 125 was measured in stored amniotic fluid samples from pregnancies of 14-19 weeks' gestation with and without Down syndrome fetuses. CA 125 levels were expressed in multiples of the median (MOM) for normal pregnancies of the same gestational age. Twenty-one pregnancies with Down syndrome fetuses and 63 unaffected controls matched for maternal age, gestational age, and duration of storage were studied. The median MOM values of the affected pregnancies were significantly higher than those of the controls (1.41 MOM versus 0.99 MOM). These findings show that there is an increased concentration of CA 125 in second-trimester amniotic fluid from Down syndrome pregnancies.
