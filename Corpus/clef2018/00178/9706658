A near false-negative finding of mosaic trisomy 21--a cautionary tale. We report the finding of a mosaic trisomy 21 restricted to the long-term culture of chorionic villi and to one amniotic fluid culture which, if interpreted according to the standard rules for the authentication of mosaicism, would have resulted in a false-negative result. The definitive diagnosis of mosaic Down syndrome was eventually confirmed by cordocentesis and by post-abortion fibroblast cultures.
