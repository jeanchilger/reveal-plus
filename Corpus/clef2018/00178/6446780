Down syndrome, water fluoridation, and maternal age. It has been claimed that there is a positive association between the frequency of Down syndrome and the fluoridation of drinking water. It has also been suggested that this association is most pronounced in young women. Recent congenital malformations data obtained from birth certificates from large U.S. cities have been analyzed. Some cities had fluoridated water supplies, while others had supplies deficient in fluoride. The rates of Down syndrome in the cities with fluoridated and in those with non-fluoridated water supplies were comparable. In addition, there was no indication of any maternal age-specific association.
