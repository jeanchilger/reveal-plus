Preliminary data on an association between blood groups and serum markers used for the so-called "triple screening": free oestriol MoM values are decreased in rhesus-negative (Rh-) women. The serum markers human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and unconjugated oestriol (uE3) in 606 rhesus-negative (Rh-) women have been compared with 18 960 controls. There were no significant differences in the distribution of hCG and AFP between these two cohorts. However the uE3 values in Rh- women were significantly lowered (median: 0.85 MoM).
