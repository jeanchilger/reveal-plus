Relationship between nuchal translucency at 11-14 weeks and nuchal fold at 20-24 weeks of gestation. To examine the relationship between the measurement of nuchal translucency in the first trimester and nuchal fold in the second trimester in normal pregnancy.This was a prospective study of 592 singleton pregnancies. Fetal nuchal translucency was measured at 11-14 weeks of gestation and nuchal fold at 20-24 weeks of gestation. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between nuchal translucency and nuchal fold after adjustment for gestational age.There was no significant association between nuchal translucency and nuchal fold thickness.It is possible that measurement of nuchal translucency and nuchal fold may provide an independent contribution in screening for trisomy 21.
