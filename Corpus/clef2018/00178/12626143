Chromosomal abnormalities in a series of 6,733 human oocytes in preimplantation diagnosis for age-related aneuploidies. Most chromosomal abnormalities originate from female meiosis and contribute significantly to pregnancy failures, particularly in women of advanced maternal age. A total of 8,382 oocytes were obtained in 1,297 IVF cycles from patients of advanced maternal age (mean 38.5 years). Following a standard IVF protocol, oocytes were tested following removal and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the first (PB1) and second polar bodies (PB2), using probes specific for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21 and 22 (Vysis). FISH results were available in 67,33 (80.3%) oocytes tested, 3,509 (52.1%) of which were aneuploid, with the remaining 3,224 (47.9%) normal oocytes available for transfer. In all, 41.7% of oocytes had meiosis I errors, compared to 35.1% with meiosis II errors. Abnormalities in meiosis I were represented by extra chromatids in 15.4%, missing chromatids in 48.1%, missing chromosomes in 5.9%, extra chromosomes in 0.5%, and complex abnormalities in 30.1%. The proportions of abnormal oocytes with missing or extra chromatids in meiosis II were 36.6 and 41.2% respectively, with the remaining oocytes having complex abnormalities, involving missing or extra chromatids of different chromosomes (22.1%) following meiosis II. Overall, 41.8% oocytes had meiosis I, 30.7% meiosis II, and 27.6% both meiotic division errors. A total of 45.1% of the abnormal oocytes had complex errors, involving the same chromosome in both meiotic divisions (21.5%), or different chromosomes (78.5%), of which 74.8% were with abnormalities of two, and 25.2% with abnormalities of three chromosomes studied. Of 3,224 detected aneuploidy-free zygotes, 2,587 were transferred in 1,100 treatment cycles (2.35 embryos per transfer), resulting in 241 (21.9%) clinical pregnancies and 176 healthy children born, suggesting a positive clinical outcome following aneuploidy testing of oocytes in a group of IVF patients of average age 38.5 years.
