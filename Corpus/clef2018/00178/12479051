Chromosomal analysis of human sperm using multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization. Now severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermic (OAT) patients could have offsprings because of the development of technique of intracytoplasmic sperm injection. But some researchers found these patients have increasing frequency of the aneuploid on the chromosome in their sperm. If the spermatozoa with chromosomal aneuploid were fertilized, it would be resulted in a higher rate of recurrent abortion, fetal abnormal and dead birth, so the analysis of the number of sperm chromosome will play an important role in detection on infertile men. There are many new development in the chromosomal analysis of human sperm using multi-FISH, now we have a review on them.
