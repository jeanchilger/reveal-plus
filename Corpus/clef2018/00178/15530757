Increasing screening uptake amongst those intending to be screened: the use of action plans. This experimental study investigates an intervention designed to increase rates of antenatal screening uptake in those intending to undergo antenatal screening. Eighty-eight pregnant women intending to undergo prenatal screening were alternately allocated to standard care or asked to write a simple plan for attending or making an appointment. Twenty-five (63%) in the intervention group made an action plan. There was no difference in uptake of screening between the intervention group and the control group, nor between those making an action plan and the control group. Within the intervention group, those making an action plan had higher screening uptake (21/25, 84%) than those not making one (7/15, 47% CI(95) difference = 8-66%, P = 0.017). Asking women who intend to undergo screening to make an action plan does not increase screening uptake. This result raises doubts about introducing simple action plans in a clinical situation as an effective means of changing behaviour.
