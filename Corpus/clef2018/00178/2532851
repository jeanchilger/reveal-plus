Congenital anomalies in twins in Northern Ireland. I: Anomalies in general and specific anomalies other than neural tube defects and of the cardiovascular system, 1974-1979. Data are presented from a large-scale population-based study in Northern Ireland, in which multiple sources of ascertainment were used. As found in other studies, the overall prevalence at birth of congenital anomalies amongst twins (285.4/10,000) was somewhat higher than the rate amongst singletons (241.8/10,000). Unlike in other studies, however, the rate amongst twins of like sex (287.8/10,000) was not markedly higher than that amongst twins of unlike sex (252.3/10,000). Problems of comparison between series are discussed.
