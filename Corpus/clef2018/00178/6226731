The placenta in trisomy in the last trimester of pregnancy. 18 cases of trisomies 13, 18, or 21 were diagnosed either by examining the caryotype or on clinical criteria. When the placenta was examined in 60% of cases there was a marked retardation of villous maturation with frequent persistence of embryonic forms of villi. The authors suggest that the failure of the villi to mature was often a reflection of pathology in the oocyte which started to show itself at the beginning of the pregnancy.
