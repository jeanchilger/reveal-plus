Complete discrepancy between abnormal fetal karyotypes predicted by QF-PCR rapid testing and karyotyped cultured cells in a first-trimester CVS. A chorion villus sample (CVS) biopsied at 11 weeks' gestation for raised nuchal translucency, revealed monosomy X (presumptive 45,X karyotype) by QF-PCR for rapid aneuploidy testing for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. Long-term culture gave the karyotype: 47,XY,+ 21[66]/49,XYY,+ 21,+ 21 [22]. This discrepancy prompted redigestion of the combined residual villus fragments from the original QF-PCR assay. The repeat QF-PCR assay identified the presence of trisomy 21 and a Y chromosome consistent with a 47,XY,+ 21 karyotype. A double non-disjunction event early in embryogenesis in a 47,XY,+ 21 conceptus with subsequent cell lineage compartmentalisation of the three observed cell lines (45,X 47,XY,+ 21 and 49,XYY,+ 21,+ 21) would account for these results. This is the first reported case to describe complete discrepancy at diagnosis between abnormal karyotypes detected by QF-PCR rapid aneuploidy testing and a cultured karyotype in the same CVS.
