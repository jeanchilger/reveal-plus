Low PAPP-A levels between 11 and 13(+6) weeks of gestation and the risk of preeclampsia. PAPP-A is one of the 2 biochemical markers of the first trimester Down syndrome serum screening. In Bulgaria this screening was first performed in 2006. The threshold values for evaluation of the risk of development of preeclampsia used by the researchers vary in a wide range. Nevertheless in the last several years the most used value is 0.4 MoM. The aim of represented study is evaluate the low PAPP-A levels as a marker for development of preeclampsia alone, or in combination with some risk factors. The data of 194 singleton pregnancies that underwent a first trimester Down syndrome screening between January 2008 and June 2009 had been analyzed. Twenty three patients (11.6%) developed preeclampsia, of which 8 required delivery before 34th gw. The control group includes 134 women who had term deliveries of healthy babies. Nine out of 23 (39%) patients with preeclampsia, 5 out of 8 (62.5%) patients with early onset preeclampsia and 42 out of 134 (30.4%) controls had PAPP-A levels below 0.4 MoM. These levels are associated with relative risk for development of preeclampsia of 1.5 times. Low PAPP-A levels in the first trimester were associated with a low prognostic value for development of preeclampsia and early preeclampsia before 34th gw. When low PAPP-A levels are added to the maternal age and especially results of Doppler evaluation of the uterine arteries significant prognostic value improvement was observed.
