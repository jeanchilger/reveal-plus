Evaluation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound examination to screen fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), anatomic anomalies and precocious defects of foetal growth were shown as possible "indicators" of foetal chromosomal pathology, in particular Down's syndrome, and thus suggested for prenatal screening of risk patients for this chromosomal abnormalities. The Authors carried out a retrospective study on 1472 patients who underwent amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis. Between the 15th and the 20th week, a dosage of MSAFP was effected, in order to evaluate if the serum concentration of this substance could predict Down's syndrome. A contemporary study by echographic monitoring was effected on 500 patients from the 1st trimester of pregnancy, in order to detect possible foetal growth retardation precociously and to determine the karyotype in these cases. Results are very interesting and suggest both the dosage of MSAFP and the ecographic monitoring for prenatal screening of trisomy 21, especially in maternal age classes younger than 40 years, where the cost/benefit ratio of screening for maternal age is less favourable.
