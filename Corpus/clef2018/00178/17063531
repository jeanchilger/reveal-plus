Rapid prenatal diagnosis of common trisomies: discordant results between QF-PCR analysis and karyotype analysis on long-term culture for a case of trisomy 18 detected in CVS. QF-PCR analysis can be used as a rapid test to diagnose primary trisomy in prenatal samples. Mosaicism in CVS detected by QF-PCR has previously been reported however, no case has so far been reported in which the QF-PCR result was completely discrepant to that of the karyotype analysis from a long-term culture.A CVS, referred because of a high serum screening risk of 1:10 for Down Syndrome and 1:110 for Edwards Syndrome, was tested by QF-PCR analysis and chromosome analysis of cultured cells. Subsequent analyses were carried out on a follow-up amniotic fluid sample and foetal tissue samples.Conflicting results were obtained between QF-PCR analysis on two independent fronds from the chorionic villi and chromosome analysis on cultured CVS. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis on a subsequent amniotic fluid sample indicated trisomy 18 with no evidence of mosaicism. Analysis of follow-up tissue confirmed trisomy in a foetal skin sample and mosaicism for trisomy 18 in four placental sites tested.We report here an apparently normal CVS QF-PCR result that was completely discrepant with the trisomy 18 positive karyotype result on long-term culture. This has important implications regarding our current testing protocol.
