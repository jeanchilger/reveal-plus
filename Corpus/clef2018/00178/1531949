Fetal growth in aneuploid conditions. Fetal growth failure is a significant clinical problem. Although aneuploid conditions account for only a few cases of intrauterine growth retardation, the clinical importance of these conditions is profound. Recognition of aneuploidy demands a high index of suspicion from the clinician and some knowledge of the growth patterns associated with these syndromes (Table 3). Symmetric growth retardation as a clinically recognizable entity probably does not exist. However, variations in the growth patterns in different aneuploidies may add important diagnostic clues to the evaluation of the growth-retarded fetus. In addition a better understanding of these patterns and their regulation may provide insight into the mechanisms, not only of abnormal, but perhaps more importantly, of normal fetal growth and development.
