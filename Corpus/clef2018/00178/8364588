Paternal mosaicism for a COL1A1 dominant mutation (alpha 1 Ser-415) causes recurrent osteogenesis imperfecta. We describe a dominant point mutation in the COL1A1 gene causing extremely severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI type II/III) which was detected in the dermal fibroblasts of a proband, diagnosed by ultrasonography at 24 weeks of gestation. Type I collagen secretion was reduced and pro alpha 1(I) chains were overmodified. The mutation was localised in one COL1A1 allele by chemical cleavage of mismatched bases in normal cDNA/proband's mRNA heteroduplexes, and identified by cloning and sequencing. A G-to-A transition which causes the substitution of Gly-415 with serine in the alpha 1(I) triple helical domain was found. The same mutation was detected in the father's spermatozoa and lymphocytes. Mosaicism in the father's germline explains the occurrence in the family of two additional OI pregnancies, which were documented by X-ray and ultrasound investigations.
