Transvaginal sonographic measurement of fetal lingual width in early pregnancy. Our objective was to construct a nomogram of the fetal lingual size early pregnancy and to assess the size of the tongue in abnormal fetuses. The lingual width was measured by using transvaginal ultrasonography in 80 normal fetuses at 13 and 18 weeks' gestation. In addition the tongue was measured in 22 fetuses at these gestational ages who had an abnormal karyotype or oro-facial malformations. A linear relationship was found between the lingual width and gestational age in normal fetuses. The lingual size was within the normal range in cases of trisomy 13, trisomy 21 and Turner syndrome. A small tongue was observed in fetuses with micrognathia. Correlation between lingual width and gestational age was observed in early pregnancy. The relationship between the size of the tongue and oro-facial malformation needs further evaluation.
