Distribution of extracellular matrix components in nuchal skin from fetuses carrying trisomy 18 and trisomy 21. We have investigated histologically the elevations of the skin in dorsal and lateral neck (nuchal) regions of human fetuses carrying karyotypes of trisomy 18 (Edwards' syndrome) and trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome). Cavities filled with interstitial fluid were found in the dermis, epidermal basement membrane and occasionally in the epidermis of trisomy-18 fetuses, but were not delineated by an epithelium or basement membrane as judged by the absence of immunostaining for laminin, collagen IV and collagen VII. Dilated vessels were also found at the interface between dermis and subcutis. Neither normal fetal skin nor that of trisomy-21 fetuses contained cavities or dilated vessels. In order to detect possible alterations of the extracellular matrix in trisomy-18 and trisomy-21 skin, the distribution of glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans was studied immunohistochemically. In trisomy-21 and control skin, the dermis stained intensely for fibronectin, whereas the subcutis reacted only weakly. In trisomy-18 skin, the stronger staining for fibronectin appeared in the subcutis, and the prevailing collagen type was collagen III, collagen type I being absent. In the skin of trisomy-21 fetuses, collagen VI was more irregularly arranged and densely packed, whereas collagen I was more widely spaced than in normal fetuses. More hyaluronan was present in the dermis and subcutis of trisomy-21 fetuses than in that of trisomy-18 and control fetuses. A correlation seems to exist between undelimited cavities and collagen III in trisomy-18 skin, and between hyaluronan and the specific arrangement of collagen in trisomy-21 skin.
