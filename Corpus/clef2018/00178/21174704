Diagnosis and treatment methods in recurrent miscarriage. Recurrent miscarriage is classically defined as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses. Established causes of recurrent miscarriage are antiphospholipid antibodies, uterine anomalies and abnormal chromosomes in either partner, particularly translocations. Embryonic aneuploidy is the most important cause of miscarriage before ten weeks' gestation. It can be speculated that about 51% of patients with a history of three miscarriages experienced these because of abnormal embryonic karyotypes. It is not necessary to give any medication for such cases caused by an abnormal embryonic karyotype. Psychological support might be the most important requirement to continue conceiving till live birth results.
