Alkaline phosphatase activity in amniotic fluid in pregnancies with fetal disorders. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined in 255 amniotic fluid samples collected by amniocentesis between 15 and 39 weeks of gestation. The samples were originally used for chromosomal analysis and/or alpha-fetoprotein measurements. The mean ALP activity in early amniotic fluid from pregnancies with fetal trisomy 18 and 21 syndromes was half of that found in the controls. Highly elevated ALP activity (over 10 times the median level) was found in 14 samples. Two of these pregnancies had normal outcome. Three samples were from pregnancies with intrauterine fetal death. Fetal disorders, including abdominal wall defect (four cases), Meckel's syndrome (two), hydrops fetalis syndrome (two) and genital anomaly (one), were observed in nine cases. Moderately elevated ALP activity (over three times the median) was found in 10 cases, including five pregnancies with a preterm labour shortly after the sample collection. The results indicate that elevated ALP activity in the third trimester amniotic fluid is often associated with fetal disorders.
