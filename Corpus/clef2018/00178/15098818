Preimplantation diagnosis (PGD)--a European clinician's point of view. This paper describes the current status of preimplantation diagnosis from the viewpoint of an experienced clinician specialized in reproductive medicine. Current progress and international experiences with different applications and techniques are being reviewed on the basis of the literature. Particular interest is focused on possible advantages of routinely diagnosing major chromosome aneuploidies in preimplantation-embryos of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. Last but not least, a short survey of the international guidelines and legislation is compared to the situation in the author's country, Austria, where it is currently unclear whether preimplantation diagnosis is allowed or not.
