Is routine AFP screening in pregnancy reassuring? The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of a negative result on a routine prenatal screening test, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening for spina bifida and Down's syndrome. Three-hundred and nine women had the test and 30 did not. Twenty-one of the 309 did not think that they had been tested, and seven women who did not have the test thought that they had been tested. There were no significant differences between these four groups in anxiety, certainty about the baby's health or worry about the baby's health. These results suggest that the receipt of a negative result on this screening test does not provide reassurance. There are several possible explanations for this finding: the test is reassuring, but only for a small number of those undergoing the test the test is reassuring but the study method was inappropriate and hence failed to detect it
