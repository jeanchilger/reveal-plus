Failure to document fetal cells in maternal circulation using the Selypes-Lorencz "air-culture" cytogenetic technique. Isolating and analyzing fetal cells circulating in the maternal circulation would allow a relatively noninvasive method (i.e., venipuncture) for prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis. Several groups have claimed evidence for the presence of fetal cells in maternal circulation, and in one communication, Selypes and Lorencz (1988) reported the presence of relatively large numbers of fetal mitotic cells in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated blood cultures derived from pregnant women. We employed the laboratory method of Selypes and Lorencz in evaluating maternal blood from 29 patients (9.7 to 19.5 weeks gestation) in which the fetal complement differed from that of the mother (e.g., 46,XY, aneuploidy). Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm the results of Selypes and Lorencz.
