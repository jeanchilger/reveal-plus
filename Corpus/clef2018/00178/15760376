Embryo aneuploidy screening for unexplained recurrent miscarriage: a minireview. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients and assess the role of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in preventing subsequent pregnancy loss and improving pregnancy outcome.Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis was performed in 241 RM cycles and in 35 cycles in patients undergoing PGD for sex-linked diseases (control group). Chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization.The implantation and pregnancy rates in RM patients were 26.4 and 36.5% versus 20.6 and 29.0% in the control group, respectively. The percentage of abnormal embryos was significantly increased in RM patients compared with controls.Recurrent miscarriage is associated with a higher incidence of chromosomally abnormal embryos. In vitro fertilization (IVF) plus PGD is an important step in the management of these couples.
