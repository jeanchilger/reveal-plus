Down syndrome at birth not detected by first-trimester chorionic villus sampling. A case of a false-negative first-trimester diagnosis following chorionic villus sampling is reported that ended with the birth of a child with Down syndrome. Chromosome analysis of 30 metaphases from 24 h-cultured chorionic villi obtained in week 12 of gestation showed a normal chromosome constitution. However, the newborn showed manifestations of Down syndrome, and 99 of 100 metaphases analysed from cultured lymphocytes showed 47, XY, + 21. The remaining metaphase was normal (46, XY).
