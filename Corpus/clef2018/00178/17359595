Extended embryo culture to increase implantation rate. Multiple pregnancies are a serious adverse event of IVF treatment. Several strategies have been developed to improve embryo selection and embryo developmental potential to increase pregnancy rates without increasing the risk of multiple pregnancies. The only way to effectively solve this problem is to reduce the number of embryos transferred to one. The introduction of extended embryo culture has provided IVF programmes with a valuable tool to select more accurately those embryos with a higher implantation potential. The concept of single embryo transfer presents a clinical dilemma with seemingly opposing sides: one seeking to maintain acceptable pregnancy rates and the other seeking to reduce the number of twin births or high order multiple pregnancies. The present review addresses the potential benefits and drawbacks of blastocyst transfer.
