Arguments for offering triple test serum screening for Down's syndrome to all pregnant women. In an advisory report to the Dutch Government, the Health Council of the Netherlands has recently recommended offering triple test serum screening for Down's syndrome to all pregnant women. According to a critical review in this journal, the Council should have proposed excluding those less than 30 years of age. However, there is no age at which a logical limit can be set. Moreover, to suggest that the negative aspects of the screening will prevail for those under a specific age, denies the women involved the right to make a judgment based on their own values and preferences. Secondly, although limited resources may be a reason for limiting access to screening, doing so would be a politico-ethical decision, which raises the issue of justice. Finally, there are reasons for thinking that a new age limit would complicate the necessary counselling as opposed to making it easier.
