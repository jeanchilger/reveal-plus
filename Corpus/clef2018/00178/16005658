Prognosis work-up in prenatal medicine: the example of Down's syndrome. Establishing a prognosis in prenatal medicine is often a complex and uncertain task. Predictive tools such as imagery techniques and biological markers may lack accuracy since they are used while the fetus is still pursuing its development. In France, antenatal euthanasia and fetal abandon are legal issues and socially accepted. Several non-medical factors may interfere with the final outcome such as the manner a condition is announced by the staff, the way it is experienced by the parents and the acceptance of the handicap within the society. We analysed the different medical and non medical factors intervening in the prognosis work up for Down's syndrome. Currently, the outcome of fetus with Down's syndrome is influenced by the orientation of our society that promotes screening tests and pregnancy interruptions instead of emphasizing on therapeutic research and improving their social integration.
