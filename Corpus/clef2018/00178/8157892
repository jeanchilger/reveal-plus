The value of early morphologic ultrasonography for the detection of chromosome anomalies. To demonstrate the benefit, in terms of improved antenatal screening, in particular for 21-trisomy, to be expected from the introduction of routine vaginal morphologic echography during the first trimester of pregnancy. This work was conducted by the Department of Gynaecology-Obstetrics of the French Red Cross Teaching Hospital in Bois-Guillaume, France.Over a 20 month period, 307 consultating women underwent routine endovaginal echography between the 10th and 13th week of amenorrhoea. The exploration was proposed to detect small retrocervical hydromas as a signal for further cytogenetic tests.Five hygromas were discovered and led to the diagnosis of 4 cases of 21-trisomy, the fifth pregnancy ended with spontaneous abortion. The 12th week appeared as the most favourable time for routine examination.This non-invasive method, routinely performed in all women, improves the yield of screening for 21-trisomy and allows a better means of indicating cytogenetic tests.
