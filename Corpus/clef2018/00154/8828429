Diagnostic performance of Hybrid Capture human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid assay combined with liquid-based cytologic study. Our purpose was to determine the diagnostic performance of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing when performed on liquid-based (Thin-prep) cytologic samples.Thin-prep cytologic study, human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid assay with probes for high oncogenic risk human papillomavirus types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 51, 52, and 56), and cervical biopsies on women referred to colposcopy for an abnormal Papanicolaou smear were performed.Of the 364 patients, 186 (51.6%) had a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse by histologic diagnosis. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid quantitation was correlated with a histologic diagnosis of squamous intraepithelial lesion (p < 0.0001) and the morphologic severity (p < 0.01). The combination of Thin-prep cytologic study and human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing correctly identified 87.7% of histologic low-grade lesions and 95.1% of the women with high grade lesions and invasive cancer (p < 0.01).A liquid-based cytologic system provides adequate material for concomitant human papillomavirus testing. Addition of human papillomavirus testing to Thin-prep cytologic study provides significant gains in diagnostic accuracy over either cytologic study or human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing alone.
