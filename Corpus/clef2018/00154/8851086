An autopsy case of traumatic sinus thrombosis. A 38-year-old male slipped accidentally and fell from a height of 4.6 m, and was admitted to a hospital. A radiograph indicated a linear fracture of the parietal bone across the sagittal sutura, and a computed tomography scan of the head showed severe subdural hematoma on both parietal sides, so an operation was performed to remove the hematoma. Five hours after the operation, brain death due to a cerebral herniation occurred, and he died six days later. Autopsy revealed a linear fracture of the parietal bones, which crossed obliquely the sagittal sutura. A slightly lacerated wound of the dura mater was seen on the sagittal sutura, from where the latter half of that point to the left and right transverse sinuses were occluded completely with thrombosis. The brain was markedly swollen. From these findings, the victim was considered to have died from acute cerebral swelling due to traumatic thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.
