Fatal course after osteosynthesis in a 18-year-old male. A previously healthy patient became comatose 8 h after osteosynthesis of a fractured femur and humerus. After an initially normal cranial computed tomography, extended lesions were found 10 h later in the control scan as an indication of an embolization in the basilar artery. After neurosurgeons assessed the situation to be unfavorable, no other interventions were conducted and 6 days later brain death was confirmed. During the subsequent heart transplantation the suspicion of a patent foramen ovale as the reason for the paradoxical cerebral embolization was confirmed. This tragic course raises the question whether a patent foramen ovale should be excluded or closed by interventional measures in similar situations.
