Monitoring of intracranial pressure in children. Prospective fiber optic study of an intraparenchymatous system. The authors studied the reliability and tolerance of a new intra-parenchymatous fiberoptic device for intracranial pressure monitoring in 20 neurosurgical children. The system proved to be reliable, and the measures were well correlated with clinical evolution, CT scan lesions, and the abolition of the cerebral perfusion pressure in the case of brain death. There was a minimal shift of the electric 0 after 15 days of monitoring. The tolerance was good and no hemorrhagic, infectious or epileptic complications were observed.
