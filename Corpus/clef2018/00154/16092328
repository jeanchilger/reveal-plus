A new path planning algorithm for maximizing visibility in computed tomography colonography. In virtual colonoscopy, minimizing the blind areas is important for accurate diagnosis of colonic polyps. Although useful for describing the shape of an object, the centerline is not always the optimal camera path for observing the object. Hence, conventional methods in which the centerline is directly used as a path produce considerable blind areas, especially in areas of high curvature. Our proposed algorithm first approximates the surface of the object by estimating the overall shape and cross-sectional thicknesses. View positions and their corresponding view directions are then jointly determined to enable us to maximally observe the approximated surface. Moreover, by adopting bidirectional navigations, we may reduce the blind area blocked by haustral folds. For comfortable navigation, we carefully smoothen the obtained path and minimize the amount of rotation between consecutive rendered images. For the evaluation, we quantified the overall observable area on the basis of the temporal visibility that reflects the minimum interpretation time of a human observer. The experimental results show that our algorithm improves visibility coverage and also significantly reduces the number of blind areas that have a clinically meaningful size. A sequence of rendered images shows that our algorithm can provide a sequence of centered and comfortable views of colonography.
