Transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration for treatment of tubo-ovarian abscess: a study of 302 cases. Our purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration together with antibiotic therapy for treatment of tubo-ovarian abscess.A review of women treated with transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration for tubo-ovarian abscess at Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway, between June 1986 and July 2003 was performed. Immediate clinical response and longer-term follow-up results were assessed.A total of 449 transvaginal aspirations were performed on 302 women. A total of 282 women (93.4%) were successfully treated for transvaginal aspiration of purulent fluid, together with antibiotic therapy. In the other 20 women (6.6%), surgery was performed. The main indications for surgery were diagnostic or therapeutic uncertainty, such as suspected residual tubo-ovarian abscess or pain. No procedure-related complications were diagnosed.Transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration combined with antibiotics is an effective and safe treatment regimen for tubo-ovarian abscess. The high success rate indicates that it should be a first-line procedure.
