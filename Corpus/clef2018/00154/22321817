LRRC3B gene is frequently epigenetically inactivated in several epithelial malignancies and inhibits cell growth and replication. Chromosome 3 specific NotI microarrays containing 180 NotI linking clones associated with 188 genes were hybridized to NotI representation probes prepared using matched tumor/normal samples from major epithelial cancers: breast (47 pairs), lung (40 pairs) cervical (43 pairs), kidney (34 pairs of clear cell renal cell carcinoma), colon (24 pairs), ovarian (25 pairs) and prostate (18 pairs). In all tested primary tumors (compared to normal controls) methylation and/or deletions was found. For the first time we showed that the gene LRRC3B was frequently methylated and/or deleted in breast carcinoma - 32% of samples, cervical - 35%, lung - 40%, renal - 35%, ovarian - 28%, colon - 33% and prostate cancer - 44%. To check these results bisulfite sequencing using cloned PCR products with representative two breast, one cervical, two renal, two ovarian and two colon cancer samples was performed. In all cases methylation was confirmed. Expression analysis using RT-qPCR showed that LRRC3B is strongly down-regulated at the latest stages of RCC and ovarian cancers. In addition we showed that LRRC3B exhibit strong cell growth inhibiting activity (more than 95%) in colony formation experiments in vitro in KRC/Y renal cell carcinoma line. All these data suggest that LRRC3B gene could be involved in the process of carcinogenesis as a tumor suppressor gene.
