MR imaging of multifocal autoimmune pancreatitis in the pancreatic head and tail: a case report. Autoimmune pancreatitis, unlike alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, is a rare variant of pancreatitis. We describe the MR imaging findings in a 50-year-old man with multifocal autoimmune pancreatitis in the pancreatic head and tail. Our case demonstrates multifocal enlargement, diminished signal intensity on a T1-weighted image, and delayed enhancement with the capsule-like hypointense bands in a dynamic study. MR cholangiopancreatography is also found to be useful in evaluating the effectiveness of steroid therapy.
