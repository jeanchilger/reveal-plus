Contrast-enhanced hepatic MRI: comparison of half-dose and standard-dose gadolinium DTPA administration in lesion characterization with T1-weighted gradient echo sequences. The objective of this article was to compare half-dose (0.05 mm/kg) gadolinium-enhanced dynamic hepatic MR imaging to standard doses (0.10 mm/kg). Eighteen patients for follow-up hepatic MR received 0.05 mm/kg of gadolinium DTPA dynamically with gradient-echo imaging. Imaging parameters were identical to a 0.10-mm/kg study patients were imaged during multiple phases of contrast enhancement. Two readers assessed for enhancement patterns and characterization. Quantitative signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) were obtained for abdominal viscera and contrast-to-noise ratios (C/N) were obtained on up to three lesions. No significant difference for the arterial dominant phase (P > 0.05) was found. Significant differences were found in all categories during the portal venous phase (except pancreas) and equilibrium phase (except liver). Lesion C/N ratios were not significant at any point (P > 0.05). Sixty-two out of 64 lesions (97%) were identically characterized. Therefore, half-dose dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR may have diagnostic value.
