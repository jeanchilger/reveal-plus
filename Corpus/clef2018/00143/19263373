A case of pancreatic Burkitt lymphoma: radiological findings. Burkitt lymphoma predominantly involving the pancreas is very rare. There is no specific clinical, laboratory, or radiological sign of the disease. Thus, the diagnosis, especially of focal involvement, is usually difficult. We here report ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings of primary pancreatic Burkitt lymphoma in a case with unusual radiological presentation.
