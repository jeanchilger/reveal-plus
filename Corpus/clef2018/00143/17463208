Spiral saphenous vein graft for portal vein reconstruction in pancreatic cancer surgery. The curative strategy for most pancreatic cancer is surgical resection. Extensive resection with lymph node dissection is the key to providing long-term survival. However, early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is not always possible (ie, resectability is limited). One reason for such a nonresectable condition is vascular invasion or encasement. Portal vein involvement has been a contraindication for pancreatic cancer surgery for most general surgeons. Combining oncologic and vascular surgeons in the procedure has been a good solution. A multidisciplinary approach that includes general and vascular surgeons is appropriate in selected patients requiring vascular reconstruction at the time of pancreatectomy. The objective of this paper is to report a case in which spiral saphenous vein was used for portal vein reconstruction during pancreatic cancer resection.
