Multiple hypervascular pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma: dynamic MR and spiral CT in three cases. Pancreatic metastases are rare. Melanoma, lung cancer and breast carcinoma are the most common origin of pancreatic metastases, whereas renal cell carcinoma is counted in only 1-2%. Renal cell carcinoma usually leads to a solitary pancreatic metastasis, whereas multiple pancreatic metastases are uncommon. We present three cases of multiple hypervascular pancreatic metastases from renal cell carcinoma, studied with spiral CT and dynamic MR.
