Correlation between contingent negative variation and regional cerebral blood flow. The relationship between contingent negative variation (CNV) and regional cerebral blood flow was investigated, using the stable xenon computed tomography method. Seventeen cases of chronic multiple cerebral infarction in the perforating artery areas (vascular dementia, mean age 67.0), 6 cases of Alzheimer's disease (mean age 69.5) and 8 healthy controls (mean age 62.5) were studied. Regional cerebral blood flows in the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortex, frontal, temporal and occipital white matter, caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus were measured. The amplitude of early CNV was significantly smaller in the vascular dementia group than in the healthy control group. The blood flows in the parietal cortex and thalamus were significantly lower in the vascular dementia group than in the healthy control group. There was a significant positive correlation between the amplitude of early CNV and frontal cortex blood flow. No significant correlations were present between the CNV and the other regional cerebral blood flows nor in healthy controls. The amplitude of CNV has been reported to be decreased in dementia. From the present study, the amplitude of early CNV was considered to be influenced by the blood flow in the frontal cortex.
