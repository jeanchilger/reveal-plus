Photoimmobilization of sulfated hyaluronic acid for antithrombogenicity. Anticoagulant polymer sulfated hyaluronic acid was patterned immobilized on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film in a specific pattern by photolithography. Hyaluronic acid was sulfated by a sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex. The polymer was coupled with azidoaniline. The derivatized polymer was cast on a PET film from aqueous solution. After drying, the film was photoirradiated in the presence or absence of a photomask. The micropatterning was confirmed by staining with a dye, brilliant green. Since the anticoagulant polymer has negative charges, the cationic dye was adsorbed on the regions where the anticoagulant polymer was immobilized. Platelet adhesion was reduced on the sulfated hyaluronic acid-immobilized areas. The immobilized sulfated hyaluronic acid significantly reduced thrombus formation.
