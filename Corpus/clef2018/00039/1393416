Treatment planning for 131I-mIBG radiotherapy of neural crest tumours using 124I-mIBG positron emission tomography. Patients designated to receive 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanadine (mIBG) for the treatment of neural crest tumours have been scanned with 124I-mIBG using the MUP-PET positron camera. Uptake was detected in tumour sites in lung, liver and abdomen. The tomographic images produced have allowed estimates to be made of the concentration of mIBG in both tumour and normal tissue. From these data it is possible to predict the radiation doses that would be achieved using therapy levels (up to 11 GBq) of 131I-mIBG. The levels of tumour uptake are between 0.5 and 2.0 kBq/g indicating that the radiation doses to tumour would be in the range 3 Gy to 7.5 Gy.
