The contribution of functional imaging techniques to our understanding of rheumatic pain. The main cerebral components of the human pain matrix have been defined using functional imaging techniques. The experience of pain is likely to be elaborated as a result of parallel processing within this matrix. There is not, therefore, a single pain center. The determinants of pain are as likely to be determined by top-down as by bottom-up processes. The precise function of the different components of the matrix are just beginning to be defined. There appear to be important adaptive responses in the forebrain components of the matrix during arthritic pain. Endogenous opioid peptides are strong candidates for the modulation of some of these responses. More extensive and sequential behavioral and functional imaging studies are required to establish the contribution these adaptive responses make to the perception of pain.
