New methods for the staging of colorectal cancer using noninvasive techniques. Noninvasive differentiation of benign from malignant disease has emerged as an important diagnostic challenge in this age of health-care cost containment. Most physicians today acknowledge that early and accurate detection of cancer is the key to successful treatment. Antibodies have been developed and used to detect and treat tumors. In the next few years, several radiolabeled antibodies will likely receive FDA approval for imaging colorectal, lung, and prostate carcinomas, thus expanding and improving the physician's ability to detect and follow cancer in patients. There is ample evidence in the literature that suggests that imaging with labeled antibodies is clinically useful for detecting colorectal cancer in patients with suspected recurrence, in patients with presumed isolated resectable liver metastasis, and in those at high risk of the development of recurrence. This paper reviews these studies, and also discusses some data obtained from positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in colorectal patients.
