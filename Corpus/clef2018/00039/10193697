A unified reconstruction framework for both parallel-beam and variable focal-length fan-beam collimators by a Cormack-type inversion of exponential radon transform. A variety of inversions of exponential Radon transform has been derived based on the circular harmonic transform in Fourier space by several research groups. However, these inversions cannot be directly applied to deal with the reconstruction for fan-beam or variable-focal-length fan-beam collimator geometries in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In this paper, we derived a Cormack-type inversion of the exponential Radon transform by employing the circular harmonic transform directly in the projection space and the image space instead of the Fourier space. Thus, a unified reconstruction framework is established for parallel-, fan-, and variable-focal-length fan-beam collimator geometries. Compared to many existing algorithms, the presented one greatly mitigates the difficulty of image reconstruction due to the complicated collimator geometry and significantly reduces the computational burden of the special functions, such as Chebyshev or Bessel functions. By the well-established fast-Fourier transform (FFT), our algorithm is very efficient, as demonstrated by several numerical simulations.
