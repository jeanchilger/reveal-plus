Noninvasive evaluation of microscopic tumor extensions using standardized uptake value and metabolic tumor volume in non-small-cell lung cancer. To prospectively evaluate whether maximal microscopic extensions (MEmax) correlate with maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) at 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Thirty-nine patients with Stage I-IIIA NSCLC underwent surgery after FDG-PET/CT scanning. SUVmax and MTV were calculated on the PET/CT images. The maximum linear distance from the tumor margin to the farthest extent of the tumor in every dimension was measured at the tumor section. The correlations among MEmax, SUVmax, MTV and other clinical pathologic parameters were analyzed.MEmax for all patients had a significant correlation with SUVmax (r = 0.777, p = 0.008) and MTV (r = 0.724, p < 0.001). When expressed in terms of the probability of covering ME with respect to a given margin, we suggested that margins of 1.93 mm, 3.90 mm, and 9.60 mm for SUVmax ≤ 5, 5-10, and >10 added to the gross tumor volume would be adequate to cover 95% of ME.This study demonstrated that tumors with high SUVmax and MTV have more MEmax and would therefore require more margin expansion from gross tumor volume to clinical target volume. FDG-PET/CT, especially for SUVmax, is promising and effective and merits additional study in noninvasive delimiting of the clinical target volume margin for NSCLC.
