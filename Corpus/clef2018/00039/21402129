Positron emission tomography with 11C-flumazenil in the rat shows preservation of binding sites during the acute phase after 2 h-transient focal ischemia. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies in humans have used (11)C-flumazenil (FMZ) to assess neuronal viability after stroke. Here we aimed to study whether (11)C-FMZ binding was sensitive to neuronal damage in the acute phase following ischemia/reperfusion in the rat brain.Transient (2 h followed by reperfusion) and permanent intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion was carried out. (11)C-FMZ binding was studied by PET up to 24 h after the onset of ischemia. Tissue infarction was evaluated post-mortem at 24 h. Immunohistochemistry against a neuronal nuclei specific protein (NeuN) was performed to assess neuronal injury.No decrease in (11)C-FMZ binding was detected in the ipsilateral cortex up to 24 h post-ischemia in the model of transient occlusion despite the fact that rats developed cortical and striatal infarction, and neuronal injury was clearly apparent at this time. In contrast, (11)C-FMZ binding was significantly depressed in the ipsilateral cortex at 24 h following permanent ischemia.This finding evidences that (11)C-FMZ binding is not sensitive to neuronal damage on the acute phase of ischemia/reperfusion in the rat brain.
