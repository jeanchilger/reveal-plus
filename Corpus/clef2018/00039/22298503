Preparation of neutron-activatable holmium nanoparticles for the treatment of ovarian cancer metastases. Nanoparticles containing stable holmium ((165) Ho) are prepared by nanotemplate engineering and subsequently irradiated in a neutron flux to yield (166) Ho, a beta-emitting radiotherapeutic isotope. After intraperitoneal injection to mice bearing SKOV-3 ovarian tumors, significant tumor accumulation of the (166) Ho-nanoparticles is observed by SPECT imaging indicating the potential of these neutron activatable nanoparticles for internal radiation therapy of ovarian cancer metastases.
