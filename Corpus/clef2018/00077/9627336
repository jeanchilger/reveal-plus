Fluorine-18-FDG PET imaging is negative in bronchioloalveolar lung carcinoma. The goals of our study were to establish PET accuracy with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in finding localized formations of bronchioloalveolar lung carcinoma (BAC) and to investigate the correlation between FDG uptake and the degree of cell differentiation in adenocarcinoma of the lung.Twenty-nine patients with 30 adenocarcinomas of the lung (7 bronchioloalveolar lung carcinomas, 9 well differentiated, 2 well-moderately differentiated, 11 moderately differentiated and 1 poorly differentiated) were studied. All patients underwent thoracotomies within 4 wk after the FDG PET study. For qualitative analysis, the degree of FDG activity in the tumors was visually scored using a five-point grading system: 0 = same to background activity, 1 = less than mediastinal blood-pool activity, 2 = same to mediastinal blood-pool activity, 3 = slightly greater than mediastinal blood-pool activity and 4 = substantially greater than mediastinal blood-pool activity. Foci of activity with Grades 2-4 were considered tumors. For semiquantitative analysis, standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated.In 7 BACs, 4 lesions (57%) showed negative results on FDG PET, while in 23 non-BACs, only 1 lesion (4%), which was a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma showed a negative result. BACs' mean visual score (1.43 +/- 1.27) was significantly lower than that of non-BACs (3.17 +/- 1.03) (p = 0.001). The BACs' mean SUV (1.36 +/- 0.821) was significantly lower than that of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas (2.92 +/- 1.28) (p = 0.014) the mean SUV of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas was significantly lower than that of moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas (4.63 +/- 1.86) (p = 0.031). No significant differences were apparent in average size among these three histologic types.A correlation was observed between FDG uptake and the degree of cell differentiation in adenocarcinoma of the lung. FDG PET may show negative results for BAC.
