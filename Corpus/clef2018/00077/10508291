Diagnosis of microvasculopathy in CNS vasculitis: value of perfusion and diffusion imaging. Functional imaging may come to play an important role in the evaluation of CNS vasculitis by demonstrating pathology on the microcirculatory level. A positive finding of microvascular ischemia may assist in the diagnosis of CNS vasculitis. More importantly, the demonstration of normal microcirculation may reliably exclude CNS vasculitis.
