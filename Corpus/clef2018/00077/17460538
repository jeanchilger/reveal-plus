Role of 18F-dopa PET/CT imaging in the management of patients with 111In-pentetreotide negative GEP tumours. To assess whether 18F-dopa PET/CT is able to provide information relevant in changing the clinical management of patients with gastro-enteropancreatic (GEP) tumours where there is negative or inconclusive conventional radiological imaging (ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy.From January 2005 to October 2006, 84 patients with clinical and biochemical suspicion of GEP tumours were investigated by US and CT scans, MRI and 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy. In 13/84 (15.4%) both conventional radiological imaging and 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy provided negative or inconclusive findings, and patients were referred for 18F-dopa PET/CT imaging. Each patient received 5.3 MBq x kg(-1) 18F-dopa intravenously, and imaged 60 min later using a hybrid PET/CT scanner.18F-dopa PET/CT detected the primary tumour in all 13 patients (size range, 7-26 mm, mean, 18 mm SUVmax range, 2.3-16.3, mean, 5.7) and further 12 unsuspected lesions (size range, 12-23 mm, mean 17Our preliminary results suggest that 18F-dopa PET/CT has a promising role in GEP patients with negative or inconclusive findings at conventional radiological imaging and 111In-pentetreotide scintigraphy. The findings were helpful in biopsy guidance and played a major role in changing the management of those patients.
