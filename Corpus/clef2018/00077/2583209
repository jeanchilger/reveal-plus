PET and MR imaging in a neuro-Behçet syndrome. Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed on a case of neuro-Behçet's syndrome. In accordance with the clinical signs, FDG PET (using 18F-labeled 2-F-2'-desoxyglucose) revealed disseminated storage defects in the cerebrum and cerebellum. Focal regions of enhanced signal intensity were demonstrated in the parietal white matter of the cerebrum in T2-weighted images and in the brain stem by MRI.
