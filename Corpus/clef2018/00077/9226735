Central 5-HT2A and D2 dopamine receptor occupancy after sublingual administration of ORG 5222 in healthy men. It has been suggested that a combined blockade of 5-HT2A and D2-dopamine receptors improves efficacy and reduces the risk for extrapyramidal symptoms when treating schizophrenic patients with antipsychotic drugs. ORG 5222 is a new potential antipsychotic drug which has high affinity for 5-HT2A, D2-dopamine and alpha 1 adrenergic receptors in vitro. The objective of this study was to examine if ORG 5222 occupies 5-HT2A and D2-dopamine receptors in human subjects in vivo. Central receptor occupancy was measured by positron emission tomography (PET) in three healthy subjects after sublingual administration of 100 micrograms ORG 5222. [11C]N-methylspiperone ([11C] NMSP) was the radioligand used to measure 5-HT2A receptor binding in the neocortex and [11C]raclopride to measure D2-dopamine receptor binding in the striatum. The 5-HT2A occupancy was 15-30% and the D2-dopamine receptor occupancy was 12-23%. The study confirms that ORG 5222 binds to 5-HT2A and D2-dopamine receptors in human brain. Since receptor occupancy of ORG 5222 is rather low, doses higher than 100 micrograms are suggested in future clinical trials to evaluate the antipsychotic drug effect of ORG 5222.
