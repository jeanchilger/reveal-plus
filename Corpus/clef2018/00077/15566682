MRI representations of glioma radioencephalopathy. Correctly distinguishing normal tissue reactive changes, tumor residue or relapse, and radioencephalopathy of glioma after radiotherapy by imaging methods is difficult. This study was to analysis MRI representations of glioma radioencephalopathy.MRI records of 5 patients with golima radioencephalopathy treated in our hospital from Sept. 1998 to May 2004 were collected, 4 cases were confirmed by operation, and 1 was diagnosed by MRI and PET. All these 5 cases were suspected recurrence in MRI scans after 1 or 2 radiotherapy periods, but them were confirmed radioencephalopathy pathologically after excision.MRI revealed all patients deteriorated within 40 days to 7 months. The edema aggravated (5/5), and most were moderate or severe (4/5). Space occupying signs aggravated (5/5). Lesions enlarged (5/5) with irregular shapes like coral, map, or ring in enhanced scans.Radioencephalopathy of glioma occurs within 2 years after radiotherapy mostly. MRI scans manifest edema and space occupying signs aggravated, meanwhile the lesions enlarged progressively in a rather short time. It is characteristic that enhanced lesions were irregular and radiate.
