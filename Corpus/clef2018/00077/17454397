Newly developed hybrid suture without lubricant: noninvasive in vivo assessment of biocompatibility with multiparametric MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance (MR) relaxometry were used to assess noninvasively the tissue response of a new uncoated hybrid braided suture made from a combination of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and polyester (polyethylene terephthalate) (PET) yarns in comparison to a silicone impregnated braided 100% polyester (PET) control suture (Ticron). Both biomaterials were monitored for a period of 30 days following implantation in both incised and nonincised paravertebral rabbit muscles. In all cases, MR images and relaxometry demonstrated that the hybrid suture elicited either a milder or a similar tissue and cellular response compared to the control suture. These findings were confirmed by conventional histological analysis of the surrounding tissues. They also demonstrated that the hybrid suture promoted faster healing in terms of collagen infiltration between the yarns and individual filaments. This milder inflammatory reaction and improved biocompatibility represent a real advantage in the healing performance of sutures for cardiac and vascular surgery, and support the need for continued research and development of hybrid structures. This study also demonstrated the ability of MRI techniques to noninvasively evaluate the biocompatibility of biomaterials. By extending the capacity of MR diagnostic tools from patients to experimental animals, it is now possible to validate the healing performance of foreign materials with statistical reliability and fewer animals.
