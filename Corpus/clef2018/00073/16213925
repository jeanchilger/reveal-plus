Beef, pork, and milk allergy (cross reactivity with each other and pet allergies). The purposes of this study were to examine milk allergic patients to determine concomitant reactivity between milk, beef, pork and cat and dog dander and other common inhalant allergens.19 patients were selected according to their Immuno-CAP results, which had increased Ig-E levels against milk, pork or beef. Patients were also tested against Johnson grass, short ragweed, cat/dog dander and d. farina.Pearson's test revealed strong correlation between beef and pork, beef and milk, pork and milk Ig-E counts (consecutively r2 = 0.89, r2 = 0.81, r2 = 0.60 and p < 0.01. All cat allergic patients also appeared to be allergic to either beef/pork meat or milk. The correlation between pork and dog dander Ig-E counts was also significant (r2 = 0.38, p < 0.01). No correlation detected between milk-meat-pet and grass-weed-dust allergies.Patients who are known to have pet allergies may need to be screened for meat and milk allergy. Milk allergic patients may also need to avoid cows and pork meat.
