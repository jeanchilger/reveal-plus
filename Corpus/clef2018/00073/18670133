Cloning and characterization of a tau glutathione S-transferase subunit encoding gene in Gossypium hirsutum. A predicted tau Glutathione S-transferase (GST) subunit encoding gene, named GhGST, was isolated from Gossypium hirsutum with RACE method from SSH library based on Verticillium dahliae stress. The data revealed an open reading frame of 678 bp encoding a protein of 225 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25.821 kDa. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA of GhGST was expressed in root, stem and leaf. And the content of GhGST expression increased under Verticillium dahliae stress in root. The expression of GhGST gene was verified by transformation in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain with the recombinant expression vector pET-32A. GST activity assay showed the crude GhGST protein had obvious activity to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) substrate.
