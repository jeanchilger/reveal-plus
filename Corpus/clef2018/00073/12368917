Cost-effective PET investigations in oncology. The authors have reviewed the financial considerations of oncological FDG PET examinations by the guidelines of the Health Care Financing Administration (USA). By critical assessment of large number of clinical investigations,the cost-effectiveness of FDG PET scans has been confirmed in the following cases: differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodule, diagnosis,staging and restaging of non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, malignant lymphomas, melanoma malignum, esophageal neoplasms and cancers of the head and neck. The role of this method in breast cancer is currently under intensive investigation. Due to the correct staging, PET examinations in these indications enable the clinicians to choose the optimal treatment ensuring the maximum probability of recovery and being cost-effective as unnecessary medical interventions become avoidable.
