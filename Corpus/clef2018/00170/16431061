The impact of incubating the throat culture for 72 h on the diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. The accurate detection and treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is important to prevent the potential sequels. Throat culture remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. Many authors recommended 48 h incubation time for the isolation of group A Streptococcus (GAS). In this study the diagnostic efficacy of prolonging the incubation time of throat cultures to 72 h for isolation of GAS was researched.Throat swab specimens were inoculated to 5% sheep blood agar plate and incubated at 37 degrees C, and evaluated at the 24th hour. GAS negative plates were incubated again for another 24h and read at the 48th hour. Negative plates at 48 h were incubated again, read at the 72nd hour, and positive results of all measurements were evaluated.A total of 367 cultures were examined. At the 24th hour evaluation 34 (9.3%) cultures were positive for GAS. Evaluation of 333 cultures that were found to be negative in the first 24th hour evaluation revealed 44 (13.6%) positive cultures at 48th hour evaluation. Out of 289 cultures that were negative during the 48th hour evaluation, an additional 13 (4.7%) cultures were found to be positive during the 72nd hour evaluation. The agreement between 24th-48th and 24th and 72nd were both moderate (kappa 0.54 and 0. 46, respectively), and between 48th and 72nd hour was very good (kappa: 0.90).Throat cultures that are negative for GAS at 24h should be incubated for second day. We conclude that, to confirm the throat cultures GAS negative, results of throat cultures need to be incubated for 72 h, since 72nd hour evaluations revealed additional 5% positive results.
