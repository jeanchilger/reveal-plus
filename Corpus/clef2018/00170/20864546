emm typing, antibiotic resistance and PFGE analysis of Streptococcus pyogenes in Lebanon. One hundred and three Streptococcus pyogenes isolates recovered mainly from streptococcal throat infections in Lebanon were characterized by emm and PFGE typing. Thirty-three emm types and subtypes were detected among the isolates. PFGE was more discriminatory as a typing method. The prevalent emm types were emm1 (12.6 %), emm22 (8.7 %), emm28 (7.7 %), emm88 (7.7 %) and emm4 (6.8 %) and all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and penicillin G. Ten per cent of the isolates were resistant to erythromycin and 3 % were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, showing the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B phenotype. The emm sequences and PFGE pattern database that were generated in this study will serve as a basis for information for long-term evolutionary and epidemiological studies of local S. pyogenes recovered not only in Lebanon, but also in neighbouring countries.
