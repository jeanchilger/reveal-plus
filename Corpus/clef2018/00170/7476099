Characterisation of group A streptococcal isolates from tropical Australia with high prevalence of rheumatic fever: probing for signature sequences to identify members of the family of serotype 5. The prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in Northern Territory Aboriginal communities is high, but there is a low isolation rate of historically rheumatic fever associated M types (such as M5) of group A streptococci (GAS). Many isolates are M non-typable (MNT). Serology suggests that the population is exposed to M5-like isolates some RHD patients having high IgM or IgG titres to two M5 B-repeat region peptide epitopes, B1 (KQQESK) and B4 (EQKSKQ). To identify relatives of M5 in our collection of GAS, oligonucleotide probes to the B1 and B4-repeat regions shared by M5 and a local M5-like isolate, were used to screen 101 isolates for the presence of signature sequences. In all, 28% of the tropical Australian isolates contained the signature sequences, identifying members of the M5 family. The 5' region of the genes for M proteins from three members of the M5 family fell into two sequence types. Hybridisation to probes based on these sequences suggested that among tropical Australian isolates there are at least three distinct sequence types that contained the M5 signature sequences. These results suggest that a considerable number of M5 family GAS are circulating in tropical Australia.
