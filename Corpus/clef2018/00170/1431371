Rapid diagnosis of influenza infection by PCR method--detection of influenza virus HA gene in throat swab. We studied the detection of the HA gene of human influenza viruses in throat swabs obtained from the outbreaks of influenza in school children utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Sensitivity and specificity of the PCR method was compared to conventional virus isolation using MDCK cells. Three pairs of primers for PCR in detecting the HA genes of AH1, AH3, and B influenza viruses showed both subtype and type specificity. The dilution experiments showed that influenza viruses, as few as 1.1-3.5 plaque-forming units per 50 microliters, were sufficient for the detection of HA genes by PCR method and the detection rate by PCR method was 2-3 fold higher than that by conventional method. Our results showed that the PCR method was a fast, sensitive and reliable method for the diagnosis of influenza infections.
