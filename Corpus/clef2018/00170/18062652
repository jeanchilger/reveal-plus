Human neutrophil peptides in vaginitis/cervicitis of different etiology. Development of female genito-urinary infections depends on many factors, such as immune system activity, virulence of microorganism and production of factors inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. Taking into account the possibility of relapses or severe complications, it is very important to appropriately diagnose and treat infections. Because of recently observed increase of microbial resistance to antibiotics, researchers are looking for alternatives. In our study we evaluated and compared the concentration of human neutrophil peptides (HNP 1-3) in cervico-vaginal lavages (CVL), obtained from women with vaginitis/cervicitis. Swabs from the posterior vaginal fornix and from the endocervical canal as well as CVL samples were obtained from 32 patients with vaginitis/cervicitis and 29 healthy women (control group). Supernatants of CVL were used for determination of concentration of HNP by ELISA. The difference between concentrations of HNP 1-3 in studied and control groups was statistically significant (p = 0.018). The maximal concentration was determined in patients with mixed infections (28.41 ng/ml), and Group B Streptococci, GBS, (28.06 ng/ml), the minimal concentrations in cases of C. trachomatis (mean concentrations did not differ from those in the control group: 16.93 ng/ml and 16.39 ng/ml, respectively). Maximal correlation was determined for control-studied group with isolation of GBS (r = 0.79), and very high negative correlation for group of GBS - C. trachomatis (r = -0.98).
