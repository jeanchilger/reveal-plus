Detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae by polymerase chain reaction-enzyme immunoassay in an immunocompromised population. Chlamydia pneumoniae has now been associated with pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, acute chest syndrome of sickle cell disease, and asthma. Because of the difficulty of primary isolation and tissue-culture adaptation of this organism, we used a previously developed polymerase chain reaction-enzyme immunoassay (PCR-EIA) to screen 132 culture-negative bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from 108 immunocompromised patients (34% of whom were positive for human immunodeficiency virus) and 7 healthy volunteers. Thirteen specimens (9.8%) from 12 immunocompromised patients (11.1%) gave a positive result one patient had two positive specimens obtained 3 days apart. No healthy volunteer had a PCR-EIA-positive BAL specimen. Twelve (11.1%) of the immunocompromised patients also had diagnostic levels of antibody. Four patients had positive results in both PCR-EIA and serological tests. Thus 20 (18.5%) of the 108 patients had laboratory evidence of C. pneumoniae infection. These data indicate that diagnosis of acute infection with C. pneumoniae can be established more rapidly and reliably by PCR-EIA than by culture or serology, particularly among immunocompromised patients, in whom serological changes in response to infection are relatively undependable. With an infection rate of 11.1% according to PCR-EIA, C. pneumoniae should be considered in the evaluation and treatment of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.
