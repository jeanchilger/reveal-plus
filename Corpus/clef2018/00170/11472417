Skin T cell proliferative response to M protein and other cell wall and membrane proteins of group A streptococci in chronic plaque psoriasis. To determine and compare the T cell response to M protein and other group A streptococcal (GAS) antigens, T cell lines (TCL) were cultured from the lesional skin of 33 psoriatic patients and 17 disease controls. GAS-reactive skin TCL were tested in proliferation assays with recombinant M6 protein, and extracts of cell wall and membrane from type M6 GAS and its corresponding M gene deletion mutant. Initially, GAS-reactive skin TCL were obtained from 16 of 25 (64%) psoriasis, and from seven of 17 (41%) control patients. Eleven psoriatic and four control GAS-reactive TCL proliferated to M6 cell wall extract, whereas all the TCL from both groups responded to the extract of M6 membrane proteins. This difference in response to the two extracts was significant for both groups of patients (psoriasis, P = 0.0335, controls, P = 0.0156). GAS-reactive TCL from a further eight psoriasis patients showed no difference in response to cell wall extract from M6 GAS (containing the M protein minus its C-terminus) compared to that of its corresponding M gene deletion mutant. Furthermore, GAS-reactive TCL did not proliferate to recombinant M6 protein. However, a small, but significant reduction in proliferation by the eight psoriatic GAS-reactive TCL to the M-negative (lacking the M protein C-terminus) compared to M6-positive membrane extract was observed (P = 0.01). These findings suggest that GAS-reactive T cells in skin lesions of chronic plaque psoriasis proliferate to streptococcal membrane and, to a lesser extent, cell wall proteins. However, psoriatic skin T cells do not recognize cell wall M protein.
