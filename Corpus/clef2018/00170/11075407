Diagnosis and antibiotic therapy of infections in outpatients. The study aim was to analyse the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to selected infectious diseases, in particular with regard to the use of antibiotics, in the light of current guidelines and the problem of developing resistance.A questionnaire was sent to all physicians with a general or internal medicine practice in the Cantons Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft, Switzerland.Of 440 physicians, 286 (65%) took part in the study. The most frequent diagnoses of infection were cystitis (16.6%), flu-like syndrome (16.4%), acute bronchitis (12.3%), and tonsillopharyngitis (10.1%). The most frequent indications for antimicrobial therapy were cystitis (19.9%), acute sinusitis (14.1%), acute bronchitis (11.5%), and tonsillopharyngitis (9.2%). Macrolides (24.0%), aminopenicillins (22.6%), and fluoroquinolones (16.8%) were the most frequently prescribed antibiotics.The majority of physicians diagnosed and treated according to rational principles. However, a few exceptions were found, e.g. omission of x-ray in the diagnosis of pneumonia (24%), the use of antibiotics in the treatment of viral diseases and antibiotic therapy for tonsillopharyngitis despite a negative rapid antigen detection test against group A streptococci (75%).
