Diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: a practice guideline. Infectious Diseases Society of America. This is the second in a series of practice guidelines commissioned by the Infectious Diseases Society of America through its Practice Guidelines Committee. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide assistance to clinicians when making decisions on treating the conditions specified in each guideline. The targeted providers are pediatricians, family practitioners, and internists. The targeted patients and setting for the acute pharyngitis guideline are pediatric, adolescent, and adult outpatients with a complaint of sore throat. Funding was provided by the IDSA. Panel members represented experts in adult and pediatric infectious diseases. The guidelines are evidence-based. A standard ranking system was used for the strength of the recommendations and the quality of the evidence cited in the literature reviewed. The document has been subjected to external review by peer reviewers as well as by the Practice Guidelines Committee and was approved by the IDSA Council. An executive summary, algorithms, and tables highlight the major recommendations. Indicators of quality will assist in guideline implementation. The guideline will be listed on the IDSA home page at http://www.idsociety.org.
