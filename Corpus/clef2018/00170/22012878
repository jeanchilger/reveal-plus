Selective antibody response to Streptococcus gallolyticus pilus proteins in colorectal cancer patients. Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (previously called Streptococcus bovis biotype I) infections have long been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). This work aimed to investigate the CRC-associated humoral immune response to four pilus proteins of this bacterium by newly developed ELISAs. Pilus proteins are interesting diagnostic targets as they are the building blocks of pilin-like structures that mediate bacterial virulence and are readily exposed to the host immune system upon infection. The presence of serum antibodies against these pilus proteins was evaluated in Dutch and American populations. These analyses showed that an immune response to these antigens was specific for clinical S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus infections, but that increased serum antibody titers to multiple pilus proteins in single individuals were rarely observed. However, a multiplex approach based on antibody titers against any of these four antigens resulted in assay sensitivities between 16% and 43% for the detection of early-stage CRC. Together these findings underscore the potential of a multi-antigen approach to complement diagnosis of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus-associated CRC.
