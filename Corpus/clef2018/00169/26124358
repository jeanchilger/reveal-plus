Splenectomy Followed by Hepatectomy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Hypersplenism and Portal Hypertension Caused by Macroglobulinemia. To describe a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accompanied by hypersplenism and portal hypertension caused by macroglobulinemia, who underwent splenectomy followed by hepatectomy.A 74-year-old man was admitted to our Hospital. He had previously developed primary macroglobulinemia, which had been completely cured by chemotherapy. At admission, he had a low platelet count (52 × 10(3)/μl), and his liver function was impaired. Imaging showed a 5-cm-sized tumor, an esophageal varix, and splenomegaly, but not liver cirrhosis. The patient underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism and portal hypertension the weight of his spleen was 2,400 g. After splenectomy, his platelet count increased to 259 × 10(3)/μl and his liver function was improved. He safely underwent hepatectomy for HCC. The patient was discharged 14 days later without morbidity.These findings suggest that hepatectomy following splenectomy for hypersplenism and portal hypertension caused by macroglobulinemia, may effectively cure HCC in patients with liver dysfunction and thrombocytopenia.
