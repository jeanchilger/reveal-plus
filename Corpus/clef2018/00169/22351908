Efficacy of the omental roll-up technique in pancreaticojejunostomy as a strategy to prevent pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Most morbidity and mortality are caused by a pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and its prevention is the major concern. We applied the omental roll-up technique around pancreaticojejunostomy and investigated the effectiveness of this technique to prevent a pancreatic fistula.Retrospective study.Tertiary hepatobiliary and pancreas surgery clinic, Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul.Between March 1, 2009, and March 31, 2011, 68 patients underwent PD. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the surgical application of the omental roll-up technique around the PJ site: group 1 (those who did not undergo the omental roll-up technique) compared with group 2 (those who did undergo the omental roll-up technique).The occurrence of a pancreatic fistula.No differences were noted in the clinical characteristics, including patients' demographics and operation-related factors, between the 2 groups. A pancreatic fistula occurred in 23 of 39 patients in group 1 (59%) and in 6 of 29 patients in group 2 (20.7%). Group 2 had a significantly lower incidence of pancreatic fistula (P = .002), and these fistulas were classified as being grade A using the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula Definition showing a transient high amylase level in the drainage fluid without significantly affecting the patient's recovery. Drain removal was performed earlier in group 2 (P < .001). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 23.4 days in group 1 compared with 15.9 days in group 2 (P = .009). Overall mortality was 1.5% however, no deaths were related to a pancreatic fistula.The omental roll-up technique for the PJ site definitely reduced the occurrence of a pancreatic fistula. Therefore, the omental roll-up technique is a simple and effective strategy to prevent a pancreatic fistula.
