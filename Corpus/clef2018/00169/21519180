A case of portal hypertension after the treatment of oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer. We report herein a case of 35-years-old woman in whom portal hypertension (esophageal varix and splenomegaly) developed after 12 cycles of oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer. She was transferred for the evaluation of etiology of new-onset portal hypertension. The esophageal varix and splenomegaly were absent before the oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy. Thorough history taking and serological exam revealed no evidence of chronic liver disease. Liver biopsy was done and there was no cirrhotic nodule formation. Instead, perivenular fibrosis was noted. Considering new development of esophageal varices and splenomegaly after 12 cycles of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy, we could conclude that portal hypertension in this patient were due to sinusoidal injury by oxaliplatin. Finally, we recommend regular follow-up with endoscopy and radiologic examination for checking the development of varices and for screening of varices and splenomegaly in patients with colo-rectal cancer who receive oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
