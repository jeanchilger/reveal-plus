The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on FDG-PET is a strong predictor of local recurrence for localized non-small-cell lung cancer after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of FDG-PET may predict local recurrence for localized non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).Among 195 localized NSCLCs that were treated with total doses of either 40Gy or 50Gy in 5 SBRT fractions, we reviewed those patients who underwent pre-treatment FDG-PET using a single scanner for staging. Local control rates (LCRs) were obtained by the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test. Prognostic significance was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses.A total of 95 patients with 97 lesions were eligible. Median follow-up was 16.0months (range: 6.0-46.3months). Local recurrences occurred in 9 lesions. By multivariate analysis, only the SUVmax of a primary tumor was a significant predictor (p=0.002). Two years LCRs for lower SUVmax (<6.0 n=78) and higher SUVmax (⩾6SUVmax was the strongest predictor for local recurrence. A high SUVmax may be considered for dose escalation to improve local control. Additional follow-up is needed to determine if SUVmax is correlated with regional recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival.
