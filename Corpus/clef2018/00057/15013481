Quantitative measurement of histamine H(1) receptors in human brains by PET and [11C]doxepin. The aim of this study is to establish a method for quantitative measurement of histamine H(1) receptor (H1R) in human brain by PET and [(11)C]doxepin ([(11)C]DOX). The estimated parameters with a two-compartment model were stable for the initial values for parameter estimation but those with a three-compartment model were not. This finding suggests that the H1R measured by the [(11)C]DOX and PET can be evaluated with a two-compartment model.
