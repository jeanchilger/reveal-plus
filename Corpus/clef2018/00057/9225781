Technetium-99m-tetrofosmin SPECT imaging of lung masses: a negative study. Technetium-99m-tetrofosmin has emerged as a new radiopharmaceutical for myocardial imaging, in competition with 201Tl and 99mTc-MIBI. In this study, 99mTc-tetrofosmin was evaluated for its ability to detect malignant and benign lesions from single solid lung masses.Forty-nine patients with a single solid lung mass based on chest radiograph findings received 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT of the chest to evaluate the value of 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT for detecting malignant and benign lesions.Only 61% of the lung malignancies were detected by 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT of the chest, including 53% of epidermoid carcinoma (ca), 67% of adeno ca, 75% of small-cell ca, 0% of undifferentiated large-cell ca and 100% of other lung malignancies. In addition, 50% of the benign lesions were detected by chest 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT. The probability of tetrofosmin uptake in the mass was not related to mass size. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 61%, 50% and 59%, respectively, for differentiating malignant and benign lesions when diagnosing a single solid lung mass.Technetium-99m-tetrofosmin SPECT of the chest is of little or no value for the detection of lung ca from single solid lung masses.
