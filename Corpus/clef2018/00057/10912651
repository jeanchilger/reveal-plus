Primary non-small-cell lung cancer: determining the suitability of the patient and tumor for resection. Choosing resective surgery for patients with bronchogenic carcinoma requires assessments of tumor suitability and patient suitability. Tumor suitability is largely dependent on the assessed stage of the tumor complex, based on characteristics of the primary tumor, detection of lymph node metastases, and detection of distant metastases. Imaging tests that assist in the determination of tumor stage include computed tomographic scans and positron emission tomographic (PET) scans. PET scans are more sensitive and specific than computed tomography. PET is also helpful in screening for distant metastases. Mediastinoscopy is required in most cases of mediastinal adenopathy. Patient suitability is assessed by predicting short-term surgical mortality, and the likelihood of crippling long-term respiratory failure. There is no single test that provides such information. Pulmonary function tests can be used to calculate the "predicted postoperative" function, and several algorithmic approaches have been devised to predict surgical risk. Assessments of regional pulmonary function are obtained with quantitative perfusion scintiscans. Cardiac function is also an important factor.
