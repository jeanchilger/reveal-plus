Toward accurate attenuation correction in SPECT without transmission measurements. The current trend in attenuation correction for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is to measure and reconstruct the attenuation coefficient map using a transmission scan, performed either sequentially or simultaneously with the emission scan. This approach requires dedicated hardware and increases the cost (and in some cases the scanning time) required to produce a clinical SPECT image. Furthermore, if short focal-length fan-beam collimators are used for transmission imaging, the projection data may be truncated, leading to errors in the attenuation coefficient map. Our goal is to obtain information about the attenuation distribution from only the measured emission data by exploiting the fact that only certain attenuation distributions are consistent with a given emission dataset. Ultimately this consistency information will either be used directly to compensate for attenuation or combined with the incomplete information from fan-beam transmission measurements to produce a more accurate attenuation coefficient map. In this manuscript the consistency conditions (which relate the measured SPECT data to the sinogram of the attenuation distribution) are used to find the uniform elliptical attenuation object which is most consistent with the measured emission data. This object is then used for attenuation correction during the reconstruction of the emission data. The method is tested using both simulated and experimentally acquired data from uniformly and nonuniformly attenuating objects. The results show that, for uniform elliptical attenuators, the consistency conditions of the SPECT data can be used to produce an accurate estimate of the attenuation map without performing any transmission measurements. The results also show that, in certain circumstances, the consistency conditions can prove useful for attenuation compensation with nonuniform attenuators.
