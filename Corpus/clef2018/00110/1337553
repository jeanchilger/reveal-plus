Clinical comparative study of azithromycin versus erythromycin in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in children. The efficacy and tolerability of azithromycin and erythromycin in the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections in children were compared in an open, multicenter, randomized trial. A total of 151 children, aged from 2 months to 14 years, suffering from upper airways infections (60), or lower respiratory tract infections (91), were randomized to be treated either with azithromycin, 10 mg/Kg/day per os once daily for 3 or 10 mg/Kg/day 1 and 5 mg/Kg/days 2-5 (77 patients) or with erythromycin, 50 mg/Kg/day thrice daily for at least 7 days (74 patients). The two treatment groups did not significantly differ as to sex, age, weight, type and severity of infection, and infecting pathogens. Clinical evaluation was performed prior to therapy, on treatment days 1, 3, 5 and 7, and on day 10. Microbiological and laboratory assessment were carried out at baseline and after the end of therapeutic course. Chest X-ray and serologic assays for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection were obtained in patients suspected to have lower respiratory tract infections. At the end of therapy, clinical cure was achieved in 73 out of 77 patients (94.8%) in the azithromycin group, and in 60/72 evaluable subjects (83.3%) in the erythromycin group. A significantly more rapid remission of several illness-related signs and symptoms was observed in patients treated with azithromycin. A total of 75 bacterial pathogens were isolated at baseline microbiological examination at the end of the therapeutic course bacteriological eradication was obtained in 34/34 cases (100%) treated with azithromycin, and in 40/41 children (97.5%) treated with erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
