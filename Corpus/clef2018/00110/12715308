Rhinovirus infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with pneumonia. Little is known about the impact of human rhinovirus (HRV) and coronavirus infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. We tested bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from HSCT recipients with acute pulmonary infiltrates for HRV (n=122) and coronavirus (n=46) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. HRV RNA was detected in 6 (8%) of 77 patients, and coronavirus RNA was detected in 0 of 46 of BAL samples from HSCT recipients. The fatality rate in HRV-infected patients was high (83%), but all patients had significant coinfections, and the overall mortality rate was not different from that of patients who were negative for HRV in BAL samples. These results suggest that HRV may be a cause of lower respiratory tract infections in HSCT recipients and that its detection in BAL samples is associated with frequent copathogens. Whether the poor prognosis is due to HRV or the copathogen is not clear.
