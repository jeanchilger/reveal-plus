Construction workers, students and retired people ranked top three in all the occupation categories. Three peaks appeared in the dates of exclusion, and the most obvious one was from June 7 to June 13. There were two peaks in the distribution of time period from onset to exclusion, one was six to ten days and the other was forty-eight to fifty-two days after onset. Patients with history of close contact were more likely to be excluded within fifty days after onset than those without close history of contact.
