Community-acquired pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common form of severe infectious disease in developed countries. The mortality is particularly high in elderly patients. For risk stratification simple clinical scores such as the CRB-65 (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age over 65 years) are recommended. The spectrum of pathogens is characterized by Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae as well as atypical and viral pathogens. Resistance plays a subordinate role in Germany. In addition to the clinical symptoms an X-ray examination is also helpful to confirm the diagnosis and biomarkers can also be useful. Microbiological investigations are not necessary in practice. Particularly in cases of uncharacteristic clinical symptoms and therapy failure there are many differential diagnoses which can be hidden behind the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. The calculated treatment of CAP should correspond to the current recommendations in national guidelines. The options for prevention by general measures and vaccinations should be applied consistently.
