Community-acquired pneumonia--implementation of a prediction rule to guide selection of patients for outpatient treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of outpatient treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) when a prediction rule was followed by emergency physicians to guide the selection of patients. This was a prospective observational study conducted at the emergency department of a university-affiliated hospital in Hong Kong, China. A clinical prediction rule was implemented to guide the selection of patients with CAP for outpatient treatment. All subsequent hospitalizations gial presentation were recorded, and the reasons were assessed. The utilization of the observation unit was incorporated into the treatment algorithm. Of 72 patients with CAP followed up as outpatients, 60 (83.3%) were treated successfully, nine (12.5%) required subsequent hospitalization within 30 days, and three (4.2%) were lost to follow-up. None of the patients died, and none required admission to the intensive care unit. Factors associated with subsequent hospitalization include: tuberculosis, underlying malignancy, persistent fever, comorbidity (rheumatoid arthritis and severe osteoporosis), intravenous drug addiction and alcoholism. The observation ward was utilized in 10 (16.7%) patients successfully treated as outpatients. It is concluded that the prediction rule can be safely implemented as a guide for emergency physicians. The short-stay observation unit may be usefully employed for treating low-risk CAP.
