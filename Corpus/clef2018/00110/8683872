Urgent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation using a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide anti-human thymocytes rabbit globulin in a patient with severe aplastic anemia with pneumonia. A 16-year-old girl was diagnosed as having severe aplastic anemia (SAA) had received emergency complicated by sever pneumonia. She had an HLA-identical younger brother and been urgently transplantation with her brother's marrow following a preparative regimen of CY+rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Granulocyte transfusions carried out before and after the transplant prevented exacerbation of the pneumonia. The pneumonia was cured in association with the hematopoietic recovery after BMT. No signs or symptoms of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease were recognized and her hematological data are normal. The rabbit ATG was thought to be effective in preventing rejection and could be used in the preparative regimen instead of total body irradiation.
