Pneumonia in pediatric outpatients: cause and clinical manifestations. The cause and clinical manifestations of pneumonia were studied in 98 pediatric outpatients. A viral diagnosis was established in 38 (39%) of the 98 patients, and a bacterial diagnosis in 19 (19%). Ten (53%) of the 19 patients with bacterial pneumonia had a concurrent viral infection. No clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings that would reliably differentiate viral from bacterial infection were identified. This study suggests that bacterial pneumonia is more common in pediatric outpatients than previously reported, and that the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings in patients with bacterial infection may be indistinguishable from findings in patients with viral infection.
