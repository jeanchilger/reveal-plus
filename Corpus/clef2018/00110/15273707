Reduced-intensity conditioning prior to allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells: the need for T cells early after transplantation to induce a graft-versus-lymphoma effect. In patients with poor-risk relapse of aggressive lymphoma, reduced-intensity conditioning followed by allogeneic PBSCT may have its limitations because of rapid regrowth of the tumor. We tried to address this problem by intermediate-intensity conditioning followed by allogeneic SCT. A total of 21 patients received fludarabine, busulfan and cyclophosphamide prior to allogeneic SCT. In the first 10 patients, GVHD prophylaxis by CD34+ selection of the grafts was employed (group I). The next 11 patients received nonmanipulated grafts and mycophenolat mofetil plus cyclosporinA (group II). In group I, no GVHD was observed. In contrast, patients in group II had a significant risk of acute GVHD (aGVHD) (six patients with grade II-IV acute GVHD). However, in group I, all surviving patients progressed within 9 months. In contrast, eight of nine surviving patients of group II remain in remission after a median observation time of 10.5 months (range 4-22 months). Survival differed significantly between the groups (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis identified intensive GVHD prophylaxis as important risk factor for survival. These results support the existence of a clinically relevant GVL effect in aggressive lymphoma. T-cell depletion (or CD34 selection) of grafts is not recommended in patients with poor-risk aggressive NHL.
