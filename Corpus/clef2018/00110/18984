Antibiotic sensitivity of the bacterial microflora from the sputum of children with acute pneumonia. Bacteriological analysis of sputum of 598 children with acute pneumonia was performed. Sensivity of 1348 cultures belonging to 8 bacterial species with respect to benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, erythromycin, oleandomycin, neomycin and monomycin was determined. It was shown that the sputum microflora was often resistant to the antibiotics widely used in the medical practice for prolonged periods of time, such as benzylpenicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines. However, it usually remained sunsitive to neomycin, monomycin, erythromycin and oleandomycin. It was found that antibioticogrammes defining the antibiotic choice were of great significance for therapy of acute pneumonia.
