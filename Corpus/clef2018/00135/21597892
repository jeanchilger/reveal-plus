Immunological diseases of the pancreatico-hepatobiliary system: update on etiopathogenesis and cross-sectional imaging findings. Immunological diseases of the hepatobiliary system and the pancreas include a broad spectrum of disorders that manifest characteristic histopathology/serology and variable clinical features and imaging findings. Recent studies have thrown fresh light on the complex role of genetics and autoimmunity in the pathogenesis and natural history of these diverse disorders that include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, IgG4-related cholangitis, overlap/outlier syndromes, and autoimmune pancreatitis.
