Xanthogranulomatous inflammation of the peripancreatic region mimicking pancreatic cystic neoplasm. Xanthogranulomatous inflammation (XGI) is histopathologically characterized by a marked proliferative fibrosis, parenchymal destruction, and infiltration of foamy histiocytes intermixed with other inflammatory cells. Herein, we report a case of a 73-year-old man without symptoms who was initially diagnosed with a pancreatic cystic tumor but later with XGI in the peripancreatic region. Although XGI has been reported to occur in various organs or tissues, such as the gallbladder, kidney, bone, stomach, colon, appendix, lymph nodes, and soft tissues, XGI involving the pancreas or its surrounding tissues is extremely rare. When a pancreatic cystic lesion does not have typical clinicoradiological features of common pancreatic cystic neoplasms, this pathologic condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
