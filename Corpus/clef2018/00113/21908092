Pandoraea sputorum colonization in a patient with cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease produced by a defect in the transmembrane conductance regulator protein, CFTR. Currently, the morbidity and mortality associated with CF are fundamentally related with the lung affectation that is a consequence of this defect. With the progression of the disease, there is an increase in the isolation of non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli colonizing these patients. The genus Pandoraea arises from a reclassification of species included within the "Burkholderia cepacia complex". It is made up of 9 species susceptible only to tetracycline, imipenem and cotrimoxazole. We report the first clinical case in Spain of colonization by Pandoraea sputorum in a patient diagnosed with CF at the age of eleven. After several previous colonizations by different Pseudomonas species in September 2005, a gram-negative bacillus was isolated in sputum, which was identified by sequencing and mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS) as P. sputorum, only sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam, cotrimoxazole and imipenem. From 2005 to 2008, chronic colonization by this microorganism was associated with deterioration in lung function that was recuperated after treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. In 2010, this microorganism was once again isolated and treated with imipenem, to which the patient responded favorably. Currently, it is not known whether this microorganism is a chronic colonizer, whether it produces a transitory infection or whether it constitutes an important problem in CF patients, but given its special characteristics of sensitivity to anti-microbial drugs, the correct identification of this genus is essential. Mass spectrometry seems to be a valid technique that is faster than sequencing methods for identifying these species.
