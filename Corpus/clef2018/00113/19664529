Pathogenesis of neurologic manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been associated with various neurologic manifestations, but exactly how the organism can cause such a wide variety of diseases is a long-standing mystery. In this respect, although pneumonia has been considered the hallmark of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, emerging accumulations of data have revealed that the infection can cause a number of extrapulmonary manifestations even in the absence of pneumonia. The importance of host immune response in the pathomechanism of pneumonia has been established, but the pathomechanisms of extrapulmonary manifestations remain largely unknown. For this review, extrapulmonary manifestations due to M. pneumoniae infection were classified into three categories: a direct type, in which locally induced cytokines must play a role an indirect type, in which immune modulation such as autoimmunity must play a role
