Prenatal investigation of a 45,X/46,X,r(?) karyotype in amniocytes using fluorescence in situ hybridization with an X-centromeric probe. The karyotype of cultured amniotic fluid cells obtained on the indication of advanced maternal age was shown to be a mosaic 45,X/46,X,r(?). The small size and banding pattern made it difficult to determine whether the ring was derived from and X or a Y chromosome, or even from an autosome. By using an X-centromeric probe and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we demonstrated the ring to have an X centromere. Thus, a more complete genetic counselling was possible. This confirms the usefulness of FISH in identifying and characterizing this and other chromosome rearrangements in prenatal diagnosis.
