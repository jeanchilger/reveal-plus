Manipulation of the oocyte: possible damage to the spindle apparatus. Oocytes are structured, polarized cells. For high developmental potential, it is essential that the distribution of organelles and molecules, and the function of meiotic spindles remain intact during handling of oocytes in assisted reproduction. Spindles are dynamic cell organelles. Spindle formation depends on activity of motor proteins, energy supply and temperature. Disturbances in spindle function may predispose oocytes to aneuploidy or maturation arrest. Thus, perturbation of the cytoskeletal integrity of oocytes may critically influence the fate of the embryo. Recently, enhanced polarizing microscopy has been developed for non-invasive analysis of spindle morphology in living mammalian oocytes. Chemically induced dynamic alterations have been characterized in the spindle in individual mouse oocytes and it has been shown that spindle aberrations are predictive of risks for non-disjunction. Spindle imaging identified adverse, irreversible effects of handling in living human oocytes (for instance, the extreme susceptibility of human oocytes to cooling). Also, oocyte immaturity may be detected. Selection of metaphase II oocytes and an injection site for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) that avoids spindle damage may increase the yield of euploid embryos. The detection of genetic, environmentally induced, or treatment-related defects in oocyte maturation by non-invasive spindle imaging can improve quality control and assist in the selection of morphologically normal oocytes for assisted reproduction.
