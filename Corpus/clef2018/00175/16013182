Prenatal diagnosis of triploidy. Triploidy is one of the most common chromosomal numerical aberrations, resulting usually from one out off two main mechanisms: aberrant segregation of chromosomes during meiosis or from the fertilization of one egg by two sperms. In present paper the methods of non-invasive and invasive prenatal diagnosis of triploidy in I and II trimester are described. We also report the case of triploid fetus, diagnosed by ultrasound visualisation followed by amniocenthesis and cytogenetic analysis.
