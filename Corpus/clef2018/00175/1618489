Mutation analysis and prenatal diagnosis in a Lesch-Nyhan family showing non-random X-inactivation interfering with carrier detection tests. A nonsense mutation at the CpG-site in the codon for Arg(169) in the gene for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) was identified by genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing in cultured fibroblasts from two brothers with Lesch Nyhan's syndrome. The recurrence of mutation at this CpG-site in several unrelated Lesch-Nyhan families suggests that deamination of 5-methylcytosine is a possible mechanism for mutagenesis. The level of hprt-mRNA in the fibroblasts of the patients was similar to that in healthy controls, whereas hprt-enzyme activity was not detectable. The mutation in this family was also identified in five female relatives and prenatally in a male fetus. Unexpectedly, results from hair follicle analyses and fibroblast selection studies in 8-azaguanine and 6-thioguanine medium showed a non-carrier phenotype in three of the female heterozygotes, whereas X-inactivation mosaicism was demonstrated in one heterozygote. A possible explanation for the apparent non-random X-inactivation in this family is the co-existence of the hprt mutation with an undefined X-linked lethal mutation. This observation is of practical relevance for carrier detection in other Lesch-Nyhan families.
