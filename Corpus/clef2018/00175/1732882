Results of prenatal cytogenetic screening at the Prenatal Genetic Center of the Postgraduate Medical University between 1980-1990. Evaluation of prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis by Genetic Center of Postgraduate Medical University in 1980 and 1990. Between 1980 and 1990, 1039 amniocenteses (AC), 1263 chorionic villus samples (CVS), and 30 fetal blood sampling were performed for cytogenetic reasons. The rate of chromosome abnormalities were 5.5 per cent in the first trimester CVS, 5.2 per cent in the second trimester CVS, and 3.1 per cent in AC. The Down syndrome was the most frequent abnormality (46 fetuses) and the next was the Edwards syndrome (15 cases). It was established that though the case number is fourteen times more than the beginning of this decade, this was enough only for screening women 39 or over. During this period several new methods were introduced making possible the diagnosis from 9th week of pregnancy until term. Among these methods the CVS has not only become an alternative to the AC but now it is the most frequent procedure in our laboratory. Though most pregnants are still referred for prenatal cytogenetic investigation because of their advanced age, the authors search for other risk factors which would make possible screening in younger women, too.
