Down's syndrome: nutritional intervention. Down's Syndrome patients are known to be of short stature, prone to infections, autoimmune disease, hypothyroidism, leukaemia, heart defects and later Alzheimer's disease. They tend to have older mothers, like Alzheimer's disease patients. The latter tend to have sibs with either Down's Syndrome or lymphoma/leukaemia. Evidence, looking at 28 Down's Syndrome patients, suggests that multiple food allergies, gluten-gliadin sensitivity or intolerance are causing a coeliac disease-like picture with a malabsorption state for essential vitamins, minerals and severe autoimmune disease. It is hoped that missed gluten-gliadin sensitivity or intolerance with or without coeliac disease will be considered as a cause of abnormal oogenesis and spermatogenesis resulting in trisomy 21 and other aneuploidies. The mechanism most likely is low B1 interfering with sufficient release of cAMP for normal meiosis. Alternatively exorphins and peptides from foods may suppress prostaglandin E1 synthesis, or food sensitivities may alter toxic metal absorption mechanisms, which are thought to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Adequate vitamin/mineral supplementation, especially B1, prior to conception and in the first trimester is recommended for mothers at risk for DS, especially older mothers and a gluten free diet for those with coeliac disease or gluten-gliadin sensitivity/intolerance. Hopefully this will prevent conception of a DS child, or prevent heart defects/stigmata if one is conceived. DS children should be investigated for the above and commence a food allergy free diet with relevant supplements to meet their needs as early as maximum development.
