Surface fixation method applied for the detection of antigen-antibody reactions in mixtures of sera of mothers and children with Down's syndrome. An attempt has been made to use the rapid surface fixation method for the investigation of immunological reactions in mixtures of sera from mothers and their mongoloid children. This preliminary report has been encouraging since all positive reactions were properly controlled with the serum of patients suffering from various clinical conditions but free of Down's syndrome. A water soluble substance was isolated from the urine of patients which produced positive reactions like those performed with the serum of mongoloid children.
