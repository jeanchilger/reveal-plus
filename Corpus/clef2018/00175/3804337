Prenatal diagnosis of a 46,XX,inv(12)pat/47,XX,i(Xq),inv(12)pat. A 46,XX,inv(12)pat/47,XX,i(Xq),inv(12)pat was diagnosed prenatally in a 36-year-old woman whose husband was a known carrier of a pericentric inversion of chromosome 12. The diagnosis was confirmed in fetal tissue. Terminal bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling demonstrated that in the line with 46 chromosomes one X was late replicating, while one X and the i(Xq) were late replicating in 100% of the cells with 47 chromosomes. We present the first case of this type of sex chromosome mosaicism. Genetic counseling presented difficulties since it was not possible to predict the fetal phenotype.
