Combined use of nuchal translucency, gestational age and maternal age for evaluation of the risk of trisomy 21. Despite the definition of new screening policies for fetal trisomies, based on nuchal translucency thickness (NT) or maternal serum, the prevalence of trisomy 21 remains high. We propose a strategy based on a combination of maternal age, gestational age and NT, measured at the first trimester ultrasound examination, for the assessment of risk.We present, in this paper, a characterisation of the physiological increase of fetal NT between the 10th and the 14th week of gestation, in a preliminary study of 266 echographic examinations. Next we propose a calculation of the simultaneous risk of trisomy 21 based on marginal risks for maternal age and increased NT values available in the literature.We propose to define a high-risk group associated to the NT marker by using a cut-off risk of 1/250 for the simultaneous risk. This criteria may, as well, be expressed by a pathological threshold of NT varying with maternal age and gestational age. Without questioning that women aged of 38 years or older are a high-risk group, this approach should allow an improvement of the prenatal screening for trisomy 21.
