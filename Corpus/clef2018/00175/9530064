Significance of fetal intracardiac echogenic foci in relation to trisomy 21: a prospective sonographic study of high-risk pregnant women. The aim of the study was to determine if an association exists between intracardiac echogenic foci in the second-trimester fetus and trisomy 21.Over a 2-year period, targeted fetal sonography was performed for various indications in 1593 second-trimester high-risk pregnant women. Presence or absence of echogenic foci was recorded for each fetus. Amniocentesis for karyotype analysis was performed in 901 subjects immediately after sonography. The findings of these 901 subjects formed the basis of this report.Intracardiac echogenic foci were present in the left ventricle of 24 (3%) of the 901 fetuses. Three (13%) of these 24 fetuses had trisomy 21 no chromosomal abnormalities were found in the other 21 fetuses. Karyotype analysis revealed trisomy 21 in 14 (2%) of the remaining 877 fetuses who did not exhibit intracardiac echogenic foci. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values for intracardiac echogenic foci in predicting trisomy 21 were 18%, 98%, 13%, and 98%, respectively. The association of intracardiac echogenic foci and trisomy 21 was significant (p < .009) by the two-tailed Fisher's exact test.In a high-risk obstetric population, the association between fetal intracardiac echogenic foci and trisomy 21 was statistically significant. Therefore, women carrying fetuses with intracardiac echogenic foci should be informed of the statistical association with trisomy 21.
