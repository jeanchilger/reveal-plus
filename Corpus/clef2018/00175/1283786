Prenatal detection of 45,X/46,XX/47,XXX mosaicism through amniocentesis: mosaicism confirmed in cord blood, amnion, and chorion. Sex chromosome mosaicism in amniotic fluid cells poses a serious dilemma in prenatal diagnosis. Chromosome analysis of 56 primary clones of amniocytes revealed three distinct cell lines. Nine cells (16.1 per cent) demonstrated a 45,X karyotype, 11 cells (19.6 per cent) a 47,XXX karyotype, and the remaining 36 cells (64.3 per cent) had a modal number of 46 chromosomes (46,XX). Cytogenetic evaluation of 100 cells from cord blood, amnion, and chorion following delivery confirmed this triple mosaicism. However, the distribution of the three karyotypes in the pre- and postnatal samples was not found in the same proportions. The cord blood had the most similar frequency to that of the amniotic fluid sample, while the chorion had a significantly increased frequency of 47,XXX cells (41 per cent) and a decreased frequency of 45,X cells (2 per cent). Physical examination of the infant at birth revealed no discernible phenotypic abnormalities. Parental karyotypes were normal. This case highlights the difficulty in determining whether a prenatally detected abnormality will be associated with postnatal phenotypic deviation.
