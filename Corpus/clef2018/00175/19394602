How to predict implantation? No correlation between embryonic aneuploidy and soluble human leukocyte antigen G-concentrations. To determine if soluble human leukocyte antigen-G (sHLA-G) concentrations in spent culture media may assist in identifying the normal embryo for implantation.Prospective blinded comparative study.Reproductive genetic and reproductive medicine centers.One hundred and sixteen embryos obtained from eight patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).Culture media obtained 2 days after fertilization were analyzed for sHLA-G concentrations using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. A sHLA-G concentration of >or=1.9 mIU/mL was considered a positive predictor for successful implantation. Polar bodies and blastomeres from day-3 embryos were tested by PGD for 5 to 11 chromosomes: 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, X, and Y.The results of the sHLA-G concentrations were compared with the results of the PGD analyses.We found an sHLA-G concentration >or=1.9 mIU/mL in 48% (56 out of 116) and normal PGD results in 52% (57 out of 116) of embryos. Of the embryos with normal PGD results, 46% (26 out of 57) had sHLA-G concentrations >or=1.9 mIU/mL. Among the embryos with sHLA-G >or=1.9 mIU/mL, 46% (26 out of 56) had normal PGD results, and 21% of embryos displayed both normal PGD results and sHLA-G >or=1.9 mIU/mL.No correlation between concentrations of sHLA-G in embryo culture media and PGD results of an embryo's aneuploidy were observed.
