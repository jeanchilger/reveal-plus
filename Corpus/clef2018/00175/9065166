Prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis: an updated perspective. In U.S. white populations prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis can identify > or = 60% of pregnancies in which the risk for an affected fetus is high. Such pregnancies occur when both the mother and the father carry cystic fibrosis mutations about one screened couple per 1000 falls into this category. The risk of the fetus being affected is 1 in 4. Prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis compares favorably with prenatal screening for spina bifida and Down syndrome, with a similar detection rate, a much lower false-positive rate, and greater odds of being affected, given a positive result. Intervention trials in Europe and the United States provide documentation of efficacy. Larger-scale trials should now be encouraged in the United States to gain further insight into program design and case management, as a way to determine the feasibility of cystic fibrosis screening as part of routine prenatal care.
