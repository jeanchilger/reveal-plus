Lymphangioma--prenatal and perinatal aspects--Part one. Lymphangioma or cystic hygroma is a congenital malformation of the lymphatic system which has been commonly associated with fetal aneuploidy, hydrops, structural malformations and intrauterine death. In this paper we would like to report two cases of lymphangioma diagnosed prenatally in the third trimester in the fetuses with normal karyotype, normal NT in the first trimester and without other structural anomalies and with good perinatal outcome.
