The causes and natural history of fetal ascites. The purpose of this study was to examine the natural history and differential diagnosis of ultrasound-detected, isolated fetal ascites. Retrospective review of our patient data base, from 1989 to 1993, revealed 18 patients with fetal ascites diagnosed sonographically. Fetuses presenting with generalized hydrops were excluded. One of the 18 fetuses with ascites had a chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 21), four fetuses had intrauterine infections, seven had gastrointestinal processes, two had genitourinary tract abnormalities, and four were labelled as 'idiopathic' (all four resulting in normal neonates). Seventeen of 18 fetuses survived there was one fetal demise secondary to active syphilis. One fetus with parvovirus infection required intrauterine transfusion and did well. Two infants are developmentally retarded, including one with trisomy 21 and one with microcephaly secondary to cytomegalovirus infection. Fourteen of 18 fetuses had documented in-utero resolution of the ascites. Eleven of the 18 were associated with polyhydramnios sometime during fetal life. None of the fetuses developed hydrops. In conclusion, fetal ascites can result from many different aetiologies, including gastrointestinal and genitourinary anomalies. Chromosomal abnormalities and viral aetiologies must also be considered. Fetuses who have isolated ascites can have a good outcome with resolution of the ascites antenatally.
