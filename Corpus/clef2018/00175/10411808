Second-trimester maternal serum inhibin A concentration as an early marker for preeclampsia. Maternal serum inhibin A concentration is elevated in established preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this relationship antedates the appearance of the classic signs of preeclampsia.A retrospective analysis was performed on trisomy 21 screening data from 685 women at between 15 and 19 weeks' gestation. The main outcome measures were preeclampsia and small for gestational age (<5th percentile) infants.Preeclampsia developed in 35 women (5.5%). Women with inhibin A concentration >2.0 multiples of the median were significantly more likely to acquire preeclampsia (P <.00001) and to be delivered of a small for gestational age infant (<5th percentile, P <.00001) than were women with inhibin A concentration </=2.0 multiples of the median. The odds ratios were 9.4 (95% confidence interval 4.6-19.3) for development of preeclampsia and 18.2 (95% confidence interval 6. 0-54.8) for preeclampsia necessitating delivery at <37 weeks' gestation. The association remained statistically significant for nulliparous women.Elevated maternal inhibin A concentration in the second trimester was strongly associated with a subsequent risk of preeclampsia. The potential role of second trimester inhibin A measurement in a screening strategy for preeclampsia needs to be investigated further.
