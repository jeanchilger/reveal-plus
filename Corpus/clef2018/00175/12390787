Normal pregnancy in a woman having had a child with trisomy 21 syndrome before: application of preimplantation genetic diagnosis. To study the value of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) before pregnancy for couples who are exposed to high risk of trisomy 21 syndrome in their progenies to obtain birth of healthy child by in vitro fertilization procedures.Conventional hormone replacement treatment with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ISCI) was administered for ovum fertilization. One or two cells (blastomeres) were aspirated from the preimplantation embryo that had grown to 6 to 10 cells (day 3 post fertilization) for PGD with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and 3 embryos with normal chromosome were transferred into the uterus.PGD was carried out in a total of 8 embryos with valid diagnoses in 7, of which 6 were identified as normal embryos and 1 had trisomy 21 syndrome. Pregnancy was obtained that resulted in the birth of a healthy baby.Detection of chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 21 syndrome is feasible for PGD with FISH.
