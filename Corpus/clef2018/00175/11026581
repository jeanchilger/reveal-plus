Efficacy of community-based second trimester genetic ultrasonography in detecting the chromosomally abnormal fetus. We sought to assess prospectively the efficacy of community-based genetic ultrasonography in detecting chromosomally abnormal fetuses in a high-risk population and determine independent markers of aneuploidy. Patients 18 years old and older who were between 14 and 24 weeks' gestation were included if referred for maternal age greater than 35 years, increased risk of Down syndrome or trisomy 18 by second trimester serum screen, or prior affected offspring. All women had a targeted ultrasonographic examination between April 1997 and June 1999 and were offered fetal chromosomal analysis. Markers of aneuploidy and pregnancy outcomes were recorded prospectively. The primary outcome was prenatally or postnatally detected chromosomal abnormalities. Of the 1030 fetuses seen during the study, 789 had outcome data available and constituted the study group. In this group, 694 (87.9%) ultrasonograms were normal, 73 (9.2%) had one marker present, 17 (2.2%) had two markers present, and 5 (0.6%) had three or more markers present. Fourteen of 17 (82.3%) aneuploid fetuses had an abnormal ultrasonogram (one or more markers present), including 5 of 7 (71.4%) with Down syndrome. Logistic regression showed abnormal four-chamber view, structural anomaly, and intracardiac echogenic focus to be significant aneuploidy markers. The amniocentesis rate was 334 of 1030 (32.4%), and it increased with the number of sonographic markers noted (0 = 29.9%, 1 = 60.2%, 2 = 70.6%, 3 or more = 80%). Genetic ultrasonography is highly effective in identifying chromosomally abnormal fetuses in a community-based practice.
