Histomorphological features of chorionic villi at 10-14 weeks of gestation in trisomic and chromosomally normal pregnancies. This study examines histomorphometric features in chorionic villi obtained by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 11-14 weeks of gestation from 124 ongoing pregnancies (38 with trisomy 21, 14 with trisomy 18, 11 with trisomy 13 and 61 chromosomally normal controls). In the trisomy 21 group there was an inverse relationship between fetal nuchal translucency thickness (NT) and villus diameter and number of capillaries per villus cross-section. In about half of the cases there was perivillous fibrinoid present, and the amount of this increased with gestation. Compared to the chromosomally normal group, in trisomy 18 the villus diameter was smaller and the number of capillaries per villus cross-section was reduced. In the trisomy 21 group, villi had an increased percentage of two layered trophoblast present and an increased proportion of villus capillaries with nucleated red blood cells present. In all three trisomies, but particularly in trisomies 18 and 13, both the amount of basophilic stippling of the basement membrane and the proportion of cases with stippling was increased. These results provide data on the possible mechanisms of increased fetal NT and on abnormal placental development in fetal trisomies.
