What next for preimplantation genetic screening (PGS)? Experience with blastocyst biopsy and testing for aneuploidy. Blastocysts more commonly have a normal karyotype than cleavage-stage embryos do. Moreover, blastocysts have also made a metabolic transition from catabolism and recycling of the oocyte's reserves and resources, processes that fuel the first 3 days of cleavage. Although not all blastocysts are karyotypically equal, it is still to be determined to what extent a mosaic karyotype might be a normal feature among embryos, both at the cleavage stage and the blastocyst stage--and when looking for karyotypic abnormalities by embryo biopsy might help the chance of implantation rather than harm it. It is also still impractical to look at all the chromosomes that can, through their aneuploidy, stand in the way of successful embryonic and fetal development. We report a randomized clinical trial of blastocyst biopsy followed by preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) for aneuploidy using 5-colour FISH. The trial was suspended and then terminated early when we were unable to show an advantage for PGS. If we are correct in assuming that mitotic non-disjunction is common by the stage of the blastocyst (and that it is much less ominous than meiotic non-disjunction), then further studies of effective PGS of blastocysts for aneuploidy require methods of analysis that cover all the chromosomes and can differentiate the triallelic and monoallelic states of meiotically derived aneuploidies from the biallelic state of mitotic aneuploidies.
