Plasma adiponectin concentration in early pregnancy and subsequent risk of hypertensive disorders. Adiponectin is an exclusively adipose tissue-derived protein. Low plasma adiponectin levels have been found in hypertensive men. Our objective was to evaluate whether low first-trimester plasma adiponectin values were predictive of hypertensive disorders later in pregnancy.A nested case-control study was carried out on a cohort of 1,842 pregnant women who participated in the first-trimester Down syndrome screening program 34 developed preeclampsia and 48 gestational hypertension. A control group of 82 nonhypertensive uneventful pregnancies was selected. Plasma adiponectin was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Adiponectin median concentrations in the group which subsequently became hypertensive were significantly lower than those in the control group (7.6 versus 13.0 microg/mL) (P < .001). When the 2 hypertensive subgroups were considered, the plasma adiponectin median value in the preeclampsia group was significantly lower than that in the gestational hypertension group (6.6 versus 9.3 microg/mL) (P = .01). Regression analysis showed an inverse correlation between plasma adiponectin concentrations and maternal age, gestational age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and proteinuria. Approximately 34% of hypertensive pregnancies, compared with 7% of controls (P < .001), had plasma adiponectin concentrations less than 6.4 microg/mL (mean value of lower quartile of distribution among control patients). After adjusting for maternal age, all these women experienced a 6.6-fold (95% confidence interval 2.5-17.8) increased risk of pregnancy hypertension, compared with those women who had higher concentrations.Our findings suggest a strong association between hypoadiponectinemia and the risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, especially with preeclampsia.
