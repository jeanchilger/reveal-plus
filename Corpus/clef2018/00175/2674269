Value of cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry in gynecology and obstetrics. Flow cytometry is a new technique that makes it possible to study the cell cycle and the DNA content of thousands of cells per minute. Its value in oncology is prognostic, there being a correlation between the level of DNA and mitotic activity with the power to invade tissues. After a description of the cell cycle, a review of the literature demonstrates its value in gynaecology and obstetrics. Aneuploidy and marked mitotic activity correlate well with a poor prognosis for: CIN: aneuploid lesions are less likely to regress spontaneously and are found more frequently in higher grades. This is a reason for treating aneuploid CIN. Adenocarcinoma of the endometrium: aneuploidy is the best prognostic measure when analysing cells in a multifactorial way to include the stage, the grade, the degree of myometrial invasion and the receptors. Sarcoma of the uterus: in a small series aneuploidy occurred frequently and was of poor prognosis. Molar pregnancy: flow cytometry is a diagnostic aid because the hydatidiform mole is diploid with a marked degree of mitotic activity. The prognostic value has still to be determined. Ovary: borderline tumours are always diploid. In cancers of the ovary aneuploidy is a sign of aggression and predictive of survival.
