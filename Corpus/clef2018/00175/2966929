Expression of chromosome 21 specific sequences in normal and Down's syndrome tissues. Using RNA isolated from age and sex matched normal and Down's Syndrome foetal liver and brain tissues, Northern blots were prepared and probed with 4 chromosome 21 specific sequences. The results show that no consistent pattern of expression emerges when Down's Syndrome tissue is compared with normal tissue but the results are very different from the 3/2 ratio of expression which may be expected. Two sequences 21.3 and 26C show only minor differences in expression in trisomy 21 liver samples but significant changes in their expression pattern when normal and Down's Syndrome brain samples are compared. The other sequences, JG77 and JG90 show a 5 fold higher degree of expression in Down's brain but when liver samples are compared one of these sequences shows equal levels of expression in normal and Down's Syndrome samples and the other shows a decrease in expression level in Down's Syndrome samples.
