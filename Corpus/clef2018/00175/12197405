Prevalence of thyroid gland disorders in pregnant women in the West Bohemia Region during their 2nd trimester of pregnancy in the year 2000--pilot study. The diagnostics and the treatment of the disorders of the thyroid gland in pregnancy belong to the most important topics for most endocrinologists in the whole world. Untreated or mistreated thyroid gland disorders may influence the course of pregnancy and development of the foetus and child. Autoimmune thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism represent the most common thyreopaties in pregnancy and that is why the aim of the study was to establish their prevalence in population of pregnant women of the West Bohemia region. In our study we assessed serum levels of thyrotropin (TSH), free tyroxin (fT4) and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (antiTPO) in 650 pregnant women. Sera were acquired during routine blood sampling for Down syndrome screening in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy. In our group we found the prevalence of 1.5% of hypothyroidism and 9.4% of autoimmune thyroiditis and we revealed no case of thyrotoxicosis, only subnormal TSH in 2.3%.
