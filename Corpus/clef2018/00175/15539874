Prenatal diagnosis of common aneuploidies using multiplex quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction. Prenatal diagnosis of foetal trisomies is usually performed by cytogenetic analysis. This requires lengthy laboratory procedures and it is expensive. Here, we report a retrospective study of quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) for prenatal detection of trisomies 13, 18 and 21.QF-PCR was performed on a total of 447 amniotic fluids blindly analysed without any knowledge of the cytogenetic results and 43 samples with known karyotype. All samples were tested with at least 4 small tandem repeat markers specific for each chromosome 13, 18 or 21.QF-PCR results on amniotic fluid were consistent with conventional cytogenetic data. QF-PCR detected 5 cases of trisomy 21, 2 cases of trisomy 18, 1 case of trisomy 13 and 1 case with Klinefelter's syndrome.QF-PCR has proved to be very useful in clinical settings, since it allows the detection of major numerical disorders in a few hours after sampling and thus reduces parental anxiety.
