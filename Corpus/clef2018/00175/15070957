Inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone, but not testosterone levels, are normal in infants with nonmosaic Klinefelter syndrome. Klinefelter syndrome is a major cause of infertility in the male. Nevertheless, pregnancies were recently obtained by intracytoplasmic injection of sperm retrieved by surgery or ejaculation, underscoring the need to understand the role of Sertoli and Leydig cell secretions during development. In 18 infants with prenatally diagnosed homogenous 47,XXY karyotype, blood samples were taken from birth to 3 yr of age. Inhibin B (INHB), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), testosterone, FSH, and LH levels were compared with those in six adolescents with XXY karyotype and reference values established in 215 control infants. In XXY infants FSH, LH, INHB, and AMH did not differ from controls. Testosterone levels during the first trimester exhibited a physiological increase but were lower than in controls (P = 0.0001). Significant correlations were found between testosterone and LH (P < 0001), between INHB and FSH (P = 0.0011), and between AMH and INHB (P = 0.025). In XXY adolescents, AMH and INHB were undetectable. Our findings demonstrate that testosterone secretion is impaired in infants with Klinefelter syndrome. By contrast, INHB and AMH secretions were not altered, which raises the question of the mechanism(s) governing the decline of Sertoli cell function after puberty.
