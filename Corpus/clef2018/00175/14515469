Molecular cytogenetic characteristics of chromosome imbalance in cells of spontaneous human abortion fetuses with low proliferative activity in vitro. Karyotyping of noncultivated cells of 60 first-trimester spontaneous abortions (blighted ova and missed abortions) was carried out using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with centromere-specific DNA probes for all chromosomes of the karyotype. Conventional cytogenetic study of these abortions was impossible because of cell culture failures. The algorithm is proposed for molecular cytogenetic FISH analysis of interphase karyotypes. Chromosome abnormalities were found in 32 fetuses (53.3%). In groups of missed abortions and blighted ova, the frequency of numerical chromosome abnormalities was 50 and 60%, respectively. Both the numerical chromosome abnormalities typical of spontaneous human abortions (autosomal trisomies, sex chromosome aneuploidy, and polyploidy) and a relatively rare type of genomic imbalance unidentifiable by standard cytogenetic analysis (autosomal monosomies 7, 15, 21, and 22 in mosaic state) were observed. The frequency of these type of chromosome abnormalities comprised 19% of all known karyotype abnormalities determined in spontaneously perished embryos. Note that the level of confined placental mosaicism in embryos with low cell proliferative activity was 25%, which is substantially higher than the corresponding parameter (1-2%) determined by prenatal diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities in developing embryos. The results of interphase FISH analysis of cells with low proliferative activity in vitro suggest that the pathology of early fetal development and missed abortion in humans are associated with a wider spectrum of chromosome abnormalities.
