The results of aneuploidy screening in 276 couples undergoing assisted reproductive techniques. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening (PGD-AS) using sequential in situ hybridization was applied for aneuploidy testing in 276 couples with 282 ART cycles. Patients with advanced maternal age (AMA, n = 147), recurrent implantation failure (RIF, n = 48), repeated early spontaneous abortion (RSA, n = 32) and abnormal gamete cell morphology (AGCM, n = 55) including macrocephal sperm forms or cytoplasmic granular oocytes were included. Embryo biopsy was performed on day 3 in a calcium-magnesium-free medium by using a noncontact diode laser system. After fixation and enzymatic treatment, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out on 1147 blastomeres with specific probes for chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21 and 22 for AMA group, 13, 18, 21, X and Y for AGCM group and 13, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y for RIF and RSA groups respectively. The overall chromosomal abnormality rate in analyzed embryos was 40.9%, with no significant difference between AMA, RIF and RSA groups (p > 0.05). However, AGCM group presented a higher rate of chromosomal aneuploidies (57.4%) than the other three groups (p < 0.01). A total of 84% biopsied embryos presented cleavage in 24 h and embryo transfer was realized in 278 cycles. In four cycles, no chromosomally normal embryo was found for embryo transfer. A total of 88 pregnancies (31.6%) were achieved, 19.3% resulted in abortion and 63 healthy births were obtained, with a total of 93 babies born. Aneuploidy testing in couples with poor prognosis undergoing ART cycles is a useful tool to increase the chance of ART success. Furthermore, abnormal gamete cell morphology should be considered one of the major indications for PGD in ART programs as high aneuploidy rates were observed in this group.
