Prenatal detection of chromosome aneuploidy by quantitative fluorescence PCR. Autosomal chromosome aneuploid pregnancies that survive to term, namely, trisomies 13, 18, and 21, account for 89% of chromosome abnormalities with a severe phenotype. They are normally detected by full karyotype analysis of cultured cells. The average reporting time for a prenatal karyotype analysis is approximately 14 days, and in recent years, there has been increasing demand for more rapid prenatal results with respect to the common chromosome aneuploidies, to relieve maternal anxiety and facilitate options in pregnancy. The rapid tests that have been developed negate the requirement for cultured cells, instead directly testing cells from the amniotic fluid or chorionic villus sample, with the aim of generating results within 48 h of sample receipt. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization is the method of choice in some genetic laboratories, usually because the expertise and equipment are readily available. However, a quantitative fluorescence (QF)-PCR-based approach is more suited to a high-throughput diagnostic service. This approach has been investigated in a small number of pilot studies and reported as a clinical diagnostic service in many studies. It may be used as a stand-alone test or as an adjunct test to full karyotype analysis, which subsequently confirms the rapid result and scans for other chromosome abnormalities not detected by the QF-PCR assay.
