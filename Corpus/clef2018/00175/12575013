Tetrasomy 12p--unusual presentation in CVS. CVS direct preparations usually achieve limited resolution and are better at detecting numerical rather than structural abnormalities. A CVS direct preparation analyzed using G-banding revealed a 47,XY,+G karyotype in 5 of 11 cells and was reported as mosaic for trisomy 21. Subsequent analysis of the CVS culture found only normal male cells. Amniocentesis revealed both normal male cells and cells with an extra F-group chromosome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified this chromosome to be an isochromosome from the short arm of chromosome 12 [i(12)(p10)]. The amniocyte karyotype was reported as 47,XY,+i(12)(p10)[12]/46,XY[8].ish i(12)(p10)(wcp12+), which is associated with Pallister-Killian syndrome. Reexamination of the CVS direct preparation by FISH with a chromosome 12 centromere probe confirmed the karyotype of this tissue to be 47,XY,+mar[5]/46,XY[6].nuc ish 12cen(D12Z3 x 3)/12cen(D12Z3 x 2). Thus, multiple studies, including amniocentesis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, may be required to fully and accurately evaluate abnormalities detected by CVS. This case also indicates that mosaicism for supernumerary isochromosomes may have a complex origin.
