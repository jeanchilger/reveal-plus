Influence of obstetricians' attitudes on their use of prenatal diagnosis for the detection of Down's syndrome. Practising obstetricians were surveyed to determine the relation between their referral patterns and their knowledge and attitudes concerning prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis for women aged 35 years and over. Although 82% had referred at least one eligible patient for prenatal diagnosis during the past year, almost none had used the available services for all appropriate patients. There was a statistically significant trend for increased referral as correct knowledge of the risks and accuracy of prenatal diagnosis increased. Moreover, a discriminant function combining risk and accuracy estimates, type and size of practice, and language distinguished the referrers from the nonreferrers (P = 0.0002), although there was considerable overlap between the physicians classified according to a high, moderate or low rate of referral. The data suggest that while knowledge and practice characteristics can distinguish obstetricians who refer patients for prenatal diagnosis from those who never do so, the frequency of referral may involve other factors, such as how physicians accept innovation and perceive risks.
