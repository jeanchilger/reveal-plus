Prenatal diagnosis of mosaic trisomy 9. Mosaic trisomy 9 was detected in an amniotic fluid cell culture from a 40-year-old woman evaluated because of advanced maternal age. After counselling, parents elected to terminate the pregnancy. On autopsy the fetus was found to have hydrocephalus and a single kidney. The diagnosis of trisomy 9 mosaicism was confirmed in cultured skin fibroblasts. This is the third reported case of trisomy 9 mosaicism diagnosed prenatally.
