The role of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotrophin and oestriol in the antenatal screening of Down's syndrome. The use of maternal age alone to identify pregnant mothers at risk of a fetus with Down's syndrome has recently been supplemented by maternal serum screening using biochemical markers such as alpha-protein, human chorionic gonadotrophin and oestriol. These tests have been reported to increase the sensitivity of antenatal detection of such fetuses from 35% to 67% with a false positive rate of 5%. However, these maternal serum markers may be affected by maternal weight, the smoking history of mothers and diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, such sensitivities are achieved only when gestational age is assessed accurately by ultrasound. Many further studies need to be carried out before the introduction of maternal serum screening into routine obstetric practice in Singapore. These include studies on the incidence of Down's syndrome in the local population, studies on the distribution of these serum markers in the second trimester of pregnancy, sensitivities and positive predictive values of such a test in the local population as well as the socio-economic implications of implementing such a screening test in the local obstetric population.
