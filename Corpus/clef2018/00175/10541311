Intrauterine growth retardation associated with maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 6 unmasked by congenital adrenal hyperplasia. We report the first case of maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 6 (UPD6mat) ascertained through congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which arose because of reduction to homozygosity of an autosomal recessive mutation. This case suggests that UPD6mat is associated with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). A case of paternal UPD (involving only the short arm of chromosome 6) ascertained as CAH has previously been reported, but was not stated to have IUGR. Our patient was born with IUGR followed by extraordinarily good catch-up growth. She had a history of a marked lag in motor development. She presented at 2.65 y of age with pubarche of 3 mo duration, clitoral enlargement, and an advanced bone age. Simple virilizing CAH was diagnosed by elevations of plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone and testosterone. Mutation analysis showed that the CAH was due to homozygosity for the 1172N exon 4 mutation. When parental DNA was examined, the mother was found to be heterozygous for the uncommon exon 4 mutation, while the father had no detectable mutations. DNA microsatellite analysis was subsequently performed on the patient and parents using polymorphic markers spanning the entire chromosome 6. Seven markers were informative for inheritance of a single maternal allele and absence of paternal alleles in the proband. Analysis of microsatellite markers from other chromosomes confirmed biparental inheritance at these loci. This combination of findings is diagnostic of UPD6mat. The only other reported case of UPD6mat was discovered serendipitously when genotyped for renal transplantation this patient had a history of IUGR. Since both cases of UPD6mat had IUGR, the phenotype appears to include IUGR as well as the potential to unmask an autosomal recessive trait.
