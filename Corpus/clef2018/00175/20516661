Amniotic fluid prolidase activity and oxidative status in neural tube defects. To evaluate oxidative stress markers and prolidase activity in the amniotic fluid of fetuses with a neural tube defect (NTD) compared to the amniotic fluid of normal fetuses.Amniotic fluid samples from 36 pregnancies of fetuses with NTD were compared with the amniotic fluid from 36 pregnancies of genetically normal fetuses for analysis of oxidative status and prolidase activity. The control group consisted of fetuses from pregnancies that were diagnosed as high-risk according to a 1st or 2nd trimester aneuploidy screening, but which were later confirmed to have normal results. An automated method was used to measure oxidative status. Prolidase enzyme activity was determined using a photometric method.Prolidase activity, total oxidant status and oxidative stress index of amniotic fluid from fetuses with NTD were significantly higher compared to controls (p < 0.001, p = 0.003 and p = 0.002, respectively), whereas total antioxidant capacity was significantly lower (p < 0.001).Levels of prolidase activity and oxidative stress are increased in the amniotic fluid of fetuses with NTD. These indicators may serve as diagnostic markers in this disease.
