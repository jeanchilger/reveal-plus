Trisomy 12/monosomy X/normal female mosaicism: prenatal detection and confirmation in a liveborn. We report a case of mosaicism for three cell lines: 45,X, 46,XX, and 47,XX, + 12, diagnosed prenatally by amniocentesis done for advanced maternal age. Cord blood from the baby showed mosaicism for 45,X and 46,XX cultures derived from multiple placental sites, villi, cord, membrane, and skin had varying proportions of all three cell lines. The patient at 18 months of age has mild physical dysmorphisms, hypotonia, delay in gross motor development, and age-appropriate cognitive development. The literature reveals variable outcomes for individuals with either mosaic trisomy 12 or mosaic Turner syndrome. Parental origin of the chromosome involved in a proposed corrected trisomy and/or the percentage of cell types in affected organs might account for the variability in outcomes seen.
