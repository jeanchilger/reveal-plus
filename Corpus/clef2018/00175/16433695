Quantification of all fetal nucleated cells in maternal blood in different cases of aneuploidies. We quantified all fetal nucleated cells (FNCs) per unit volume of maternal blood in different aneuploid pregnancies using molecular cytogenetic techniques. Seven cases of male trisomy 18, two triploidies (69,XXX), two 47,XXX, one 47,XXY, one 47,XYY, one male trisomy 13, and one case of 47,XY,r(22),+r(22) were analyzed. Whole blood samples were obtained from 15 women between 17 and 29 gestational weeks and harvested without using fetal cell enrichment procedures. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and primed in situ labeling were performed to identify the FNCs. All slides were manually scanned to quantify those cells. We have identified 4-20 FNCs/ml of maternal blood in the cases of trisomy 18 10 and 25 FNCs/ml in the two cases of triploidy
