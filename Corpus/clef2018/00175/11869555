The establishment of a human pancreatic mixed ductal-endocrine carcinoma cell line. Establishment of a human pancreatic mixed ductal-endocrine carcinoma cell line.A specimen of this type of cancer was obtained from a male patient at the head of pancreas. The tumor tissue was minced into pieces and inoculated subcutaneously in nude mice. With two successive subcutaneous implants, a piece of tumor tissue taken from the 2(nd) implanted neoplasm of a nude mouse was minced into minute tissue masses and inoculated in a media containing 10% fetal bovine serum.Currently, it has been passed to the 55(th) passage. Cells of this cell line (PC-EN) kept simultaneously the morphologic patterns of a pancreatic ductal and endocrine tumor which were verified by histochemistry and immunohistochemistry assays. Some of the PC-EN cells showed presence of neuroendocrine granules by electron microscopy. The growth rate of this cell line was relatively low. Kakryotype analysis showed two cell populations with its major mode of chromosomes numbers as 48 in one, and 56 in the other. Study on K-ras gene demonstrated that PC-EN harbored a mutated codon 12. Several gastrointestinal hormones and CEA were detected in PC-EN cells and in the supra-cultured medium using radioimmunoassay.The cellular and molecular biologic characteristics of PC-EN cells illustrated that this cell line preserved the morphology of a pancreatic ductal and endocrine tumor and possessed a special growth property, chromosome karyotype, and mutation of Ki-ras gene, but also showed a biologic exocrine and endocrine functions of the pancreas. The establishment of PC-EN cell line will provide a useful model in vitro for further investigating the cellular and molecular biology of exocrine and endocrine tumors of the pancreas.
