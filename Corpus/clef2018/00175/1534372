Psychological effects of having amniocentesis: are these due to the procedure, the risk or the behaviour? The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of amniocentesis on women at risk for having a baby with Down's syndrome because of raised maternal age. Fifty-four of the study participants had amniocentesis and nine did not. At the time of the procedure, those having amniocentesis were significantly more anxious, less certain about the baby's health, and held more negative attitudes towards the baby than women who did not undergo amniocentesis. For women undergoing amniocentesis there was a positive association between perceived risk of having an abnormal baby and anxiety. After the baby's birth, women who had undergone amniocentesis held less positive attitudes to the baby and were significantly more worried about the baby's health. These results suggest that the anxiety surrounding amniocentesis is related both to the procedure and to the perceived likelihood of an abnormal result. The differences between the groups after the birth seem more likely to reflect pre-existing attitudinal differences between the two groups, than the effects of amniocentesis.
