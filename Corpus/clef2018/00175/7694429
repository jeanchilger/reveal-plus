Maternal serum screening for neural tube defects and fetal chromosome abnormalities. Second-trimester maternal serum screening is a noninvasive means of identifying pregnant women at an increased risk for various conditions including a fetus with open spina bifida, fetal Down syndrome, trisomy 18, multiple gestation, and adverse pregnancy outcome. Combinations of several different markers are available for screening. These include alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol. In this review, we discuss the benefits and limitations of the screening tests and the suggested protocols for the care of patients.
