Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A levels in maternal serum, extraembryonic coelomic and amniotic fluids in the first trimester. First trimester maternal serum levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A(PAPP-P) are reduced in women with a Down's syndrome pregnancy. We have examined the concentration of this molecule in the amniotic (AF) and extra-embryonic coelomic (EECF) fluids surrounding the developing fetus. Maternal serum levels of PAPP-A were elevated in all samples and steadily rose from a median of 480 mIU/1 at 8 weeks to a median of 6375 mIU/1 at 14 weeks gestation. Levels of PAPP-A were low in EECF and undetectable in the AF until 14 weeks gestation. This pattern of distribution is in contrast to that of most other trophoblast-associated antigens. This may reflect PAPP-A physiology and its specific production by the syncytiotrophoblast.
