New case of mosaic tetrasomy 9p with additional neurometabolic findings. Tetrasomy 9p is a rare chromosomal aberration that was described in 28 previous patients. Here we report on a newborn girl who was referred for genetic evaluation because of developmental delay, hypertonicity, microcephaly, minor anomalies, and neurometabolic findings. She had an isochromosome 9p (pter --> p10 --> pter) in 32% of blood cells. The extra chromosome was not found in amniocytes. Examination of fibroblasts from different skin biopsies also showed mosaicism in this tissue. In a first biopsy from the abdominal wall, the cells (n = 50) had a normal chromosomal complement. Further analysis of fibroblasts from the left forearm showed the isochromosome 9p in 5 out of 8 mitoses. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using a whole chromosome 9 probe, confirmed that the extra marker was 9 in origin. Molecular studies showed that the isochromosome was of maternal origin. Meiotic nondisjunction was followed by centromeric misdivision and postzygotic loss of the marker.
