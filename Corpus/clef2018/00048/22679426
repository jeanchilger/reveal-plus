Complete Response of Isolated Para-aortic Lymph Node Recurrence from Rectosigmoid Cancer Treated by Chemoradiation Therapy with Capecitabine/Oxaliplatin plus Bevacizumab: A Case Report. Para-aortic lymph node recurrence is a rare type of metastasis from colorectal cancer, and no treatment has yet been established. Here, we report on a case of isolated para-aortic lymph node metastasis from rectosigmoid cancer that showed complete response to chemoradiation therapy with capecitabine/oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab. A 58-year-old woman underwent high anterior resection for rectosigmoid cancer in 2009. Para-aortic lymph node recurrence occurred in 2011. She underwent radiation therapy (50 Gy) and 8 courses of capecitabine/oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab. Abdominal computed tomography and positron emission tomography with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose did not reveal any para-aortic lymph node recurrence after chemoradiation therapy. Hence, this case was interpreted as a complete response. No recurrence was noted 6 months after the complete response. Chemoradiation therapy with capecitabine/oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab is likely to be effective in treating patients with para-aortic lymph node recurrence.
