D(2)- and 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy in high-dose neuroleptic-treated patients. Individual schizophrenic patients are sometimes reported to benefit from unusually high doses of neuroleptics. Such patients may have poor drug penetration into the brain or ultra-rapid metabolism. Alternately, very high doses may be required to induce occupancy of 5-HT(2) receptors, which have been suggested as mediators of atypical effects. Five schizophrenic patients treated with high doses of fluphenazine decanoate (100-250 mg/wk) and adjunct medications were examined with positron emission tomography and [(11)C]raclopride to measure D(2) receptor occupancy and [(11)C]NMSP to measure 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy. All patients were rated globally as 'markedly' to 'severely' ill and had high scores on all subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia. However, according to retrospective clinical evaluation, there was improved social function and reduced distress following high-dose treatment, an effect that deteriorated after previous explorative dose reduction. Extrapyramidal symptoms were modest. D(2) receptor occupancy was very high (89-97%). 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy was also high (76-105%). Plasma concentrations of fluphenazine were 5-37 nm. No patient had a cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 genotype associated with ultra-rapid drug metabolism. The findings suggest almost complete saturation of D(2) receptors, and do not support poor drug availability in the brain as the basis of the apparent high-dose requirement. The high 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy may have contributed to the apparent clinical improvement and modest degree of EPS. However, it is likely that the treatment used also induced occupancy of other neuroreceptors.
