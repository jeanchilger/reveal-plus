Localization of the first and second somatosensory areas in the human cerebral cortex with functional MR imaging. Our objective was to map by means of a conventional mid-field (1.0 T) MR imaging system the somatosensory areas activated by unilateral tactile stimulation of the hand, with particular attention to the areas of the ipsilateral hemisphere.Single-shot echo-planar T2*-weighted imaging sequences were performed in 12 healthy volunteers to acquire 10 contiguous 7-mm-thick sections parallel to the coronal and axial planes during tactile stimulation of the hand. The stimulation paradigm consisted of brushing the subjects' palm and fingers with a rough sponge at a frequency of about 1 Hz.Stimulation provoked a signal increase (about 2% to 5%) that temporally corresponded to the stimulus in several cortical regions of both hemispheres. Contralaterally, activation foci were in the anterior parietal cortex in an area presumably corresponding to the hand representation zone of the first somatosensory cortex, in the posterior parietal cortex, and in the parietal opercular cortex forming the upper bank of the sylvian sulcus and probably corresponding to the second somatosensory cortex. Activation foci were also observed in the frontal cortex. Ipsilaterally, activated areas were in regions of the posterior parietal and opercular cortices roughly symmetrical to those activated in the contralateral hemisphere. The same activation pattern was observed in all subjects.The activated areas of the somatosensory cortex described in the present study corresponded to those reported in other studies with magnetoelectroencephalography, positron emission tomography, and higher-field functional MR imaging. An additional area of activation in the ipsilateral parietal operculum, unnoticed in other functional MR imaging studies, was also observed.
