Imaging Stroke Evolution after Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Non-human Primates. This article reviews imaging approaches applied to the study of stroke in nonhuman primates. We briefly survey the various surgical and minimally invasive experimental stroke models in nonhuman primates, followed by a summary of studies using computed tomography, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to monitor stroke from the hyperacute phase (within minutes of the onset of cerebral ischemia) to the chronic phase (1 month and beyond).
