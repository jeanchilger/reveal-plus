CT-guided conformal cryoablation for peripheral NSCLC: initial experience. To study the feasibility of CT-guided and monitored percutaneous conformal cryoablation of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer for patients who are not suitable for surgical resection.CT-guided percutaneous conformal cryoablation was performed on 46 patients with peripheral Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Patients with tumor sizes less than 3 cm in diameter were treated with double-needle clamping cryoablation, while the patients with 3-5 cm tumor sizes were treated with multiple-needle conformal cryoablation. CT was used to monitor the extent of cryoablation during the procedures. At month 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 post-procedure, enhanced CT scans and/or PET-CT scans were performed to evaluate the impact of the therapy.The average tumor CT values were 32±10 HU and -21±8 HU before and after cryoablation, respectively. The largest diameters of the lesions at month 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 post-procedure were 2.63±0.56 cm, 1.93±0.51 cm, 1.55±0.39 cm, 1.43±0.40 cm, and 1.38±0.38 cm, respectively, in patients with tumor diameter less than 3 cm, and 3.63±0.39 cm, 2.98±0.31 cm, 2.62±0.32 cm, 2.54±0.34 cm, and 2.56±0.37 cm respectively in patients with the tumor diameters between 3 and 5 cm. At the 24th month, there were 36 cases of complete response (83.7%), 7 cases of partial response (16.3%), and no cases of stable disease or progressive disease. 3 patients died due to multiple metastases.CT-guided percutaneous conformal cryoablation is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive therapeutic method for peripheral lung cancer.
