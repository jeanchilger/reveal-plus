A follow-up of integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography after curative resection of non-small-cell lung cancer in asymptomatic patients. A follow-up integrated positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), as part of a more intensive surveillance program, has been performed at around 1 year after curative resection, regardless of the patients' symptoms or findings in other tests. This study was designed to evaluate the results of this follow-up integrated PET/CT in patients treated for non-small-cell lung cancer without symptoms or abnormal findings.Between January 2003 and December 2006, this study enrolled 86 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who had no clinical or radiologic evidence of recurrence after curative resection before integrated PET/CT and underwent a follow-up integrated PET/CT around 1 year at our institution.The time from operation to the follow-up integrated PET/CT check was 13.4 +/- 4.4 months. Integrated PET/CT showed negative findings in 41 (47.7%) patients, equivocal findings in 16 (18.6%) patients, and positive findings in 29 (33.7%) patients. Twenty-seven (31.4%) patients had recurrent disease and 2 patients had extrathoracic double primary cancer. Six patients had extrathoracic recurrence without intrathoracic recurrence.A postoperative follow-up integrated PET/CT can be used for early detection of recurrence in asymptomatic patients who had had resection of non-small-cell lung cancer. Further studies are required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness or survival benefit of follow-up integrated PET/CT.
