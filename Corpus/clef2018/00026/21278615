Impact of 123I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN) SPECT on the diagnosis and management of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies: a retrospective study. To assess the impact of imaging the presynaptic dopaminergic terminal using DaTSCAN single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) on the clinical diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with possible dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), who were referred for imaging.A retrospective case note study was undertaken, involving a series of consecutive patients who had undergone DaTSCAN SPECT 12-24 months earlier.Case notes of 80 patients were reviewed. DaTSCAN imaging results were abnormal (indicating DLB) in 20 (25%) and normal (suggesting an alternative diagnosis or absence of disease) in 60 (75%) patients. Of the 20 patients with an abnormal scan, 18 had a postscan working clinical diagnosis of DLB (90%), one had diagnosis of vascular dementia (5%) and another had no recorded outcome (5%). Fifty-eight out of the 60 patients with a normal DaTSCAN image result had an alternative clinical diagnosis of DLB (95%). Consequently, DaTSCAN findings were concordant with the outcome clinical diagnosis in 76 out of the 80 (95%) cases. Subsequent to DaTSCAN SPECT, scan findings and diagnoses were discussed with patients and/or their carers in 94% of cases and subsequent treatment options discussed in 93% of cases.It would seem that DaTSCAN imaging has a marked influence on the working clinical diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with suspected DLB.
