Virtual and three-dimensional bronchoscopy with spiral and electron beam computed tomography. To compare spiral computed tomography (CT) and electron-beam CT (EBT) for 3D and virtual CT-bronchoscopy.17 patients with various disorders of the tracheobronchial system were examined using fiberoptic bronchoscopy, spiral CT and EBT. 3D images were reconstructed from CT data sets using automated segmentation based on volume-growing methods. Surface-rendered, volume-rendered, and hybrid reconstructions were visualized in real time using a data helmet.All data sets could be processed to high-quality three-dimensional (3D) and virtual reconstructions. The reduction of motion artifacts due to shorter scan times made EBT data sets better suited for automated segmentation and less susceptible to motion artifacts. 3D and virtual reconstructions did not increase the diagnostic sensitivity of CT compared to axial reconstructions alone.Shorter scan times of CT imaging yield higher-quality 3D and virtual reconstructions. Modern reconstruction techniques are valuable visualization tools for select indications and are the prerequisite for future developments in computer-aided medicine.
