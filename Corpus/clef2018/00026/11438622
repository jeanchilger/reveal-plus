On the quantification of [18F]MPPF binding to 5-HT1A receptors in the human brain. Previous studies have shown that 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2"-pyridinyl)-p-[(18)F]fluorobenzamido]ethylpiperazine ([(18)F]MPPF) binds with high selectivity to serotonin (5-HT(1A)) receptors in man. However, in these studies, the calculation of the binding potential (BP, which equals receptor density divided by equilibrium dissociation constant) used a metabolite-corrected arterial input. The aim of this study was to determine whether metabolite correction and arterial sampling are essential for the assessment of BP.Five analytic methods using full datasets obtained from 6 healthy volunteers were compared. In addition, the clinical applicability of these methods was appraised. Three methods were based on Logan analysis of the dynamic PET data using metabolite-corrected and uncorrected arterial plasma input and cerebellar input. The other 2 methods consisted of a simplified reference tissue model and standard compartmental modeling.A high correlation was found between BP calculated with Logan analysis using the metabolite-corrected plasma input (used as the reference method for this study) and Logan analysis using either the uncorrected arterial plasma input (r(2) = 0.95, slope = 0.85) or cerebellar input (r(2) = 0.98, slope = 0.91). A high correlation was also found between our reference method and the simplified reference tissue model (r(2) = 0.94, slope = 0.92). In contrast, a poor correlation was observed between our reference method and the standard compartmental model (r(2) = 0.45, slope = 1.59).These results indicate that neither metabolite analysis nor arterial sampling is necessary for clinical evaluation of BP in the human brain with [(18)F]MPPF. Both the Logan analysis method with cerebellar input and the simplified reference tissue method can be applied clinically.
