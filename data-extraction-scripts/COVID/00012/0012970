At the acid pH values the virus was released more slowly but reached a maximum titre similar to that at the higher pH values and showed only minimum reduction in infectivity up to 49 hours post inoculation. The stability of virus in tissue culture medium was shown to be directly related to pH between pH 6.0–8.0, being more stable at the acid pH values. The degree of cytopathogenicity induced in chick kidney cells following infection with IBV was directly related to the pH at which the cells were incubated, occurring earlier and more extensively in cells at the higher pH values. Cell macromolecule synthesis in chick kidney cells was inhibited following infection with IBV and was apparently due to cell damage and death.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
