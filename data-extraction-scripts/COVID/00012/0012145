AMP can be inhibited by linear pentapeptides isolated from Microcystis aeruginosa LTPNA08 (MG7XX). Porcine AMP inhibition—a model for human AMP—activity was spectrophotometrically measured by the formation of p-nitroanilide from L-leucine-p-nitroanilide substrate by AMP. AMP inhibition by MG770 exhibited comparable inhibition levels to amastatin (IC(50) values: 1.20 ± 0.1 μM and 0.98 ± 0.1 μM, respectively), while MG756 was slightly less potent (with IC(50) values of 3.26 ± 0.5 μM). Molecular modelling suggests a potential binding mode, based on the interaction with the Zn(2+) cofactor, where MG770′s extra methyl group contributes to the disturbance of the Zn(2+) cofactor complex and highlights the importance of hydrophobicity for the site.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
