The mean diameter of the viral particles was 28.7 nm, and they showed characteristic five- or six-pointed star-shaped surface configurations. The clinical disease manifested by the cat and the observed morphology of the viral particles are consistent with previous reports on astroviruses of other species.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
