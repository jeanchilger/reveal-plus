We have developed and validated an Aptima-format nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) designed specifically to detect the FI-nvCT. This NAAT has high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%) for the FI-nvCT strain, enabling further investigation of the geographic distribution, prevalence and transmission of this diagnostic-escape mutant in screening populations in Europe.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
