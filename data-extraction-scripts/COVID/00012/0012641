As of yet, there are no studies in Germany describing the difficulties experienced by GPs in patient care during epidemics/pandemics. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at identifying the problem areas in GPs’ patient care during the H1N1 and EHEC (enterohemorrhagic strain of Escherichia coli) outbreaks. With this information, recommendations for guaranteeing proper patient care during future epidemics/pandemics can be derived. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 12 qualitative, semi-structured, open guideline interviews with GPs in Hamburg and Lübeck were conducted, transcribed, and evaluated with qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Five areas in ambulatory patient care were identified in which changes are needed from the primary care perspective: provision of information for GPs, workload, financing of epidemic-related measures, organization of the practices, care of those taken ill. CONCLUSIONS: The workload of GPs in particular can and should be reduced through successful, centralized information distribution during epidemics/pandemics. The GP’s function as a coordinator should be supported and consolidated, in order to relieve the in-patient sector in cases of an epidemic/pandemic. Secured financing of epidemic-associated measures can help ensure patient care.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
