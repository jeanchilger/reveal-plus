It is critical for multicellular life and its abrogation often leads to a devastating disease. Yet, the underlying mechanistic details of glycosylation in both health and disease remain unclear. Partly, this is due to the complexity and dynamicity of glycan modifications, and the fact that not all the players are taken into account. Since late 1960s, a vast number of studies have demonstrated that glycosyltransferases typically form homomeric and heteromeric complexes with each other in yeast, plant and animal cells. To propagate their acceptance, we will summarize here accumulated data for their prevalence and potential functional importance for glycosylation focusing mainly on their mutual interactions, the protein domains mediating these interactions, and enzymatic activity changes that occur upon complex formation. Finally, we will highlight the few existing 3D structures of these enzyme complexes to pinpoint their individual nature and to emphasize that their lack is the main obstacle for more detailed understanding of how these enzyme complexes interact and function in a eukaryotic cell.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
