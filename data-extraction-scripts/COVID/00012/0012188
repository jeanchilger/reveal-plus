The most effective and economical way to protect against Sudan ebolavirus disease is prophylactic vaccination. However, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent SUDV infections. In this study, a bacterium-like particle (BLP)-based vaccine displaying the extracellular domain of the SUDV glycoprotein (eGP) was developed based on a gram-positive enhancer matrix-protein anchor (GEM-PA) surface display system. Expression of the recombinant GEM-displayed eGP (eGP-PA-GEM) was verified by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays. The SUDV BLPs (SBLPs), which were mixed with Montanide ISA 201VG plus Poly (I:C) combined adjuvant, could induce high SUDV GP-specific IgG titers of up to 1:40,960 and robust virus-neutralizing antibody titers reached 1:460. The SBLP also elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity. These data indicate that the SBLP subunit vaccine has the potential to be developed into a promising candidate vaccine against SUDV infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
