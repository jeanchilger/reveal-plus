At pH 6.5 the yield of virus was 10 fold higher than cultures held at pH 7.2 and 100 fold higher than those at pH 8.0. The adsorption, penetration and uncoating steps of the viral replicative cycle were shown to be unaffected by pH variation. Synthesis of TGEV RNA during the first 12 hours post infection was found to be unaffected by pH variation between the range 6.5–8.0. After 12 hours breakdown of this RNA appeared to occur in cultures held at pH 7.2 and 8.0 but not at pH 6.5. When incubated at 37° C for 24 hours the virus infectivity was found to be least affected by pH 6.5 but when kept at 4° C for the same length of time, the virus infectivity remained constant between pH 5.0 and pH 8.0.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
