Antisera prepared by immunization of mice with the individual viruses were tested for their ability to neutralize both the homologous immunogen and the other viruses. By a plaque reduction neutralization test, each antiserum was found to be specific for the immunizing virus; however, there was substantial cross-reactivity, indicating the viruses were closely related. By kinetic neutralization, two of the viruses tested, MHV-JHM and MHV-2, were found to be antigenically distinct. MHV-3 and MHV-A59 were found to be antigenically very similar but distinct. These data show that kinetic neutralization is a more precise method for determining the antigenic relationships between murine coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
