There is a certain class of proteins that assist the binding of the viral envelope to the target host cell and catalyzing fusion. All class I viral fusion proteins contain a highly conserved 20–25 amino-acid amphipathic peptide at the N-terminus, which is essential for fusion activity and is termed as the ‘fusion peptide’. It has been shown that insertion of fusion peptides into the host membrane and the perturbation in the membrane generated thereby is crucial for membrane fusion. Significant efforts have been given in the last couple of decades to understand the lipid-dependence of structure and function of the fusion peptide in membranes to understand the role of lipid compositions in membrane fusion. In addition, the lipid compositions further change the membrane physical properties and alter the mechanism and extent of membrane fusion. Therefore, lipid compositions modulate membrane fusion by changing membrane physical properties and altering structure of the fusion peptide.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
