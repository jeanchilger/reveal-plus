The aim of this study was to describe the molecular characteristics of the RdRP and VP1 genes of aichivirus B strains identified as the most frequent etiologic agent in a neonatal diarrhea outbreak in a high-production Brazilian dairy cattle herd. Preliminary laboratory analysis ruled out important enteropathogens (Cryptosporidium spp; Eimeria spp., E. coli F5, and bovine coronavirus). Fecal samples from diarrheic (n = 24) and asymptomatic (n = 5) calves up to 30 days old were collected for virological analysis. RT-PCR assays were performed for the detection of aichivirus B RdRP and VP1 genes and for rotavirus A VP7 and VP4 genes in fecal samples. Asymptomatic calves (control group) were negative for both viruses. Aichivirus B and rotavirus A G10P[11] genotypes were found in 54.2% (13/24) and 25% (6/24) of the diarrheic fecal samples, respectively. Aichivirus B was only identified (83.3%, 10/12) in calves up to two weeks old. Phylogenetic analysis based on the RdRP gene grouped the Brazilian strains in a new branch within the aichivirus B group. Comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the VP1 gene of Brazilian and Chinese aichivirus B strains allowed the strains identified in this study to be classified in the putative lineage 1. This is the first description of a high rate of aichivirus B detection in a diarrhea outbreak in dairy calves, and the first phylogenetic study of the VP1 gene of aichivirus B wild-type strains performed in South America.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
