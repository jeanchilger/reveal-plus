Three types of intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed. Viral particles appeared to be assembled from electron dense crescents which seemed to originate from type II intranuclear inclusion bodies. Virus accumulated in the nucleus of infected cells. It formed paracrystalline arrays in the electron dense centre of the nucleus but was dispersed in the peripheral electron translucent zone. Virus was released from the cells after rupture of the nuclear and plasma membranes. The results are compared with published data on the replication of adenoviruses in cell cultures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
