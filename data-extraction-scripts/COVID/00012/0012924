In this study, the altered genes expressions in the PBMC of convalescent SARS patients were investigated with suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). We found that genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were obviously upregulated, while mitochondria were now found to be closely connected with antiviral immunity. The identification of a viral gene, M, in SSH cDNA library shows the long-term existence of SARS-CoV in vivo. In addition, some oxidative stress sensitive genes, heat shock proteins, transcription factors, and cytokines showed remarkable elevation. Thin-section electron microscope shows increased lysosome-like granule and mitochondria in PBMC of patients. These results provide important intracellular clue for tracing host response to SARS-CoV infection and suggest a role of mitochondria in that process.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
