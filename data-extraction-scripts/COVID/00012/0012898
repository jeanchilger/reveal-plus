Twenty-four field isolates of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) from multiple states in the United States were recovered from 1994 to 2010 to determine the genetic relationships among them. The entire spike (S) gene of each TCoV isolate was amplified and sequenced. Pairwise comparisons were performed using the Clustal W program, revealing 90.0 % to 98.4 % sequence identity in the full-length S protein, 77.6 % to 96.6 % in the amino terminus of the S1 subunit (containing one hypervariable region in S1a), and 92.1 % to 99.3 % in the S2 subunit at the deduced amino acid sequence level. The conserved motifs, including two cleavage recognition sequences of the S protein, two heptad repeats, the transmembrane domain, and the Golgi retention signal were identified in all TCoV isolates. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length S gene was used to distinguish North American TCoV isolates from French TCoV isolates. Among the North American TCoV isolates, three distinct genetic groups with 100 % bootstrap support were observed. North Carolina isolates formed group I, Texas isolates formed group II, and Minnesota isolates formed Group III. The S genes of 24 TCoV isolates from the United States remained conserved because they contained predominantly synonymous substitutions. The findings of the present study suggest endemic circulation of distinct TCoV genotypes in different geographic locations.
