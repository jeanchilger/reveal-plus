The study of SDAV has been limited because there is no widely available continuous cell line for the propagation of high titers of the virus. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to compare the ability of SDAV to replicate in the permanent cell lines, LBC, of rat origin, and the mouse cell lines. L-929 and L-2. Following 2 to 6 repeated passages of SDAV in LBC cells, the virus could be readily propagated in LBC and L-2 cells, but not in L-929 cells. Similarly, SDAV adapted to replicate directly in L-2 cells could be readily propagated in LBC, but not L-929 cells. In LBC and L-2 cells, cytopathic effect (CPE), viral antigen, viral particles, and virus infectivity could be demonstrated. Titers of up to 10(8.0) infectious viral particles/0.25 ml of culture fluid were obtained at 48 hours in L-2 cells. Titers in LBC cells were one to two logs lower. When susceptible rats were inoculated with eighth passage L-2 cell-adapted virus, they developed typical lesions of SDA. Virus could be recovered from infected tissues and propagated in L-2 cells on first passage. The ability to propagate SDAV to high titers in the widely available L-2 cell line should promote the study of this virus and facilitate its comparison with other murine coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
