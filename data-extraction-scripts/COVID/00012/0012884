Both methods resulted in the same grouping data. So the grouping method based on HVR 1 could represent the grouping method based on the whole S1 gene. Taiwan isolates could not be placed within the existing groups. In order to test the correlation between genotype and serotype, a one-way neutralization test was used to compare 9 Taiwan isolates selected from different genotypes with Massachusetts (Mass) (H120) and Connecticut (Conn) standard strains. In addition, a two-way cross-neutralization test was performed in embryonated eggs with the β method (constant-virus, diluted-serum) and the reciprocal neutralization titers were calculated to give the relatedness (r) values. The results of two kinds of neutralizing tests showed that the serotypes of 9 isolates were different from Mass or Conn. Based on the r-values, 9 isolates were divided into two serotypes which were correlated with their genotypes. From pathogenicity tests, IBV Taiwan isolates could be divided into high, intermediate, and low pathogenicity according to their pathogenicity indexes. However, no relationship exists between pathotype and genotype. In conclusion, the genetic typing method based on HVR 1 can be used for typing IBV isolates.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
