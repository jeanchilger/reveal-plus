MMPs and ADAMs proteolytically cleave many substrates including extracellular matrix components but also signaling molecules and receptors. During neuroinfectious disease with associated neuroinflammation, MMPs and ADAMs regulate blood–brain barrier breakdown, bacterial invasion, neutrophil infiltration and cytokine signaling. Specific and broad-spectrum inhibitors for MMPs and ADAMs have experimentally been shown to decrease neuroinflammation and brain damage in diseases with excessive neuroinflammation as a common denominator, such as pneumococcal meningitis and multiple sclerosis, thereby improving the disease outcome. Timing of metalloproteinase inhibition appears to be critical to effectively target the cascade of pathophysiological processes leading to brain damage without inhibiting the neuroregenerative effects of metalloproteinases. As the critical role of metalloproteinases in neuronal repair mechanisms and regeneration was only lately recognized, the original idea of chronic MMP inhibition needs to be conceptually revised. Recently accumulated research urges for a second chance of metalloproteinase inhibitors, which—when correctly applied and dosed—harbor the potential to improve the outcome of different neuroinflammatory diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
