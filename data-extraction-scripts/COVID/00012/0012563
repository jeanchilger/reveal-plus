The objectives of this study were to measure (1) audited compliance of primary health-care facilities in South Africa with national standards for OHS and IPC, (2) change in compliance at reaudit three years after baseline, and (3) the inter-rater reliability of the audit. METHODS: The study analyzed audits of 60 primary health-care facilities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Baseline external audits in the time period 2011–2012 were compared with follow-up internal audits in 2014–2015. Audits at 25 facilities that had both internal and external audits conducted in 2014/2015 were used to measure reliability. RESULTS: At baseline, 25% of 60 facilities were “noncompliant” (audit score<50%), 48% “conditionally compliant” (score >50 < 80%), and only 27% “compliant” (score >80%). Overall, there was no significant improvement in compliance three years after baseline. Percentage agreement on specific items between internal and external audits ranged from 28% to 92% and kappa from -0.8 to 0.41 (poor to moderate). CONCLUSION: Low baseline compliance with OHS–IPC measures and lack of improvement over three years reflect the difficulties of quality improvement in these domains. Low inter-rater reliability of the audit instrument undermines the audit process. Evidence-based investment of effort is required if repeat auditing is to contribute to occupational risk reduction for health workers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
