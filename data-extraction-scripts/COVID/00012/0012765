<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-02-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Antibiotikatherapie in der Hals-Nasen-Ohren-Heilkunde</TITLE><BODY>First, the general principles for an antibiotic therapy are stated. The indications have to be well thought through. Frequent viral ENT infections, as well as numerous bacterial infections, should not be treated with antibiotics. Due to the current antibiotic sensitivity of the main ENT pathogens, the antibiotic choice for an empiric therapy is emphasized, and also the advantage of an optimized therapy based on the results of Gram stain (supercalculated empiric therapy) and an antibiogram (specific therapy). Pus characteristics may be the first step in diagnosing the pathogens. The degree of severity of an infection determines the oral or parenteral route of administration. As a rule, antibiotic therapy has to be checked after 2–3 days. The grouping of the different ENT infections with a similar spectrum of pathogens gives a better view of the therapeutic principles and reduces repetitions. The current recommendations for antibiotic treatment of numerous ENT infections with different degrees of severity are indicated. After the presentation of the appropriate antibiotics with their current spectrum of efficacy, the initial therapy, treatment in case of penicillin allergy, and of severe cases and complications or therapeutic failure are mentioned.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
