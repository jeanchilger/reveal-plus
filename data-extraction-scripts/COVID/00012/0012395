In this review, we discuss how pleiotropic functions of caveolin‐1 (Cav1) and its intricate roles in numerous cellular functions including lipid trafficking, signalling, cell migration and proliferation, as well as cellular senescence, infection and inflammation, are integral for normal development and functioning of skin and its appendages. We then examine how disruption of the homeostatic levels of Cav1 can lead to development of various cutaneous pathophysiologies including skin cancers, cutaneous fibroses, psoriasis, alopecia, age‐related changes in skin and aberrant wound healing and propose how levels of Cav1 may have theragnostic value in skin physiology/pathophysiology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
