Although the rational drug design traditionally uses information on known 3D structures of viral proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins (i.e., functional proteins that do not possess unique 3D structures), with their multitude of disorder-dependent functions, are crucial for the biology of viruses. Here, viruses utilize disordered regions in their invasion of the host organisms and in hijacking and repurposing of different host systems. Furthermore, the ability of viruses to efficiently adjust and accommodate to their hostile habitats is also intrinsic disorder-dependent. However, little is currently known on the level of penetrance and functional utilization of intrinsic disorder in the ALKV proteome. To fill this gap, we used here multiple computational tools to evaluate the abundance of intrinsic disorder in the ALKV genome polyprotein. We also analyzed the peculiarities of intrinsic disorder predisposition of the individual viral proteins, as well as human proteins known to be engaged in interaction with the ALKV proteins. Special attention was paid to finding a correlation between protein functionality and structural disorder. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic study of the intrinsic disorder status of ALKV proteome and interactome.
