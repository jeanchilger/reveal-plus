The sCOE–Co1 fusion gene was introduced into rice calli via the particle bombardment-mediated transformation method. The stable integration and transcriptional expression of the sCOE–Co1 fusion gene was confirmed by genomic DNA PCR amplification and Northern blot analysis, respectively. The expression of the COE–Co1 fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The highest expression level of the COE–Co1 fusion protein reached 0.083 % of the total soluble protein according to quantitative densitometry of Western blot analysis. Mice immunized with transgenic rice calli protein extracts induced significant serum IgG and fecal IgA antibody levels against purified bacterial COE. The systemic and mucosal immune responses were confirmed by measuring COE-specific IgG and IgA antibody-secreting cells in the lymphocytes extracted from the spleen and COE-specific IgA antibody-secreting cells in the Peyer’s patches from immunized mice. These results indicated that oral immunization of plant-produced COE–Co1 fusion protein could elicit efficient systemic and mucosal immune responses against the COE antigen. Key message Neutralizing epitope from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus-M cell targeting ligand fusion protein was produced in transgenic rice calli and elicited systemic and mucosal immune responses by oral administration in mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
