Despite great advances in the development of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, relapse and metastasis in NPC patients remain major causes of mortality. Evidence accumulated over recent years indicates that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic replication plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NPC and inhibition of EBV reactivation is now being considered as a goal for the therapy of EBV-associated cancers. With this in mind, a panel of dietary compounds was screened and emodin was found to have potential anti-EBV activity. Through Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analysis, we show that emodin inhibits the expression of EBV lytic proteins and blocks virion production in EBV- positive epithelial cell lines. In investigating the underlying mechanism, reporter assays indicated that emodin represses Zta promoter (Zp) and Rta promoter (Rp) activities, triggered by various inducers. Mapping of the Zp construct reveals that the SP1 binding region is important for emodin-triggered repression and emodin is shown to be able to inhibit SP1 expression, suggesting that it likely inhibits EBV reactivation by suppression of SP1 expression. Moreover, we also show that emodin inhibits the tumorigenic properties induced by repeated EBV reactivation, including micronucleus formation, cell proliferation, migration, and matrigel invasiveness. Emodin administration also represses the tumor growth in mice which is induced by EBV activation. Taken together, our results provide a potential chemopreventive agent in restricting EBV reactivation and NPC recurrence.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
