<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-06-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Nanomedicine for Treatment of Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</TITLE><BODY>Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a heterogenous group of lung disease in critically ill patients that continues to have high mortality. Despite the increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of ARDS, specific targeted treatments for ARDS have yet to be developed. ARDS represents an unmet medical need with an urgency to develop effective pharmacotherapies. Multiple promising targets have been identified that could lead to the development of potential therapies for ARDS; however, they have been limited because of difficulty with the mode of delivery, especially in critically ill patients. Nanobiotechnology is the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs. Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of agents, allowing an increase in the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs and resulting in improved efficacy with reduction in drug toxicity. Although attractive, delivering nanomedicine to lungs can be challenging as it requires sophisticated systems. Here we review the potential of novel nanomedicine approaches that may prove to be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of this devastating condition.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
