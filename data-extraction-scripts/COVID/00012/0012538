Inhibition of coiled coil-mediated interactions using bioactive peptides that replicate an α-helical chain from the viral fusion machinery has significant antiviral potential. Here, we present the construction of a series of lipopeptides composed of a de novo heptad repeat sequence-based α-helical peptide plus a hydrocarbon tail. Promisingly, the constructs adopted stable α-helical conformations and exhibited relatively broad-spectrum antiviral activities against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and influenza A viruses (IAVs). Together, these findings reveal a new strategy for relatively broad-spectrum antiviral drug discovery by relying on the tunability of the α-helical coiled-coil domains present in all class I fusion proteins and the amphiphilic nature of the individual helices from this multihelix motif.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
