<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003-05-09</DATELINE><TITLE>ICU management of severe acute respiratory syndrome</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious viral illness first recognized in late 2002. It has now been documented in 26 countries worldwide, with significant outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto. Research into identifying the etiological agent, evaluating modes of disease transmission, and treatment options is currently ongoing. DISCUSSION: The disease can produce a severe bilateral pneumonia, with progressive hypoxemia. Up to 20% of patients require mechanical ventilatory support, with a fatal outcome occurring in about 5% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: We review the current knowledge about this disease, with particular emphasis on ICU management and infection control precautions to prevent disease transmission.
