RHD, characterized by hemorrhaging, liver necrosis, and high morbidity and mortality in rabbits and hares, causes severe economic losses in the rabbit industry worldwide. Due to the lack of an efficient in-vitro propagation system for RHDV, the current vaccine is produced via chemical inactivation of crude RHDV preparation derived from the livers of infected rabbits. Inactivated vaccines are effective for controlling RHD, but the potential problems of biosafety and animal welfare have negative effects on the application of inactivated vaccines. In this study, an oral Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) vaccine was used as an antigen delivery system to express RHDV capsid protein VP60(VP1)-eGFP fusion protein. The expression of the recombinant protein was confirmed via western blotting and immunofluorescence (IFA). Our results indicate that oral administration of this probiotic vaccine can stimulate secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and IgG-based humoral immune responses in rabbits. The immunized rabbits were completely protected against challenge with RHDV. Our findings indicate that the L. casei expression system is a new strategy for the development of a safe and efficient vaccine against RHDV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
