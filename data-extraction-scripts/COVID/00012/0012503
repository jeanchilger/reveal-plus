It possesses great capability for post‐translation modification in expression of foreign proteins. With the counterselection cassette rpsL‐neo and phage λ‐Red recombinase, the defective‐rescue BmNPV BES reBmBac can be employed for efficient heterologous multigene coexpression at different gene sites in one baculovirus genome. In the present study, a recombinant baculovirus, reBm‐Cαγ, carrying two types of chicken interferon (IFN) genes (chIFN‐α and chIFN‐γ) was constructed using the reBmBac system. The chIFN‐α and chIFN‐γ genes were inserted into the same baculovirus genome at the polyhedron and p10 gene sites, respectively. The recombinant baculovirus was capable of coexpressing both chIFN‐α and chIFN‐γ. The expression levels of the two types of IFN in the coexpression product were exponentially high, at approximately 1.7 and 2.5 times higher, respectively, than those in the corresponding single‐expression products. The increase in expression level corresponds to replacement of the nonessential p10 gene in the reBm‐Cαγ recombinant baculovirus. This coexpression of recombinant chicken IFNs showed superior antiviral activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
