The cell viability changes of four bacteria species (Escherichia coli K12 JM109; Acinetobacter sp. 5A5; Pseudomonas oleovorans X5; and Staphylococcus aureus X8), three Gram-negative and one Gram-positive, in a large evaporating droplet of size 1,800 μm in diameter on teflon-coated slides were measured using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight solution and a microscope. Droplets of three levels of salinity (0, 0.9, and 36% w/v) were tested. All four species survived well during the droplet evaporation process, but died mostly at the time when droplets were dried out at 40–45 min. The final bacteria survival rate after droplets were completely dried was dependent on bacteria species and the salinity of the suspension solution. Droplet evaporation over the first 35–40 min had no adverse effect on bacterial survival for the droplets tested. The lethal effect of desiccation was found to be the most important death mechanism.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
