Angiotensin II is one key effector peptide of the RAS, inducing vasoconstriction and exerting multiple biological functions. ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a physiological and pathological role of ACE2 in the cardiovascular systems. Intriguingly, the SARS coronavirus, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), utilizes ACE2 as an essential receptor for cell fusion and in vivo infections. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that ACE2 protects murine lungs from acute lung injury as well as SARS-Spike protein-mediated lung injury, suggesting a dual role of ACE2 in SARS infections and protection from ARDS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
