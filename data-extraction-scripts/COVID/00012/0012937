Here, we present our cohort of Turkish LRBA-deficient patients from a single center, demonstrating a diversity of clinical manifestations. METHOD: Seven affected individuals from five families were assessed retrospectively in this study. RESULTS: Of the seven patients with LRBA deficiency, four had homozygous, and two had compound heterozygous mutations. One patient remained disease free until the last follow-up (age 17 years). The most common clinical manifestations of the six symptomatic patients were organomegaly (6/6), autoimmunity (6/6), and chronic diarrhea (5/6). Recurrent infectious episodes were observed in three patients. None of the patients had hypogammaglobulinemia at presentation. B cell subpopulation analysis revealed low numbers of switched-memory B cell numbers in two of the four tested patients. During the disease course, three of the patients died, two of them underwent successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from matched sibling donors, and one is under abatacept therapy. CONCLUSION: LRBA defects should always be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis for patients with autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs, chronic diarrhea, and organomegalies. In our experience, early HSCT is a life-saving therapeutic strategy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
