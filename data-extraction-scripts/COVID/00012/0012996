We evaluated whether postmortem blood and bloodstains containing hepatitis B virus (HBV) are infectious. HBV-infected blood and bloodstains were stored for up to 60 days at room temperature and subsequently screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA. In addition, HBV-positive postmortem blood was added to a cell line and the production of HBV virions was examined over a period of 7 days. HBsAg and HBV DNA were detected in all samples stored for 60 days at room temperature. HBV-positive postmortem blood successfully infected the cell line and progeny viruses were produced for up to 6 days. Thus, it is crucial that due care is taken when handling not only living material infected with HBV, as well as other harmful viruses, but also blood or body fluids from cadavers or medical waste.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
