In this study, we developed a mutant 3CL(pro) (T25G) with an expanded S1′ space that demonstrates 43.5-fold better k(cat)/K(m) compared with wild-type in cleaving substrates with a larger Met at P1′ and is suitable for tag removal from recombinant fusion proteins. Two vectors for expressing fusion proteins with the T25G recognition site (Ala-Val-Leu-Gln↓Met) in Escherichia coli and yeast were constructed. Identical cloning sites were used in these vectors for parallel cloning. PstI was chosen as a 5′ cloning site because it overlapped the nucleotide sequence encoding the protease site and avoided addition of extra amino acids at the N terminus of recombinant proteins. 3CL(pro) (T25G) was found to have a 3-fold improvement over TEV(pro) in tag cleavage at each respective preferred cleavage site.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
