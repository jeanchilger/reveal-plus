<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-05</DATELINE><TITLE>DEAD-Box Helicases: Sensors, Regulators, and Effectors for Antiviral Defense</TITLE><BODY>DEAD-box helicases are a large family of conserved RNA-binding proteins that belong to the broader group of cellular DExD/H helicases. Members of the DEAD-box helicase family have roles throughout cellular RNA metabolism from biogenesis to decay. Moreover, there is emerging evidence that cellular RNA helicases, including DEAD-box helicases, play roles in the recognition of foreign nucleic acids and the modulation of viral infection. As intracellular parasites, viruses must evade detection by innate immune sensing mechanisms and degradation by cellular machinery while also manipulating host cell processes to facilitate replication. The ability of DEAD-box helicases to recognize RNA in a sequence-independent manner, as well as the breadth of cellular functions carried out by members of this family, lead them to influence innate recognition and viral infections in multiple ways. Indeed, DEAD-box helicases have been shown to contribute to intracellular immune sensing, act as antiviral effectors, and even to be coopted by viruses to promote their replication. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these interactions, as well as the cellular roles of DEAD-box helicases themselves, is limited in many cases. We will discuss the diverse roles that members of the DEAD-box helicase family play during viral infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
