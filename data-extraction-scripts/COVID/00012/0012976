The first infective virus was detected on the cells 4 hours post infection, followed by rapid release of the virus into the culture fluids. Virus-induced syncytia in BALB/c-3T3 cell cultures caused hemadsorption at 4° C and viral antigens were shown to be located in the cytoplasm of the syncytia by immunofluorescent techniques. By scanning electron-microscopy, budding virus-like particles were detected on the surface of virus-induced syncytia. Morphologically the virus was shown to be enveloped and approximately 100 nm in diameter. Two types of projections were demonstrated, one type of projection was club-shaped, 20 nm in length and the other type was small, granular, 5 nm in length. The latter type of projection might be the basal part of the clubshaped type and related to the hemagglutinating activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
