Extensive metagenomic studies of different organs/tissues from bats have revealed a large number of novel or divergent viruses. To elucidate viral diversity and epidemiological and phylogenetic characteristics, six pooled fecal samples from bats were generated (based on bat species and geographic regions characteristic for virome analysis). These contained 500 fecal samples from six bat species, collected in four geographic regions. Metagenomic analysis revealed a plethora of divergent viruses originally found in bats. Multiple contigs from influenza A virus and coronaviruses in bats shared high identity with those from humans, suggesting possible cross-species transmission, whereas a number of contigs, whose sequences were taxonomically classifiable within Alphapapillomavirus, Betaretrovirus, Alpharetrovirus, Varicellovirus, Cyprinivirus, Chlorovirus and Cucumovirus had low identity to viruses in existing databases, which indicated possible evolution of novel viral species. None of the established caliciviruses and picornaviruses were found in the 500 fecal specimens. Papillomaviruses with high amino acid identity were found in Scotophilus kuhlii and Rhinolophus blythi, challenging the hypotheses regarding the strict host specificity and co-evolution of papillomaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that four bat rotavirus A strains might be tentative G3 strains, according to the Rotavirus Classification Working Group classification.
