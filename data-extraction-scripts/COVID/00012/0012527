The effect of cholesterol-lowering diets on inflammatory biomarkers is less well known. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a dietary combination (portfolio) of cholesterol-lowering foods vs a statin in reducing C-reactive protein (CRP) as a biomarker of inflammation linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS: In all, 34 hyperlipidemic subjects completed three 1-month treatments as outpatients in random order: a very low-saturated fat diet (control); the same diet with 20 mg lovastatin (statin); and a diet high in plant sterols (1.0 g/1000 kcal), soy protein (21.4 g/1000 kcal), viscous fibers (9.8 g/1000 kcal), and almonds (14 g/1000 kcal) (portfolio). Fasting blood samples were obtained at weeks 0, 2, and 4. RESULTS: Using the complete data, no treatment reduced serum CRP. However, when subjects with CRP levels above the 75th percentile for previously reported studies (>3.5 mg/l) were excluded, CRP was reduced similarly on both statin, −16.3±6.7% (n=23, P=0.013) and dietary portfolio, −23.8±6.9% (n=25, P=0.001) but not the control, 15.3±13.6% (n=28, P=0.907). The percentage CRP change from baseline on the portfolio treatment (n=25) was greater than the control (n=28, P=0.004) but similar to statin treatment (n=23, P=0.349). Both statin and portfolio treatments were similar in reducing CRP and numerically more effective than control but only the change in portfolio was significant after the Bonferroni adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of cholesterol-lowering foods reduced C-reactive protein to a similar extent as the starting dose of a first-generation statin.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
