Innovative surveillance methods are needed to ensure adequate and timely response to such threats. In January 2009 the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) established a system of weekly telephone conferences with all competent authorities of the German federal states to identify, discuss and respond to infectious disease events in real-time. A regular and structured platform was developed for use between participants from state level public health authorities, the military and the RKI. During the first three quarters, 46 infectious diseases were covered, including mandatory reports of measles and meningococcal meningitis and outbreaks of cowpox, which does not have to be notified in Germany. Results of a targeted evaluation and a consistently high attendance rate both indicate that the teleconference has met additional needs for supplemental information exchange among participants. The telephone conference has proven to be a useful resource for rapid and direct communication, coordination and evaluation of signals for public health events in Germany.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
