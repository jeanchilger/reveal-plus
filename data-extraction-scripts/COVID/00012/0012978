The emergence of novel PEDV strains in recent years has decreased the effectiveness of PEDV vaccines. We have developed a live recombinant vaccine, a swinepox virus vector that expresses a truncated S protein (rSPV-St) from a recent PEDV strain, SQ2014, and evaluated its immunogenicity and effectiveness in a swine model. Vaccination of swine with rSPV-St elicited a robust antibody response specific for the homologous PEDV SQ2014. Serum IgA titers in rSPV-St-vaccinated animals were significantly higher than in those immunized with inactivated vaccines. The effectiveness of antibodies induced by the rSPV-St vaccine in protection against PEDV was tested in a passive-transfer model in which piglets were challenged with the homologous virus SQ2014 and the heterologous strain CV777. When challenged with the homologous virus, sera from rSPV-St vaccination provided complete protection. However, sera from rSPV-St vaccination did not provide any protection against the heterologous virus challenge. Amino acid sequence differences in the S proteins of the two viruses were identified within neutralizing epitopes, which might have contributed to the divergent clinical results. Our data suggest that rSPV-St is potentially an effective vaccine against infection with emerging PEDV strains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
