Isoforms of sialic acid are critical determinants of virus pathogenesis. To date, the focus of viral receptor-mediated attachment has been on Neu5Ac. O-Acetylated Neu5Acs have been largely ignored as receptor determinants of virus pathogenesis, although it is ubiquitous across species. Significantly, the array of structures resulting from site-specific O-acetylation by sialic acid O-acetyltransferases (SOATs) provides a means to examine specificity of viral binding to host cells. Specifically, C(4) O-acetylated Neu5Ac can influence virus pathogenicity. However, the biological implications of only O-acetylated Neu5Ac at C(7–9) have been explored extensively. This review will highlight the biological significance, extraction methods, and synthetic modifications of C(4) O-acetylated Neu5Ac that may provide value in therapeutic developments and targets to prevent virus related diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
