<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1985</DATELINE><TITLE>Pathogenetic observations on pleural effusion disease in rabbits</TITLE><BODY>A pathogenetic study of pleural effusion disease (PED) in rabbits was made, using the virulent PED agent or virus (PEDV) and an avirulent derivate of this isolate. Independent of infective dose within the range examined, the virulent isolate caused fatal clinical disease, whereas the avirulent isolate caused subclinical infection. The two isolates differed in rapidity of initial spread of infection and in the maximum virus titres in serum, but they both resulted in a similar low level persisting viraemia. Circulating virulent virus gradually became avirulent during the viraemia. Avirulent infection induced protective immunity to virulent challenge during the first week after primary infection, but full clinical protection was not established until after the fourth week. The findings, corrobated with other closely comparable observations, suggest that the emergence of PED as an intercurrent mortality problem during rabbit passage of pathogenicTreponema pallidum is the result of a specific selective pressure on a benign passenger virus. The expression of virulence of PEDV appears to be dependent on length of interval between passages.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
