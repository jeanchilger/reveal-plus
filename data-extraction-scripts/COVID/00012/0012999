Three synthetic peptides and anE. coli recombinant fusion protein generated from FIPV 79-1146 spike gene sequence were produced. Coronavirus positive cat sera reacted to peptide aa 950–990 but were non-reactive to aa137–151 and aa 150–180 peptides as demonstrated by ELISA. Amino acid sequence 97–222 expressed as a galk fusion protein inE. coli was tested against coronavirus positive cat sera by western blot analysis. Only sera from cats exposed to the FIPV type-II strains DF-2 or 79–1146 that were exhibiting signs of FIP recognized the fusion protein. Sera from FECV exposed cats did not recognize the 97–222 fusion protein in western blot analysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
