<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-05-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Infektionskrankheiten und ihre Codierung: Was kann sich durch die ICD-11 verbessern?</TITLE><BODY>The revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) could change morbidity and mortality statistics significantly, which also affects the area of infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are classified according to their etiology, affected body system or the life period during which the episode occurs. Specific challenges arise from emerging pathogens and the respective necessary adaptation. For epidemiologic analysis ICD-10 does not always offer enough additional information. ICD provides the basis for international comparison of infectious disease morbidity and mortality statistics, but it is also used to collect data for surveillance and research purposes, e. g. the notification system for infectious diseases, syndromic surveillance systems and the evaluation of data quality by using secondary data sources. ICD-11 offers the chance to better represent epidemiological concepts of infectious diseases by adding more relevant information as affected body system or manifestation. Due to the complexity of coding, ensuring continuity of morbidity and mortality statistics could be challenging.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
