Although serological surveys show that BVDV exposure is widespread in cattle in Uruguay, BVDV-associated diseases are greatly underreported. The aim of this work is to describe the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, and virological findings from spontaneous outbreaks of BVDV-associated diseases in cattle in Uruguay. Diagnostic investigations were performed during 6 spontaneous disease outbreaks on beef and dairy cattle farms in the departments of Colonia, Rio Negro, and Soriano between November 2016 and April 2018. Carcasses of 8 naturally deceased cattle from these outbreaks were necropsied and subjected to histological examination and immunohistochemistry to detect BVDV antigen in the tissues. Reverse transcription real-time PCR and genomic sequencing were also performed to identify BVDV at the species and subtype levels. Other ancillary diagnostic tests, including bacterial cultures, were performed on a case-by-case basis to rule in/out differential diagnoses based on initial clinicopathological presumptive diagnoses. BVDV-associated conditions that were diagnosed in the 8 cases included mucosal disease, transient postnatal BVDV infections associated with digestive/septicemic salmonellosis by Salmonella serovar typhimurium, Histophilus somni bronchopneumonia, urinary tract coinfections with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sp., enteric coinfection with coccidia, and transplacental fetal infections and abortions with Neospora caninum coinfection. BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b were each identified in four of the eight cases. We conclude that BVDV-1a and BVDV-2b contribute significantly to disease and mortality in cattle in Uruguay. Future research should estimate the economic impact of BVDV in the Uruguayan livestock sector.
