Therefore, identification of EGFR mutations is essential. In the present study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was used to identify EGFR mutations, and its efficiency was compared with the Therascreen quantitative PCR assay. Using LAMP and Therascreen to analyze surgically resected tissue samples from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutations were observed in 32/59 tumor samples (LAMP) and 33/59 tumor samples (Therascreen). Notably, the LAMP assay identified one tumor as wild-type, which had previously been identified as a deletion mutation in exon 19 via the Therascreen assay (Case X). However, the direct sequencing to confirm the EGFR status of the Case X adhered to the results of the LAMP assay. Further experiments using Case X DNA identified this exon 19 deletion mutation using both methods. In addition, a novel deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR was identified. Overall, the present study shows that the LAMP method may serve as a valuable alternative for the identification oncogene mutations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
