In this study, a checkpoint blockade vaccine for canine melanoma was tested for safety and immunogenicity. Five healthy adult dogs received a mixture of three replication-defective chimpanzee-derived adenoviral vectors, one expressing mouse fibroblast-associated protein (mFAP) and the others expressing canine melanoma-associated antigens Trp-1 or Trp-2 fused into Herpes Simplex-1 glycoprotein D, a checkpoint inhibitor of herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) pathways. The vaccine mixture was shown to be well tolerated and increased frequencies of canineTrp-1-specific activated CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells secreting interferon-(IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, or interleukin (IL)-2 alone or in combinations in four and five out of five dogs, respectively. To avoid excessive bleeds, responses to cTrp-2 were not analyzed. All dogs responded with increased frequencies of mFAP-specific activated CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells. The results of this safety/immunogenicity trial invite further testing of this checkpoint blockade vaccine combination in dogs with melanoma.
