The introduction of a fluorine at the 6′-position enhanced the inhibition of SAH hydrolase and the activity against RNA viruses. The adenosine and N(6)-methyladenosine analogues 2a–e showed potent inhibition against SAH hydrolase, while only the adenosine derivatives 2a–c exhibited potent antiviral activity against all tested RNA viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, chikungunya virus, and/or Zika virus. 6′,6′-Difluoroaristeromycin (2c) showed the strongest antiviral effect for MERS-CoV, with a ∼2.5 log reduction in infectious progeny titer in viral load reduction assay. The phosphoramidate prodrug 3a also demonstrated potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity, possibly by inhibiting the viral RdRp. This study shows that 6′-fluorinated aristeromycins can serve as starting points for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents that target RNA viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
