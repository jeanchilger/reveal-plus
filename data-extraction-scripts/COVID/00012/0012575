MATERIAL & METHODS: 33 patient samples from two collections sites in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which were pre-characterized via real-time RT-PCR targeting MERS-CoV orf1a and upE, and were tested using the MERS-CoV N gene, as a confirmatory assay. This diagnostic procedure follows a two-step diagnostics scheme, recommended by the WHO. RESULTS: 18/33 samples tested positive, 11/33 tested negative for MERS-CoV RNA and 2/33 showed uncertain results. CONCLUSION: The results suggest, that the RealStar(®) MERS-CoV (N gene) RT-PCR kit 1.0 can be considered a suitable and reliable confirmatory assay in combination with the RealStar MERS-CoV RT-PCR kit 1.0 according to the diagnostic scheme recommended by WHO.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
