<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-01-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Multicolor two-photon imaging of in vivo cellular pathophysiology upon influenza virus infection using the two-photon IMPRESS</TITLE><BODY>In vivo two-photon imaging is a valuable technique for studies of viral pathogenesis and host responses to infection in vivo. In this protocol, we describe a methodology for analyzing influenza virus–infected lung in vivo by two-photon imaging microscopy. We describe the surgical procedure, how to stabilize the lung, and an approach to analyzing the data. Further, we provide a database of fluorescent dyes, antibodies, and reporter mouse lines that can be used in combination with a reporter influenza virus (Color-flu) for multicolor analysis. Setup of this model typically takes ~30 min and enables the observation of influenza virus–infected lungs for >4 h during the acute phase of the inflammation and at least 1 h in the lethal phase. This imaging system, which we termed two-photon IMPRESS (imaging pathophysiology research system), is broadly applicable to analyses of other respiratory pathogens and reveals disease progression at the cellular level in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
