This metabolic disorder can have an array of clinical signs, ranging from subtle abnormalities to a life-threatening emergency. Hypoglycemia can be due to several physiological processes or etiologies. It is imperative that the clinician is astute in diagnosing hypoglycemia, proficient in providing rapid symptomatic treatment (if indicated) and has a clear diagnostic plan to elucidate the underlying cause. This article reviews the pathophysiology, most common etiologies, and emergency management of hypoglycemia, and presents a diagnostic approach for this problem.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
