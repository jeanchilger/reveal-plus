Previous results suggest that inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) contributes transiently to MHV-induced demyelination. Herein, we show that equivalent amounts of demyelination were evident at day 12 after MHV infection in mice genetically deficient in NOS2 (NOS2(−/−)) and in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, using an established adoptive transfer model and pharmacological inhibitors of NOS2 function, we could demonstrate no effect on MHV-induced demyelination. These results indicate that NOS2 function is not required for demyelination in mice infected with MHV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
