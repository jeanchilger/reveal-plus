<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>First Report of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Human Metapneumovirus Co-Infection in a 2-Year-Old Kawasaki Patient in Iran</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: Respiratory virus infections in children are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. METHODS: A total of 897 clinical specimens were collected from February 2007 to January 2008 and transported to the National Influenza Center. Two hundred and two samples belonged to children under the age of six from 897 specimens, described above, were selected. Then they were tested for influenza virus types and subtypes by real time PCR assay subsequently, the specimens were tested for RSV and hMPV by hemi-nested multiplex PCR and parainfluenza viruses type 1–4 by hemi-nested multiplex PCR and adenovirus by hemi-nested PCR. RESULTS: The throat swab was taken from the Kawasaki case with the history of chicken’s contact. The specimen was tested for all influenza subtypes especially H5N1 and the results were negative. Meanwhile PCR was done for screening of other respiratory viruses that results came out positive for RSV and hMPV. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we demonstrated the possibility to detect dual infection caused by RSV and hMPV, but because of the extravagant pattern of this case, more investigation is suggested specially on Kawasaki patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
