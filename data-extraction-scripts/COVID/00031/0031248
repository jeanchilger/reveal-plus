<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-26</DATELINE><TITLE>De-isolating COVID-19 Suspect Cases: A Continuing Challenge</TITLE><BODY>As of 15 February 2020, Singapore had screened a total of 991 suspect cases for COVID-19, of which 72 cases tested positive, 812 cases tested negative, while the remaining 107 had pending results.(1) Besides optimising sample type to increase yield, (2) the challenge in clinical management of suspect cases lies in deciding whether they may be de-isolated or if further isolation and repeat testing is required. No single indicator may be effectively used to decide on de-isolation of a suspect case. In our series of positive cases, samples from one suspect case only returned positive on the fifth repeated sample (nasopharyngeal swab), on the seventh day of clinical illness. Current evidence suggests that transmission of COVID-19 may be possible even from asymptomatic contacts,(3) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing may not return positive initially. (4) Our suspect case was kept isolated because of a high index of clinical suspicion, with a clinically compatible illness and history of close contact with a laboratory-proven COVID-19 case. While multiplex respiratory virus panels, in general, may be helpful in the evaluation of other viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs), even the detection of an alternate respiratory pathogen may not definitively exclude COVID-19 infection. Dual infections can occur in 10- 20% of viral acute respiratory infections, as has been reported with SARS-CoV and MERSCoV. (5) In our case series, one patient with confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal aspirate also exhibited clinical symptoms compatible with dengue fever. This was laboratory confirmed by dengue NS1 antigen test. (PL Lim, personal communication).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
