MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patients aged <80 years with symptoms of ARTI were studied, during 2009-2010 Nasopharyngeal and dry throat swab specimens were collected and pathogens of ARTI was determined using multiplex real-time PCR. RESULTS: In this study, 455 cases with ARTI were studied. Mean age of studied population was 29.9 ± 18.5 (range: 0.2-80). Symptoms such as sore throat (86.3%), coryza (68.0%) and dry cough (54.3%) were the most common symptoms in all studied groups, whereas fever was the most clinical presentation of younger patients (<15 years old) and headache and skeletal pain were the most common symptoms of older patients (>15 years old). Rhinovirus was the most common cause of ARTI in patients aged <5 years and those aged >50 years. Influenza virus B was the most common cause of ARTI in patients aged 5-50 years.
