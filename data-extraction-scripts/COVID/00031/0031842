To improve the current knowledge of the regulatory role of a major mammalian cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin C, in such disease processes, a cystatin C deficient mouse was generated and characterized. METHODS: The mouse cystatin C gene was inactivated by insertion of a bacterial neo gene through homologous recombination in 129/Sv embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cell clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts followed by injection of the blastocysts into pseudopregnant female mice. F1 offspring with agouti coat colour after mating of chimaeric males with C57BL/6J females were examined by DNA analysis, and mice carrying the targeted mutation were intercrossed to obtain homozygous cystatin C deficient (CysC-/-) mice. To study the role of cysteine proteases and their inhibitors in metastasis, the spread of B16-F10 melanoma cells in CysC-/- and wild-type mice was compared. Analysis of the formation of remote metastases was carried out by intravenous injection of beta-galactosidase transfected B16-F10 cells and subsequent determination of cancer cell colonies in the lungs. RESULTS: Cystatin C deficient mice were fertile and showed no gross pathological abnormality up to 6 months of age. Compared with wild-type mice, seven times fewer large metastatic colonies were counted by means of a dissecting microscope in CysC-/- mice two weeks after tail vein injection of B16-F10 cells. At all of eight time points from 15 minutes to two weeks after intravenous injection of tumour cells, the CysC-/- mice had significantly fewer lung metastases. The observed differences were smaller when beta-galactosidase transfected cells were used to allow counting of small colonies. Subcutaneous and intracerebral tumour growth was not different in the CysC-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Cystatin C concentrations in vivo might influence metastasis in some tissues. The decreased metastatic spread of B16-F10 cells in CysC-/- mice is the result of both reduced seeding and reduced growth of tumour cells in their lungs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
