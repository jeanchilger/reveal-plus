They are also components of many synthetic compounds exhibiting a wide range of effects, including antiviral activity, antitumor and antiangiogenic activity, antibacterial, antitubercular, antifungal, antiaptotic, anticonvulsant and anxyolytic activities. Isatin itself is an endogenous oxidized indole with a wide spectrum of behavioral and metabolic effects. It has a distinct and discontinuous distribution in the brain, peripheral tissues and body fluids and isatin binding sites are widely distributed also. Its output is increased during stress. Its most potent known in vitro actions are as an antagonist of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) function and NO signaling. As we understand more about its function and sites of action we may be able to develop new pharmacological agents to mimic or counteract its activity. We consider here the most promising biological targets for various isatin analogues and/or metabolites, which are employed for the development of various groups of therapeutics. It is also possible that the level of endogenous isatin may influence the in vivo pharmacological activity of compounds possessing the isatin moiety.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
