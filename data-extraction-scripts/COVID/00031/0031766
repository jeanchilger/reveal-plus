Other murine glycoproteins in the Bgp subfamily, including Bgp1(b) and Bgp2, also can serve as MHV receptors when transfected into MHV-resistant cells. Previous studies have shown that the 108-amino-acid N-terminal domain of MHVR is essential for virus receptor activity and is the binding site for monoclonal antibody (MAb) CC1, an antireceptor MAb that blocks MHV infection in vivo and in vitro. To further elucidate the regions of MHVR required for virus receptor activity and MAb CC1 binding, we constructed chimeras between MHVR and other members of the CEA family and tested them for MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59) receptor activity and MAb CC1 binding activity. In addition, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce selected amino acid changes into the N-terminal domains of MHVR and these chimeras and tested the abilities of these mutant glycoproteins to bind MAb CC1 and to function as MHV receptors. Several recombinant glycoproteins exhibited virus receptor activity but did not bind MAb CC1, indicating that the virus and MAb binding sites on the N-terminal domain of MHVR are not identical. Analysis of the recombinant glycoproteins showed that a short region of MHVR, between amino acids 34 and 52, is critical for MHV-A59 receptor activity. Additional regions of the N-terminal variable domain and the constant domains, however, greatly affected receptor activity. Thus, the molecular context in which the amino acids critical for MHV-A59 receptor activity are found profoundly influences the virus receptor activity of the glycoprotein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
