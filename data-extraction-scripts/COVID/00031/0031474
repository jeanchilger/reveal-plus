By quantitative immunoelectron microscopy of rat endocrine pancreatic β cells and exocrine parotid and pancreatic cells, we show for the first time that the mannose 6–phosphate receptors (MPRs) for lysosomal enzyme sorting colocalize with the AP-1 adaptor in clathrin-coated buds on IGs. Furthermore, the concentrations of both MPR and AP-1 decline by ∼90% as the granules mature. Concomitantly, in exocrine secretory cells lysosomal proenzymes enter and then are sorted out of IGs, just as was previously observed in β cells (Kuliawat, R., J. Klumperman, T. Ludwig, and P. Arvan. 1997. J. Cell Biol. 137:595–608). The exit of MPRs in AP-1/clathrin-coated buds is selective, indicated by the fact that the membrane protein phogrin is not removed from maturing granules. We have also made the first observation of a soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, syntaxin 6, which has been implicated in clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking from the TGN to endosomes (Bock, J.B., J. Klumperman, S. Davanger, and R.H. Scheller. 1997. Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:1261–1271) that enters and then exits the regulated secretory pathway during granule maturation. Thus, we hypothesize that during secretory granule maturation, MPR–ligand complexes and syntaxin 6 are removed from IGs by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles, and then delivered to endosomes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
