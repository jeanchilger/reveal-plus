METHODS: The clinical data of COVID-19 patients from December 2019 to February 2020 were retrieved from four databases. We statistically analyzed the clinical symptoms and laboratory results of COVID-19 patients and explained the discharge rate, fatality rate with a single-arm meta-analysis. RESULTS: The available data of 1994 patients in 10 literatures were included in our study. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever (88.5%), cough (68.6%), myalgia or fatigue (35.8%), expectoration (28.2%), dyspnea (21.9%). Minor symptoms include headache or dizziness: (12.1%) diarrhea (4.8%), nausea, and vomiting (3.9%). The results of laboratory results showed that the lymphocytopenia (64.5%), increase of CRP (44.3%), increase of LDH (28.3%), and leukocytopenia (29.4%) were more common. CONCLUSIONS: The results of single-arm meta-analysis showed that: the male took a larger percentage in the gender distribution of COVID-19 patients 60%[95%CI (0.54,0.65)], the discharge rate of COVID-19 patients was 42%[95%CI (0.29,0.55)], and the fatality rate was 7%[95%CI (0.04,0.10)].
