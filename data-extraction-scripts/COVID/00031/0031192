The part of the virus imaged, called the spike protein, helps the virus attach to and infect human cells, and the determination of its structure comes just weeks after the virus’s genome sequence was published. The breakthrough is a huge step toward developing a vaccine against the virus as well as treatments for COVID-19, the disease that it causes, the researchers say. UT Austin’s Jason McLellan and his colleagues, who have spent many years studying other coronaviruses, had already figured out how to use select&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
