METHODS: To report all-cause deaths among Tianjin residents from 1999 through 2004, we standardized mortality rates to the world population in 2000. We analyzed age, sex, and geographic distribution of deaths from different causes and the leading causes of death in Tianjin. RESULTS: The 5 leading causes of death in Tianjin were cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, malignant neoplasm, chronic lower respiratory disease, and injuries and poisoning. Mortality in Tianjin declined from 0.60% in 1999 to 0.48% in 2004. Noncommunicable diseases accounted for more than 80% of all deaths. Infant and maternal mortality in Tianjin were low. Life expectancy of Tianjin residents increased every year but was consistently longer in women. When deaths from the main chronic diseases are not considered, life expectancy lengthens substantially. CONCLUSION: Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death in Tianjin, China. China should commit additional resources to supporting chronic disease prevention and control programs, including proven special health promotion projects.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
