C57BL/6 mice were susceptible to MHV3 infection and showed high titers of MHV3 in the peritoneal exudate 48 h after infection. A/J mice, in contrast, were resistant to the dose that killed 100% of the C57BL/6 mice (10 macrophage-infecting doses) and showed considerably lower virus titers than those shown by C57BL/6 mice. NK cell activity and interferon titers were significantly lower in the peritoneal exudate of A/J mice than in that of C57BL/6 mice. Serum interferon titers were also lower in A/J mice. Thus, our data show an inverse relationship between resistance and the levels of these two parameters. The data suggest that, in contrast to the situation observed with certain herpesviruses, interferon and NK cells may not be of overwhelming importance in the defense of mice against MHV3.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
