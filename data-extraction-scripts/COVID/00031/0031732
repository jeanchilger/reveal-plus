These were related to their pre-trial immune status as indicated by concentrations of specific antibodies and non-specific proteins in serum and nasal washings. Both circulating and local specific antibodies were associated with protection from infection and disease, but only specific IgA antibodies of either type appeared to shorten the period of virus shedding. Although total secretory IgA was significantly associated only with reduction of symptoms, total protein in nasal washings appeared to protect against infection also, indicating that other locally produced proteins, not identified, may be associated with resistance. Two of the many factors which may affect the concentration of circulating and local protective proteins and thus influence the outcome of virus inoculation, namely, sex of the volunteer and the interval since the previous cold, were examined. Male volunteers or volunteers who had had evidence of a recent respiratory infection were less likely to be infected, but if they were infected, they had lower clinical scores and stopped shedding virus earlier than the rest. These groups possessed higher concentrations of specific antibodies and non-specific proteins in their pre-challenge sera and/or nasal washings. The significance of these findings is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
