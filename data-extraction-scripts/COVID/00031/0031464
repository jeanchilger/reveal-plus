<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1999-01-25</DATELINE><TITLE>An Unconventional Role for Cytoplasmic Disulfide Bonds in Vaccinia Virus Proteins</TITLE><BODY>Previous data have shown that reducing agents disrupt the structure of vaccinia virus (vv). Here, we have analyzed the disulfide bonding of vv proteins in detail. In vv-infected cells cytoplasmically synthesized vv core proteins became disulfide bonded in the newly assembled intracellular mature viruses (IMVs). vv membrane proteins also assembled disulfide bonds, but independent of IMV formation and to a large extent on their cytoplasmic domains. If disulfide bonding was prevented, virus assembly was only partially impaired as shown by electron microscopy as well as a biochemical assay of IMV formation. Under these conditions, however, the membranes around the isolated particles appeared less stable and detached from the underlying core. During the viral infection process the membrane proteins remained disulfide bonded, whereas the core proteins were reduced, concomitant with delivery of the cores into the cytoplasm. Our data show that vv has evolved an unique system for the assembly of cytoplasmic disulfide bonds that are localized both on the exterior and interior parts of the IMV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
