These mice also routinely yielded macrophages that were susceptible to the same virus, MHV (PRI), in vitro after the mice had been treated with three intraperitoneal doses, of hydrocortisone. Dexamethasone and prednisolone when similarly administered also increased the susceptibility of C3H macrophages taken from the treated animal, but progesterone and testosterone did not. In addition, spleen cells from mice treated with cortisone made the resistant C3H macrophages 100 times more susceptible in vitro. Increased in vitro susceptibility induced in this way by hydrocortisone was reversed by exposure to supernatant fluid removed from cultures of concanavalin A-treated spleen cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
