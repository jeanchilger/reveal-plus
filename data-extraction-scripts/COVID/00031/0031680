It has been detected primarily in children with acute respiratory tract infections. This study was conducted to clarify the frequency and genotype circulation pattern of HBoV in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional PCR was performed on throat swabs of patients less than two years of age with respiratory illnesses during fall and winter 2012–2013. RESULTS: HBoV virus DNA was detected in 15 of 140 samples (10.7 %). Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis on 5 samples showed that all were HBoV1. The positive samples were negative for influenza A and B viruses while co-infection with RSV was found in 2 (13.3%). CONCLUSION: This study adds to the body of knowledge about the role of HBoV in acute respiratory illnesses in children in Iran.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
