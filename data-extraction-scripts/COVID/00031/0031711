Most backyard chicken flocks have a poor level of biosecurity, which increases the risk of spread of diseases. In recent years, the number of backyard chickens has been on the rise in Iran. However, the health status of backyard flocks is still poorly documented. Thus, this study aimed at examining the seroprevalence of antibodies against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and molecular surveillance and genotyping of IBV among backyard chickens (without vaccination history) in Mazandaran province, North of Iran, 2014. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 460 blood samples of unvaccinated backyard chickens in the mentioned area were tested for antibodies against IBV using commercial ELISA. Also, cecal tonsils were collected from 75 chickens in the same area. Real time RT-PCR (for detection) and RT-PCR and sequencing spike gene were performed. RESULTS: The seropositivity rate was 54.5%. In addition, we detected 793/B, Variant 2, and QX in the backyard flocks and performed phylogenetic studies on them. The phylogenetic study revealed that the detected genotypes had high homology with IBV strains that were infected broilers, pullets, and layers in Iran. CONCLUSION: There is a need for continuous monitoring of IBV among avian species to complete the epidemiological map and work on the pathogenesis of Iranian IBV strains in Iranian backyard chickens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
