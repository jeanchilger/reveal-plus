A characteristic feature of IBV is the occurrence of many different strains belonging to different serotypes, which renders complete control of the disease by vaccination a challenging task due to the poor cross-protection between different serotypes. In this study, based on the results of S1 sequence analysis and virus cross-neutralization tests, IBV strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 was found to be genetically and antigenically different from other known IBV types, representing not only a novel genotype, but also a novel serotype (designated as GI-28). Viruses belonging to this novel serotype have been isolated from several regions in China in recent years, suggesting endemic circulation of the serotype in various geographic locations in China. Further studies by complete genomic analysis showed that strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 may have originated from recombination events involving LX4 genotype IBVs and an as-yet-unidentified IBV donating a S1 gene, or from the result of accumulation of mutations and selections, especially in the S1 gene, from a LX4 genotype virus. ck/CH/LGX/111119 is a nephropathogenic strain, although it had broader tissue tropism (respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts) among chickens challenged at one day old. Infection of the oviducts with ck/CH/LGX/111119 found in this study may have severe implications because the virus will likely induce the occurrence of false layers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
