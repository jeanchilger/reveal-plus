<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Why Can't We Just Use PCR? The Role of Genotypic versus Phenotypic Testing for Antimicrobial Resistance Testing</TITLE><BODY>There is a need for phenotypic susceptibility testing that is expeditious and that can be performed directly from clinical specimens. While rapid pathogen identification is important, it is the susceptibility result that is essential for antimicrobial optimization. The options for rapid susceptibility testing are limited, with the majority of commercial tests available offering genotypic resistance detection only. In this article, a laboratorian and a clinician discuss the benefits and limitations of genotypic and phenotypic susceptibility testing and provide examples of how results should be interpreted to maximize the clinical utility.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
