The eradication of smallpox and the significant progress made toward polio eradication are clear examples of the great impact of antiviral vaccines. However, viral infections remain a major public health threat and a significant cause of death. Most of the antiviral vaccines introduced over the past century were empirically developed. Poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, and rubella are examples of diseases that are now largely controlled thanks to these empirically developed vaccines. However, there is a growing list of viral pathogens against which effective vaccines are yet to be developed. Recent technological advances will potentially provide us with new platforms that could be harnessed to develop vaccines against emerging and reemerging viral pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
