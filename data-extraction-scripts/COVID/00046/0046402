To our knowledge, trypsin ZT is the first thoroughly characterized group III trypsin. A more detailed understanding of trypsin ZT biochemistry may give insight into its physiological role as well as its potential use within the biotechnology sector. Stability is an important factor when it comes to practical applications of enzymes. Compared to trypsin I, trypsin ZT shows differences in pH and heat stability, sensitivity to inhibitors and sub-site substrate specificity as shown by multiplex substrate profiling analysis. Based on the analysis, trypsin ZT cleaved at arginine and lysine as other trypsins. Furthermore, trypsin ZT is better than trypsin I in cleaving peptides containing several consecutive positively charged residues. Lysine- and arginine-rich amino acid sequences are frequently found in human viral proteins. Thus, trypsin ZT may be effective in inactivating human and fish viruses implying a possible role for the enzyme in the natural defence of Atlantic cod. The results from this study can lead to multiple practical applications of trypsin ZT.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
