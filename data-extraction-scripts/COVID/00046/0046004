<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-08-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Field Triage of the Neonatal Foal</TITLE><BODY>The purpose of this article is to provide a quick reference for field triage of the sick neonatal foal. Therefore, information is focused toward diagnostics and treatments that can be performed in the field. When evaluating a weak, recumbent, or lethargic foal on a farm, it is often difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, the approach should be to treat what is treatable and prevent what is preventable. In many cases, the goal will be to stabilize a foal before referral to a tertiary care facility where more intensive and continuous treatment can be performed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
