<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Comparative Pancreatic Pathology</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Spontaneous pathologies of the pancreas are important causes of morbidity and mortality in some veterinary species and rare in others. As in human beings, the pancreas of most domestic and exotic animals is a composite organ with both endocrine and exocrine functions. The similarities between structure and function of porcine, canine, and human pancreata are such that the pig and dog serve as valuable models in basic and translational studies, most recently for efforts aimed at modeling pancreatitis and diabetes, developing functional and sustainable replacement of endocrine functions, and in imaging and manipulation studies. This article will provide a brief review of spontaneous veterinary diseases and their underlying mechanisms and the morphological features that reflect these alterations. Several species- or breed-specific conditions and the effects of selected systemic diseases on the pancreas are also discussed. The contributions to our knowledge of pancreatic physiology and pathology by small mammal (rodent) and engineered animal models and the in-depth mechanisms homologous to those in the human pancreas are covered in other sections of this article.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
