The level of targeted protein expression and siRNA uptake were examined in A549 cells. CS-modified PLGA NS exhibited much higher encapsulation efficiency than unmodified PLGA NS (plain-PLGA NS). CS-modified PLGA NS showed a positive zeta potential, while plain-PLGA NS were negatively charged. siRNA uptake studies by observation with confocal leaser scanning microscopy (CLSM) indicated that siRNA-loaded CS-modified PLGA NS were more effectively taken up by the cells than plain-PLGA NS. The efficiencies of different siRNA preparations were compared at the level of targeted protein expression. The gene-silencing efficiency of CS-modified PLGA NS was higher and more prolonged than those of plain-PLGA NS and naked siRNA. This result correlated with the CLSM studies, which may have been due to higher cellular uptake of CS-modified PLGA NS due to electrostatic interactions. It was concluded that CS-modified PLGA NS containing siRNA could provide an effective siRNA delivery system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
