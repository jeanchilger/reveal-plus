Thirty-six of the 54 identified proteins have homologs in another invertebrate and/or in one or more vertebrate iridoviruses. The genes for 5 of the identified proteins, 22L (putative helicase), 118L, 142R (putative RNaseIII), 274L (major capsid protein) and 295L, are shared by all iridoviruses for which the complete nucleotide sequence is known and may therefore be considered as iridovirus core genes. Three identified proteins have homologs only in ascoviruses. The remaining 15 identified proteins are so far unique to CIV. In addition to broadening our insight in the structure and assembly of CIV virions, this knowledge is pivotal to unravel the initial steps in the infection process.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
