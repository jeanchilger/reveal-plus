Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes serious vomiting and diarrhea in suckling piglets. In this study, the role of Ca(2+) to PDCoV infection was investigated. PDCoV infection was found to upregulate intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations of IPI-2I cells. Chelating extracellular Ca(2+) by EGTA inhibited PDCoV replication, and this inhibitory effect was overcome by replenishment with CaCl(2). Treatment with Ca(2+) channel blockers, particularly the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker diltiazem hydrochloride, inhibited PDCoV infection significantly. Mechanistically, diltiazem hydrochloride reduces PDCoV infection by inhibiting the replication step of the viral replication cycle. Additionally, knockdown of CACNA1S, the L-type Ca(2+) voltage-gated channel subunit, inhibited PDCoV replication. The combined results demonstrate that PDCoV modulates calcium influx to favor its replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
