<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>The prospect of pandemic influenza: Why should the optometrist be concerned about a public health problem?</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Background Optometrists are uniquely placed in the health care field because they provide both services as well as goods to patients. In the event of an influenza pandemic, optometrists may be challenged with a host of issues, including impediments to clinical patient care, manufacture and delivery of ophthalmic devices, and maintaining business continuity and infection control. Overview This report reviews pandemic influenza, the effect of a pandemic event on business survival, and response measures for the primary eye care provider. The ethical and legal issues surrounding control of a pandemic influenza and the prospect of telemedicine as a form of social distancing are also discussed. Conclusions Knowledge of the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures to control a pandemic influenza will help prepare the eye care provider for addressing challenges to patient care and business continuity in the face of a highly contagious disease. Understanding the legal and ethical issues that arise during a pandemic event will help optometrists make informed choices as health care professionals and as citizens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
