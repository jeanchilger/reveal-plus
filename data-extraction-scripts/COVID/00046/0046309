Fimbria-assisted display of heterologous sequences is a paradigm for chimeric organelle display on bacteria. Fimbriae are particularly attractive candidates for epitope display for several reasons: (1) they are present in extremely high numbers at the cell surface, (2) they are strong immunogens, (3) they possess inherent adhesive properties, and (4) they can be easily purified. The majority of work dealing with fimbria-assisted peptide display has been focused on the development of recombinant vaccines. A number of different fimbrial types have been used to display immune-relevant sectors of various foreign proteins. Chimeric fimbrial vaccines can be used in the context of purified proteins, however the potential also exists to exploit this technology for the development of live recombinant vaccines. Work has also been performed demonstrating the amenability of fimbriae towards the powerful technology of random peptide display. This review summarises the current state of research in this field.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
