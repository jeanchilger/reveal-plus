Tissue engineering has generated much interest from researchers in many fields, including cell and molecular biology, biomedical engineering, transplant medicine, and organic chemistry. Attempts to build tissues or organs in vitro have utilized both scaffold and scaffold-free approaches. Despite considerable progress, fabrication of three-dimensional tissue constructs in vitro remains a challenge. In this chapter, we introduce and discus current concepts of tissue engineering with particular focus on future clinical application.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
