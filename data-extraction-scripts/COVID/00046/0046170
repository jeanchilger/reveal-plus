Until now, there have been no specific medicines to treat influenza A H7N9 virus infected patients. Development of a safe and effective H7N9 therapeutic preparation is urgently needed. To this end, we prepared and evaluated the pepsin-digested F(ab′)2 fragments of serum IgGs from the horses inoculated with a inactivated influenza A H7N9 whole virus antigens. The protective effects of the F(ab′)2 fragments against H7N9 virus infection were determined in cultured MDCK cells by cytopathic effect (CPE) and evaluated in a BALB/c mouse model by observing death, weight loss and viral load. The in vitro results showed that the F(ab′)2 fragments had an HI titer of 1:2048 and a neutralization titer of 1: 31,623. The in vivo assays suggested that 600U of the preparations could efficiently protect BALB/c mice from a lethal dose of A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9) infection even when administered two days post infection. Thus, this highly purified preparation should be a potential candidate for treating severe patients suffering from influenza A H7N9.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
