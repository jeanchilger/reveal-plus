In this introduction to a special issue of Applied Geography, we set out to articulate the importance of urban spatial context in broader present-day inequality debates. We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales. Contributions to this special issue from North America, Europe, South America, and China suggest that deepening urban inequalities are pervasive across the globe.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
