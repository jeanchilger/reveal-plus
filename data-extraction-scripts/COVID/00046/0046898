The use of facial protective equipment (FPE) is an important strategy to prevent occupational transmission. METHODS: A 2-phased study was conducted to examine nurse's adherence to recommended use of FPE. Phase 1 was a cross-sectional survey of nurses in selected units of 6 acute care hospitals in Toronto, Canada. Phase 2 was a direct observational study of critical care nurses. RESULTS: Of the 1,074 nurses who completed surveys (82% response rate), 44% reported adherence to recommended use of FPE. Multivariable analysis revealed 6 predictors of adherence: unit type, frequency of equipment use, equipment availability, training, organizational support, and communication. Following the survey, 100 observations in 14 intensive care units were conducted that revealed a 44% competence rate with proper use of N95 respirators and knowledge as a significant predictor of competence. CONCLUSION: Whereas increasing knowledge should enhance competence, strategies to improve adherence to recommended use of FPE in a busy and complex health care setting should focus on ready availability of equipment, training and fit testing, organizational support for worker health and safety, and good communication practices.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
