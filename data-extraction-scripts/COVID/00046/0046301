Vero cells were dually infected with ca-PEDV and one of the three chlamydial strains Chlamydia trachomatis S45, Chlamydophila abortus S26/3 or Chlamydophila pecorum 1710S. Three experimental protocols were designed varying the inoculation sequence. Cell layers were first inoculated with Chlamydiaceae and 20h later with ca-PEDV in protocol one. In protocol two, both agents were administered concurrently, whereas in protocol three, ca-PEDV was applied 20h in advance of the Chlamydiaceae. Immunofluorescence techniques, immunohistochemical (IH) staining and electron microscopy were subsequently employed to investigate the cell layers. Using indirect immunofluorescence (IF) labeling, all mixed infections revealed dually infected cells, however, only incidentally and in low numbers. Characteristically, ca-PEDV syncytia with one or more chlamydial inclusions were detected but dually infected single cells were absent. Some syncytial cells contained enlarged C. abortus or C. pecorum inclusions with abnormally large developmental forms. In comparison with simultaneously conducted monoinfections, larger chlamydial inclusions were observed in dually infected cell layers. Experiments with C. trachomatis showed significantly increased numbers of chlamydial inclusions in dually infected cell layers compared to monoinfected ones. These findings indicate an influence of ca-PEDV on the chlamydial developmental cycle and in the case of C. trachomatis, a positive effect on chlamydial colonization in mixed infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
