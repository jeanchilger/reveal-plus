Inoculation of the central nervous system (CNS) of CXCL9−/− mice with MHV resulted in accelerated and increased mortality compared to wildtype mice supporting an important role for CXCL9 in antiviral defense. In addition, infection of RAG1−/− or CXCL9−/− mice with a recombinant MHV expressing CXCL9 (MHV-CXCL9) resulted in protection from disease that correlated with reduced viral titers within the brain and NK cell-mediated protection in the liver. Survival in MHV-CXCL9-infected CXCL9−/− mice was associated with reduced viral burden within the brain that coincided with increased T cell infiltration. Similarly, viral clearance from the livers of MHV-CXCL9-infected mice was accelerated but independent of increased T cell or NK cell infiltration. These observations indicate that CXCL9 promotes protection from coronavirus-induced neurological and liver disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
