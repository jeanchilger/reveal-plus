Methods In the current study, the variant PEDV strain HM2017 was isolated and purified and a viral growth curve was constructed according to the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). HM2017 were amplify with RT-PCR and analyzed by phylogeny analysis. Animal pathogenicity experiment was carried to evaluate the HM2017 clinical assessment. Results Genome-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that PEDV strain HM2017 was clustered into the variant subgroup GII-a that is currently circulating in pig populations in China. The highest median tissue culture infectious dose of strain HM2017 after 15 passages in Vero cells was 1.33 × 107 viral particles/mL. Strain HM2017 was highly virulent to suckling piglets, which exhibited clinical symptoms at 12 h post-infection (hpi) (i.e., weight loss at 12–84 hpi, increased body temperatures at 24–48 hpi, high viral loads in the jejunum and ileum, and 100% mortality by 84 hpi). Conclusion The present study reports a variant subgroup GII-a PEDV HM2017 strain in China and characterize its pathogenicity. PEDV strain HM2017 of subgroup GII-a presents a promising vaccine candidate for the control of PED outbreaks in China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
