However, pseudotyping systems that predominantly produce non-filamentous particles have frequently been used to prove this concept. Here, we report that GP-mediated entry of retroviral-, rhabdoviral and filoviral particles depends on CatB/CatL activity and that this effect is cell line-independent. Moreover, we show that the human cell line Calu-3, which expresses low amounts of CatL, is largely resistant to entry driven by diverse filovirus GPs. Finally, we demonstrate that Calu-3 cell entry mediated by certain filovirus GPs can be rescued upon directed expression of CatL or DC-SIGN. Our results identify Calu-3 cells as largely resistant to filovirus GP-driven entry and demonstrate that entry is limited at the stage of virion attachment and GP priming.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
