<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Zoonoses</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Zoonotic viral infections represent an important public health problem across the globe.

The recent upsurge in Ebola virus infections in West Africa and the emergence of Zika virus in the Western Hemisphere are highlighted.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
