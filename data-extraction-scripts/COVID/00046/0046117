On the basis of surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS), Ciphergen’s proteinchip system offers a single, unified, and high throughput platform for a multitude of proteomic research applications. Proteins are the major functional components of the cell. The study of proteomics helps to better understand the mechanism of a disease. Remarkable findings in disease biomarkers have shed light on the early diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis of various diseases, especially for cancer. In this paper, the development and technology of SELDI-TOF MS are introduced. The research progress and encouraging research results in malignancies, infectious diseases, neurological diseases, and diabetes mellitus using SELDI-TOF MS are reviewed. This paper concludes by evaluating the pros and cons, and the future perspectives are also expounded.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
