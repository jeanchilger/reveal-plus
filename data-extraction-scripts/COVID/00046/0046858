Morphological and biochemical alterations typical of apoptosis were analyzed in infected cells using a combination of techniques, including DAPI staining, the sub-G(0)/G(1) technique and the TUNEL assay. The onset of apoptosis was directly proportional to the virus multiplicity of infection. Transient expression experiments showed a direct link between astrovirus ORF1a encoded proteins and apoptosis induction. A computer analysis of the astrovirus genome revealed the presence of a death domain in the nonstructural protein p38 of unknown function, encoded in ORF1a. Apoptosis inhibition experiments suggested the involvement of caspase 8 in the apoptotic response, and led to a reduction in the infectivity of the virus progeny released to the supernatant. We conclude that apoptotic death of host cells seems necessary for efficient human astrovirus replication and particle maturation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
