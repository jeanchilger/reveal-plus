However, many of these systems are expensive and non-portable. Therefore, we developed a cost-effective and compact (2.9 × 5.8 × 2.0cm) thermopile array for fever screening of patients with infectious diseases in the clinical setting. Methods The array was created with small pixels (48 × 47 = 2256 pixels) fabricated on a silicon wafer using microelectromechanical systems technology. We tested this array on 155 febrile and afebrile patients (35.4°C ≤ axillary temperature ≤ 39.3°C) with seasonal influenza at the Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital. Results The maximum facial temperature, measured by the array at 0.3 m from the subject, exhibited a positive correlation with axillary temperature measured using a contact-type thermometer (r = 0.71, p < 0.01). The sensitivity and specificity of the thermopile array in identifying the febrile subjects were 80.5% and 93.3%, respectively, setting the threshold cut-off of maximum facial temperature at an appropriate value. Conclusions Our cost-effective thermopile array appears promising for future close-range fever screening of patients with infectious diseases at primary care doctor clinics, health care centers, and quarantine stations in developing and developed countries.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
