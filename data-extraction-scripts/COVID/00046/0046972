<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-10-31</DATELINE><TITLE>A Retrospective Study of 286 Cases of Neurological Disorders of the Cat</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Archive central nervous tissue from 286 cats with neurological disorders was reviewed for histological evidence of feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE), which may have occurred before it was first recognized in 1990. The following six categories of disease were identified: congenital; degenerative; inflammatory; neoplastic; FSE; lesion-free. The largest category (inflammatory) contained 92 cats, of which 47 were considered to be consistent with infection by feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus. Six cats showed evidence of more than one disease process; thus, one cat with FIP also had toxocara infection of the lateral ventricles and five cats with FSE also showed perivascular cuffing suggestive of concurrent viral infection. In only two cases did the diagnosis on review differ significantly from the original interpretation. There was no evidence of FSE before the original case was recognized in April 1990.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
