<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-01-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Public health and clinical laboratories: Partners in the age of emerging infections</TITLE><BODY>Clinical and public health laboratories have experienced unprecedented challenges in the form of demands to comply with revised regulations and economic pressures to be more efficient while preparing to respond to everything from pandemic influenza to bioterrorism. These forces have been an impetus for laboratorians to communicate, cooperate, and collaborate as never before and to seek the common ground where knowledge and resources can be shared to weather the profound economic and political forces at work today.
