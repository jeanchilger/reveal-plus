The in-house developed multicomponent reaction based on commercially available starting materials was applied and broad biological screening against various viruses was performed, showing promising antiviral properties for compounds 14d, 14n, 14q, 18f and 18i against human coronavirus 229E. Further in silico studies identified the key molecular interactions between those compounds and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, which is essential to the intracellular replication of the virus, supporting the hypothesis that the protease is the target molecule of the potential antiviral derivatives.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
