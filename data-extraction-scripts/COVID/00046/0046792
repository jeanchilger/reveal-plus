Under explicit consideration of asymptomatic and symptomatic infective individuals for the basic model without intervention the analysis shows that the dynamics of the epidemic is determined by a basic reproduction number R 0 . A disease-free and an endemic equilibrium exist and are locally asymptotically stable when R 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1 respectively. When treatment is included the system has a basic reproduction number, which is the largest of the two reproduction numbers that characterise the drug-sensitive ( R 1 ) or resistant ( R 2 ) strains of the infectious agent. The system has a disease-free equilibrium, which is stable when both R 1 and R 2 are less than unity. Two endemic equilibria also exist and are associated with treatment and the development of drug resistance. An endemic equilibrium where only the drug-resistant strain persists exists and is stable when R 2 > 1 and R 1 < R 2 . A second endemic equilibrium exists when R 1 > 1 and R 1 > R 2 and both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains are present. The analysis of the system provides insights about the conditions under which the infection will persist and whether sensitive and resistant strains will coexist or not.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
