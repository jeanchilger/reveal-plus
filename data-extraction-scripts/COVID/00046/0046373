Previously, by comparing serotype II strains FIPV 79-1146 and FECV 79-1683 and recombinant chimeric forms thereof in cultured feline bone marrow macrophages, we mapped this difference to the C-terminal part of the viral spike (S) protein (S2). In view of the later identified diagnostic difference in this very part of the S protein of serotype I FCoV pathotypes, the present study aimed to further define the contribution of the earlier observed ten amino acids difference to the serotype II virus phenotype in macrophages. Using targeted RNA recombination as a reverse genetics system we introduced the mutations singly and in combinations into the S gene and evaluated their effects on the infection characteristics of the mutant viruses in macrophages. While some of the single mutations had a significant effect, none of them fully reverted the infection phenotype. Only by combining five specific mutations the infections mediated by the FIPV and FECV spike proteins could be fully blocked or potentiated, respectively. Hence, the differential macrophage infection phenotype is caused by the cooperative effect of five mutations, which occur in five functionally different domains of the spike fusion subunit S2. The significance of these observations will be discussed, taking into account also some questions related to the identity of the virus strains used.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
