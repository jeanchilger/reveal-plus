For many years, conventional virus isolation was the mainstay of viral diagnosis since it was sensitive and “open-minded.” However, growth in conventional cell culture entails an inherent delay that limits its clinical impact. Although rapid culture and viral antigen methods detect fewer pathogens and are less sensitive than conventional culture, both require less expertise and have greatly reduced time to result. Polymerase chain reaction has ushered in a new era in virology, especially in the diagnosis of neurologic diseases. Molecular amplification methods are rapid, highly sensitive, can be automated, quantitative, and detect viruses not amenable to routine culture. User-friendly, walk-away tests with results in an hour, as well as multiplex tests that can detect 20 viruses in a single reaction, are now a reality. As the variety of test methods and commercial products proliferate, the challenges for clinicians and laboratories are selecting which tests to utilize in which clinical scenarios, and understanding how to interpret the results. The advantages and limitations of each method are discussed in this chapter, with special attention to neurologic disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
