<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-11-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Infections in Pregnancy</TITLE><BODY>Infections during pregnancy may affect a developing fetus. If left untreated, these infections can lead to the death of the mother, fetus, or neonate and other adverse sequelae. There are many factors that impact infection during pregnancy, such as the immune system changes during pregnancy, hormonal flux, stress, and the microbiome. We review some of the outcomes of infection during pregnancy, such as preterm birth, chorioamnionitis, meningitis, hydrocephaly, developmental delays, microcephaly, and sepsis. Transmission routes are discussed regarding how a pregnant woman may pass her infection to her fetus. This is followed by examples of infection during pregnancy: bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections. There are many known organisms that are capable of producing similar congenital defects during pregnancy; however, whether these infections share common mechanisms of action is yet to be determined. To protect the health of pregnant women and their offspring, additional research is needed to understand how these intrauterine infections adversely affect pregnancies and/or neonates in order to develop prevention strategies and treatments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
