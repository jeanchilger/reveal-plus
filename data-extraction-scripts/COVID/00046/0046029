From a self-administered questionnaire survey among inpatient nurses at a tertiary hospital, we observed that the strongest factors associated with intention for future vaccination were perceived benefits of and motivations for vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.55-4.27), and perceived nonsusceptibility to influenza and preference for vaccination alternatives (aOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.20-0.34). These factors need to be addressed to increase vaccination uptake and prevent nosocomial transmission.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
