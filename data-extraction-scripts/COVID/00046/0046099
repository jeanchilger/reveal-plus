Although mesothelial cells are known to express multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which contribute to trigger innate immune responses against infections, the precise molecular mechanism remains still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of Toll/IL-1 domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF), one of the two major TLRs–adaptor molecules, on innate immune response induced by TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation in murine peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs). TRIF was strongly expressed in PMCs and its deficiency led to impaired production of cytokines and chemokines by poly I:C and LPS in the cells. Activation of NF-κB or MAPKs through poly I:C and LPS stimulation was reduced in TRIF-deficient PMCs as compared to the WT cells. TRIF was also necessary for optimal nitric oxide synthesis and gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IFN-β in PMCs in response to poly I:C and LPS. Furthermore, both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced high level of IL-6, CXCL1, and CCL2 production in PMCs, which was significantly impaired by TRIF deficiency. These results demonstrated that TRIF is required for optimal activation of innate immune responses in mesothelial cells against microbial infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
