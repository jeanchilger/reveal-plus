This vector contains an MHV intergenic sequence to promote the expression of foreign genes. In this study, we used this vector to introduce a hemagglutininesterase (HE) protein, an optional MHV structural protein, into the MHV-infected cells. The engineered HE protein could be efficiently incorporated into the virion which did not synthesize its own HE protein, thus generating a pseudorecombinant virus that expresses an exogenous HE protein. The engineered HE protein could be made distinguishable from the native protein by attaching an 8-amino-acid peptide tag at the carboxyl-terminus. Both the engineered and native HE proteins from the HE-producing virus train could be incorporated into the virion, thus generating phenotypically mixed virus parficles. We also showed that the HE-expressing DI RNA could be incorporated into viruses, and the engineered HE protein expressed in the infected cells for at least three serial virus passages. Furthermore, we have made two mutants, in which parts of the external domain of the HE protein have been deleted, to study the sequence requirements for the stable expression of HE and its incorporation into MHV virions. Although both of the mutant HE proteins could be expressed in the MHV-infected cells, they failed to be incorporated into virions, suggesting the importance of the extracellular domain of HE protein for its incorporation into virus particles. This vector system enabled the first successful incorporation of a selected coronaviral protein into virions and demonstrates its utility as an expression vector for studying the molecular biology of coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
