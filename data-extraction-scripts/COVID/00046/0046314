The aim of the present study was isolate enteric pathogens from rabbits in Mexico. Using parasitological, bacteriological and molecular analyses, we screened 58 samples of the intestinal content of rabbits having a clinical history of enteric disease from the southeastern part of the State of Mexico. Out of the 58 samples analyzed, a total of 86 identifications were made, Eimeria spp. were found in 77.5%, followed by Aeromonas spp. in 15.5% and Escherichia coli in 8.6%, which were identified as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and the presence of the following agents was also confirmed: Salmonella spp., Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Mannheimia spp. and Rotavirus. The concurrent presence of Eimeria spp. with Aeromonas was frequent (15.5%); there was statistical significance for the presence of an association between the clinical profiles and Eimeria spp. (p =0.000), Mannheimia spp. (p =0.001), Salmonella spp., Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. (p =0.006).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
