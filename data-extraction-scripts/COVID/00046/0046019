In both young and aged mice, an intranasal Protollin-formulated S-protein vaccine elicited high levels of antigen-specific IgG in serum, comparable to those elicited by an intramuscular Alum-adsorbed S-protein vaccine. Serum antibodies were shown to be virus neutralizing. Intranasal immunization of young mice with the Protollin-formulated vaccine elicited significant levels of antigen-specific lung IgA in contrast to mice immunized with the intramuscular vaccine in which no antigen-specific lung IgA was detected. Following live virus challenge of aged mice, no virus was detected in the lungs of intranasally immunized mice, in contrast to intramuscularly immunized mice whose lung virus titers were comparable to those observed in control mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
