The study was carried out on 71 faecal samples of pups with enteritis. Of 71 samples examined 14 were positive in PCR, whereas 30 samples resulted positive in the n-PCR assay. CCV was detected by EM examination in only four out of 45 samples, and by virus isolation in three out of 30 samples n-PCR positive.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
