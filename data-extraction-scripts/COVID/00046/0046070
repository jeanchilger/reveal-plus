In the existing anomaly detection approaches, Markov chain techniques are widely accepted for their simple realization and few parameters. However, the short memory property of a classical Markov model ignores the interaction among data, and the long memory property of a higher order Markov model clouds the relationship between the previous data and current test data, and reduces the reliability of the model. Besides, both of these models cannot successfully describe the sequences changing with a tendency. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on a dynamic Markov model. This approach segments sequence data by a sliding window. In the sliding window, we define the states of data according to the value of the data and establish a higher order Markov model with a proper order consequently, to balance the length of the memory property and keep up with the trend of sequences. In addition, an anomaly substitution strategy is proposed to prevent the detected anomalies from impacting the building of the models and keep anomaly detection continuously. The experimental results using simulated datasets and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach improves the adaptability and stability of anomaly detection in sequence data.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
