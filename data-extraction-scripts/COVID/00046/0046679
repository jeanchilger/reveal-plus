Metallic NPs such as gold and silver NPs, synthesized using natural materials are an important branch of inorganic NPs with catalytic functionalities and a diverse range of biomedical applications such as antimicrobial application. Polysaccharides are excellent candidates to stabilize and control the size of NPs during the synthesis process. These polymers possess multiple binding sites, which facilitate attachment to the metal surface. As a result, polysaccharides can effectively create an organic-inorganic network of the metal NPs and confer a significant protection against aggregation and chemical modifications. This chapter discusses the methods of the preparation of polysaccharide-mediated NPs and reviews various types and diverse applications for these novel materials.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
