Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins. Tunicamycin completely blocked glycosylation of GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7. In contrast, GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b were partially glycosyaated in the presence of tunicamycin. These results indicated that GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7 are N-linked glycoproteins, but GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensin-treated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay. Thus, complete glycosylation may not be essential for maintenance of antigenicity and participation in immune destruction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
