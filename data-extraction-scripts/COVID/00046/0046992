The purpose of these studies was to elucidate mechanisms by which host cells regulate the level of virus infection and expression and to assess host cell cytokine responses to virus infection. Cells used for the analyzes included four IL-2-dependent continuous T-cell lines (104-C1, 104-C7, MCH5-4 and DB FeTs) which arose from long-term passage, followed by limiting dilution cloning of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); two IL-2-independent T-cell lines (104-C1DL and MCH5-4DL) which originated from two of the IL-2-dependent lines, 104-C1 and MCH5-4; respectively; Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK); G355-5 brain-derived glial cells; and the T-cell lymphoma line, 3201. Cells were infected with FIV-PPR, FIV-34TF10, FIV 34TF10orf2rep, and a variant arising from FIV-PPR during ex vivo passage on 104-C1DL cells, termed FIV-PPRglial. Infection of the IL-2-dependent T-cell line, 104-C1, by FIV-PPR resulted in the specific and distinct upregulation of cytokine expression. In particular, these cells doubled their expression of the pleiotropic cytokines, interleukin-4 and interleukin-12 after FIV infection. Interferon-γ production also increased after infection with FIV whereas, TNFα expression remained constant. Also, a marked upregulation of MHC class II expression was noted post infection of MCH5-4 and 104-C1 cells with FIV-PPR. Similar results were obtained after infection with FIV-34TF10orf2rep, indicating that the upregulation of cytokine expression is not an isolate-specific phenomenon. Changes in cytokine and class II expression are similar to various reports for the in vivo cytokine alterations in FIV, SIV and HIV infections. The ex vivo infection of these cell lines offers a manipulable system to examine the mechanism(s) by which lentiviruses alter cytokine expression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
