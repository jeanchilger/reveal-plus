<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Respiratory disease in pregnancy</TITLE><BODY>Abstract A variety of respiratory complications can be encountered in pregnancy. An understanding of the pathophysiology of pregnancy is important in the management of such complications. Despite the changes in immunity, the incidence of respiratory infections is not higher in pregnancy. Asthma is the most common preexisting medical disorder encountered in pregnancy, and its prevalence in women of childbearing age is increasing. There is a slight increase in the risk to the pregnancy, but suboptimal therapy is the most common reason for poor control. X-rays should be obtained whenever clinically indicated, and most drugs used in the management of asthma have a long track record of safety. For women with poor control in pregnancy, there should be good liaison between the respiratory physician and the obstetrician. Tuberculosis is increasingly important and may complicate human immunodeficiency virus infection. First-line antituberculous drugs can safely be administered in pregnancy and lactation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
