<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-10-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Life-Threatening Infection in Transplant Recipients</TITLE><BODY>Modern post-transplant care pathways commonly encompass periods of critical care support. Infectious events account for many of these interactions making critical care physicians integral members of multidisciplinary transplant teams. Despite continuing advances in clinical care and infection prophylaxis, the morbidity and mortality attributable to infection post-transplant remains considerable. Emerging entities constantly add to the breadth of potential opportunistic pathogens. Individualized risk assessments, rapid and thorough diagnostic evaluation, and prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapies are essential. The approach to managing transplant recipients with infection in critical care is discussed and common and emerging opportunistic pathogens are reviewed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
