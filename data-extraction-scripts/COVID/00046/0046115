Four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) were defined by competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) selected from 9 fusions. About 20% (197) of the hybridomas specific for TGE virus produced neutralizing MAbs specific for site A, which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants. Site A was differentiated in three antigenic subsites: a, b and c, by characterization of 11 MAb resistant (mar) mutants, that were defined by 8, 3, and 3 MAbs, respectively. These subsites were further subdivided in epitopes. A total of 11 epitopes were defined in E2 glycoprotein, eight of which were critical for virus neutralization. Neutralizing MAbs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice, although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native, denatured, or mixtures of native and denatured form. All neutralizing MAbs reacted to conformational epitopes. The antigenic structure of the E2-glycoprotein has been defined with murine MAbs, but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine, the natural host of the virus, because porcine sera reacted against these sites. MAbs specific for TGE virus site C reacted to non-immune porcine sera. This reactivity was not directed against porcine immunoglobulins. These results indicated that TGE virus contains epitope(s) also present in some non-immunoglobulin component of porcine serum.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
