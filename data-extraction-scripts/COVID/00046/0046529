<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1985-02-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Abnormalities of serum and plasma components in patients with multiple sclerosis</TITLE><BODY>Qualitative and quantitative abnormalities in protein and non-protein components of serum and plasma in patients with multiple sclerosis have been the subjects of numerous reports. In this review many of the more recent observations are documented and evaluated. It is concluded that at present the welter of information that has been gathered does not contribute in any major, coherent way to our understanding of the etiology or pathogenesis of the disorder. Several of the abnormalities that have been observed may be future candidates for biochemical markers for multiple sclerosis; at present none is sufficiently reliable, distinctive or easily performed to warrant the status of a useful diagnostic or prognostic test.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
