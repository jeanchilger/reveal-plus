Furthermore, both enzymes could be detected on the cell surface of human T lymphocytes and especially aminopeptidase N on human synovial fibroblasts. Gold labelled vesicular structures were also found in the cytoplasm in the apical part of renal proximal tubular cells and synovial fibroblasts. In human kidney the colocalization of the two membrane antigens was possible by using several double labelling methods.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
