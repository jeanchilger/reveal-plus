However, there is currently no drug selectively targeting HIV-associated HMGs. Here, we describe a novel HMG-targeting “lectibody,” a recombinant Fc-fusion protein comprising human IgG1 Fc and a novel actinohivin lectin variant (Avaren) obtained by structure-guided modifications for improved overall surface charge properties (AvFc). AvFc was engineered and produced using a rapid and scalable plant-based transient overexpression system. The lectibody exhibited potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 groups M and O primary viruses, as well as HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains, without affecting normal human blood cells. Furthermore, the lectibody induced Fc-mediated cell killing activity against HIV-1-infected cells and selectively recognized SIVmac239-infected macaque mesenteric lymph node cells in vitro. AvFc showed an extended serum half-life in rats and rhesus macaques, while no discernible toxicity was observed upon repeated systemic dosing in mice. These results highlight AvFc’s potential as a biotherapeutic targeting HIV-associated HMGs of cell-free virions, as well as productively infected cells, providing a foundation for new anti-HIV strategies. Efficient and cost-effective bioproduction in greenhouse facilities may open unique possibilities for further development of AvFc.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
