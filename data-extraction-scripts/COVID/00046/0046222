This article describes a novel assay method of HIV-PR based on the selective fluorogenic reaction of peptides. A peptide fragment generated from a substrate by the enzymatic digestion with HIV-PR could be selectively quantified by the spectrofluorometric detection after the fluorogenic reaction with catechol in the presence of sodium periodate and sodium borate (pH 7.0). This assay system uses an N-terminal acetyl peptide as the substrate and crude extracts from Escherichia coli expressing recombinant HIV-PR. The activity obtained by the proposed assay correlated with that obtained by a conventional HIV-PR assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer detection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
