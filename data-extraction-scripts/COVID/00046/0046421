The acute phase response is comprised of reactions localized at the site of infection, as well as the initiation of systemic responses, which include a rapid increase in the serum concentration of some proteins, known as acute phase proteins (APP). Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected two APP of approximately 22 and 37 kDa molecular weight in sera obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Based on their presence in the sera of sick, but not normal animals, the molecular weights, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and the ability to bind hemoglobin, we identified these proteins as the α and β subunits of haptoglobin. The haptoglobin molecule and the α subunit were isolated from serum, purified, and used to produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. With these reagents, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure the concentration of haptoglobin in bovine serum. Using an experimental model of BRD induced by a sequential challenge of calves with bovine herpesvirus type-1 and Pasteurella haemolytica, we observed a temporal relationship between the increase in haptoglobin concentration in serum and the onset of bacterial infection. The haptoglobin concentration ranged from undetectable in the serum of most calves prior to challenge, to greater than 1 mgml−1 in over one-third of the calves at the height of disease. Furthermore, the concentration of haptoglobin was associated significantly with other measures of the severity of disease. Together, these results indicate that quantification of acute phase proteins in animals with BRD could be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic aid.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
