Their chemical structures were elucidated by spectral studies. Cytotoxicity and antiviral activity were evaluated against herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS), herpes simplex virus-2 (G), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus-1 TK- KOS ACVr, para influenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, Punta Toro virus, feline corona virus (FIPV), feline herpes virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A H1N1 subtype, influenza A H3N2 subtype, and influenza B virus. Compound 2a showed better antiviral activity against the entire tested virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
