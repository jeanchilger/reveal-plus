This type of classification is helpful for selection of lectins as structural probes in biomedical applications. This chapter summarizes the concept and the updated information regarding the specificity-based lectin classification. Lectins are functionally classified based on their relative binding reactivities with the structural units of carbohydrate or glyco-epitopes. They are grouped according to their monosaccharide specificities and then further sub-grouped based on their reactivities with more complex structures. Carbohydrate specificities of biomedically important lectins are classified into six groups according to their specificities to monosaccharides. The chapter introduces a practical platform of carbohydrate microarrays that is useful for lectin characterization and classification. Finally, the chapter discusses a few examples to illustrate the application of this technology in lectin-related experimental investigations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
