However, the fact that T cell activity is frequently downregulated during pathogen-directed responses suggests a pivotal physiological role of co-inhibitory pathways during infectious disease. Reports of exacerbated immunopathology in conditions of impaired co-inhibition foster the view that downregulation of T cell activity is an essential negative feedback mechanism that protects from excessive pathogen-directed immunity. Thus, targeting co-inhibitory pathways can bear detrimental potential through the deregulation of physiological processes. Here, we summarize recent preclinical and clinical interventions that report immune-related adverse events after targeting co-inhibitory pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
