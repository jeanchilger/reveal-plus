<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-06-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Ubiquitination, Ubiquitin-like Modifiers, and Deubiquitination in Viral Infection</TITLE><BODY>Ubiquitin is important for nearly every aspect of cellular physiology. All viruses rely extensively on host machinery for replication; therefore, it is not surprising that viruses connect to the ubiquitin pathway at many levels. Viral involvement with ubiquitin occurs either adventitiously because of the unavoidable usurpation of cellular processes, or for some specific purpose selected for by the virus to enhance viral replication. Here, we review current knowledge of how the ubiquitin pathway alters viral replication and how viruses influence the ubiquitin pathway to enhance their own replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
