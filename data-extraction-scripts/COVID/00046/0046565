Our mathematical formulation is based on the fractional Caputo derivative. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is discussed. Furthermore, numerical solution is studied by variational iteration method and Euler method. Consequently, some numerical results are presented within.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
