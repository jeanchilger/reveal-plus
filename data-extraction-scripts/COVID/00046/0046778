The analysis of the S1 gene has been used to determine IBV genotype. The aim of this study was genotyping of IBVs circulating among the Iranian broiler flocks in the period between 2015 to 2017. Trachea samples from 278 broiler flocks were collected from broiler farms in eight provinces of Iran. After Real-time RT-PCR, IBV-positive samples were further characterized based on S1 gene. The results of the Real-time RT-PCR showed that 52.16% of flocks were IBV positive. Four genotypes were detected and the frequency of occurrence rates of IS-1494-like, 793/B, QX and Massachusetts IBV genotypes were 70.34%, 19.31%, 7.58% and 2.75%, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that nucleotide identities within IS-1494-like group ranged between 98.86–100%, while each of the QX, Massachusetts and 793/B groups were 98.05–100%, 98.20–100% and 93.29–100% respectively. These results show that the IS-1494-like IBV is the dominant IBV genotype in Iran. Proper control strategies are essential to overcoming the high frequency of occurrence of IS-1494-like IBV. The phylogenetic relationship of the strains with respect to different sequences and geographical regions displayed complexity and diversity. Further studies are needed and should include the isolation and full-length molecular characterization of IBV in Iran.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
