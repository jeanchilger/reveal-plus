Following that, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) has recently emerged, killing about 36% of patients infected globally, mainly in Saudi Arabia and South Korea. Based on a scaffold we reported for inhibiting neuraminidase (NA), we synthesized the analogues and identified compounds with low micromolar inhibitory activity against 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Docking studies show that a carboxylate present at either R(1) or R(4) destabilizes the oxyanion hole in the 3CL(pro). Interestingly, 3f, 3g and 3m could inhibit both NA and 3CL(pro) and serve as a starting point to develop broad-spectrum antiviral agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
