<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-11-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Aspergillus meningitis: A rare clinical manifestation of central nervous system aspergillosis. Case report and review of 92 cases</TITLE><BODY>OBJECTIVES: To describe the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, cerebrospinal fluid findings and outcome of Aspergillus meningitis, meningoencephalitis and arachnoiditis. METHODS: A case of Aspergillus meningitis is described. A comprehensive review of the English-language literature was conducted to identify all reported cases of Aspergillus meningitis described between January 1973 and December 2011. RESULTS: Ninety-three cases (including the one described herein) of Aspergillus meningitis were identified. Fifty-two (55.9%) were in individuals without any predisposing factor or known causes of immunosuppression. Acute and chronic meningitis was diagnosed in 65.6% of patients and meningoencephalitis in 24.7% of them with the remaining presenting with spinal arachnoiditis and ventriculitis. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for Aspergillus spp. were positive in about 31% of cases and the galactomannan antigen test in 87%. Diagnosis during life was achieved in 52 patients (55.9%) with a case fatality rate of 50%. The overall case fatality rate was 72.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Aspergillus meningitis may occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients and run an acute or chronic course. The findings of this systematic review extend the information on this life-threatening infection and could assist physicians in achieving an improved outcome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
