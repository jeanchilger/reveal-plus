<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-09-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Survey of acute hospital infection control resources and services in the Republic of Ireland</TITLE><BODY>Summary Following the development of national guidelines on the control of antimicrobial resistance in 2001, a survey was carried out in 2003 of all 68 acute hospitals in the Republic of Ireland on resources available and current practice to control and prevent nosocomial infection. Completed questionnaires were received from 66 hospitals (97%). The median number of acute inpatient beds per hospital was 156; this was 522 in regional/tertiary referral centres. Only 31 (47%) hospitals had on-site consultant microbiologist sessions, and there was an infection control nurse in 56 (85%) hospitals. Eighteen (29%) hospitals had an occupational health physician, and 48 (73%) hospitals had an infection control committee. There was a median of one isolation room for every 16 acute beds, and a median of five rooms with en-suite bathroom facilities per hospital in those hospitals that provided data. All hospitals had documented infection control policies, and these were available in electronic format in 25 (38%) hospitals. Fifty-five (83%) hospitals undertook surveillance of nosocomial infection, and alcohol-based hand hygiene facilities were available, either at a handwashing sink or at the entrance to a ward, in 57 (86%) hospitals. In the Republic of Ireland, there remains a significant shortage of microbiologists/infection control doctors, occupational health physicians and infection control nurses. Isolation facilities are also inadequate. Although there is much agreement internationally on the importance of nosocomial infection and the priorities for surveillance, there are no agreed basic minimum standards for the resources and facilities necessary to control and prevent nosocomial infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
