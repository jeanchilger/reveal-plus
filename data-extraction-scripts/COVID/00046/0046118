However, studies on the role of these viruses in asthmatic patients in the interval between exacerbations are sparse. This study aimed to determine the presence of respiratory viruses, without symptoms of infection, in the airways of young asthmatics as compared to healthy controls. Material and Methods Patients 10–35 years of age with stable asthma and a group of healthy controls were analyzed regarding the presence of RNA from common respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates by PCR. Self-reported asthma control and quality of life, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), spirometry, and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine were recorded. Blood samples were collected to assess IgE sensitisation and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels. Results In 354 patients with asthma and 108 healthy controls, human rhinovirus (HRV) was the only virus detected (4.5% of asthmatics vs. 0.9% of controls; p = 0.08). HRV+ asthma patients had a higher degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation (median 37.7 vs. 10.4 kUA/L, p = 0.04), and a tendency for higher levels of serum ECP (median 17.2 vs. 12.6 μg/L, p = 0.07), as compared to their HRV− counterparts. Conclusions Absence of symptoms of respiratory tract infection notwithstanding, HRV seems to be more prevalent in the airways of adolescents and young adults with asthma and a high degree of aeroallergen IgE sensitisation than in controls. The presence of HRV seems also to be related to systemic eosinophilic inflammation despite ongoing treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
