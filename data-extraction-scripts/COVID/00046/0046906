<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-10-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Nasal Vaccine Delivery</TITLE><BODY>The mucosal surfaces represent the major site of entry of many pathogens, and major challenges in vaccine development include safety and stability in a suitable dosage form. Micro- and nanocarrier-based delivery systems as nasal vaccines induce humoral, cellular, and mucosal immunity. The nasal route of vaccination could also offer immunity at several distant mucosal sites (oral, rectal, vaginal, and pulmonary), which is considered a simplified and cost-effective mode of vaccination with enhanced patient compliance. Most of the nasal vaccine delivery systems in the form of microparticulates, nanoparticulates, and liposomes are currently under development and prove to offer immunity in animal models. The importance and potential of the nasal route of administration for vaccines is unexplored, and this chapter outlines the opportunities, challenges, and potential delivery solutions to facilitate the development of improved nasal vaccines for infectious diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
