This has led some investigators to hypothesize that such illnesses may also have disruptive effects on sleep. While several self-report studies suggest that viral illness may influence sleep parameters, no studies have assessed polysomnographically recorded sleep following viral infections. Design: Parallel control group comparison. Setting: Sleep laboratory in a large urban medical center. Participants: Twenty-one men and women with susceptibility to the rhinovirus type 23. Interventions: Nasal inoculation with rhinovirus type 23. Measurements: Polysomnographically recorded sleep for five nights (2300–0700 h) post-viral inoculation. Twice daily (1030 and 1430 h) performance assessment during each experimental day using auditory vigilance and divided attention tasks. A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was performed daily for the duration of the study. Results: In symptomatic individuals, total sleep time decreased an average of 23 min, consolidated sleep decreased an average of 36 min, and sleep efficiency was reduced by an average of 5% during the active viral period (experimental days/nights 3–5) compared with the incubation period. Psychomotor performance was impaired. These changes were significantly greater than those observed in asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: The common cold can have detrimental effects on sleep and psychomotor performance in symptomatic individuals during the initial active phase of the illness.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
