<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1976-07-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Variant Infectious Bronchitis Virus Isolated From Indiana Chickens</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) associated with a catarrhal tracheitis, sudden decline in egg production, and reduced shell quality was isolated from an Indiana White Leghorn breeder flock. It was found to be serologically different from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa 97, Iowa 609, Florida, Arkansas 99, JMK, Holte, Gray and SE 17 IBV serotypes. Two different Massachusetts vaccine strains protected chickens from respiratory signs but not against virus infection using the isolant for challenge in laboratory trials. The isolant was passed through a 0.22 μ. filter. It was heat (56° C), acid pH (3.0), ether and chloroform labile. In embryos it produced deaths or lesions of infectious bronchitis in one to five days after inoculation. It is suggested that this IBV isolant be designated Indiana-type.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
