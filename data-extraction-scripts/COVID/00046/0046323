Diseases reviewed comprise those due to lentiviruses of equine infectious anaemia, visna/maedi and caprine arthritis encephalitis and feline immunodeficiency. Diseases caused by viruses of feline infectious peritonitis, feline leukaemia, canine distemper and aquatic counterparts, Aleutian disease and malignant catarrhal fever. We also consider prospects of immunoprophylaxis for the diseases and briefly other control measures. It should be realised that the outlook for effective vaccines for many of the diseases is remote. This paper describes the current status of vaccine research and the difficulties encountered during their development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
