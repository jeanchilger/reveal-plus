We performed a retrospective study to compare the Cepheid Xpress Flu/RSV assay with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay, using laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) as the reference method. The Xpress assay was 100% accurate compared to LDTs, whereas the Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay was 96.0% accurate. The Xpress test was determined to be faster and more sensitive than the XC assay.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
