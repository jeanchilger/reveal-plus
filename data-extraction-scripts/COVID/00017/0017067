<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-07-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Amicus or Adversary Revisited: Platelets in Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</TITLE><BODY>Platelets are essential cellular effectors of hemostasis and contribute to disease as circulating effectors of pathologic thrombosis. These are their most widely known biologic activities. Nevertheless, recent observations demonstrate that platelets have a much more intricate repertoire beyond these traditional functions and that they are specialized for contributions to vascular barrier integrity, organ repair, antimicrobial host defense, inflammation, and activities across the immune continuum. Paradoxically, on the basis of clinical investigations and animal models of disease, some of these newly discovered activities of platelets appear to contribute to tissue injury. Studies in the last decade indicate unique interactions of platelets and their precursor, the megakaryocyte, in the lung and implicate platelets as essential effectors in experimental acute lung injury and clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome. Additional discoveries derived from evolving work will be required to precisely define the contributions of platelets to complex subphenotypes of acute lung injury and to determine if these remarkable and versatile blood cells are therapeutic targets in acute respiratory distress syndrome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
