Type III IFNs were originally identified as a novel ligand-receptor system acting in parallel with type I IFNs, but subsequent studies have provided increasing evidence for distinct roles for each IFN family. In addition to their compartmentalized antiviral actions, these two systems appear to have multiple levels of cross-regulation and act coordinately to achieve effective antimicrobial protection with minimal collateral damage to the host.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
