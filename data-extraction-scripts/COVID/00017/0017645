A strong antiviral response to the viral surface glycoprotein (SU) was noted in both natural and experimental infections. In addition, 143 of 226 FIV-infected animals (63%) also expressed antibodies to the primary binding receptor, CD134, whereas cats infected with other feline RNA viruses, including calicivirus, coronavirus, herpesvirus, and feline leukemia virus, did not. Both affinity-purified anti-CD134 and anti-SU antibodies blocked FIV infection ex vivo. FACS analyses revealed that the anti-CD134 antibodies bound to a cryptic epitope on the receptor that was only exposed when SU bound to CD134. Anti-CD134 binding caused displacement of SU from the surface of the cell and inhibition of infection. The presence of antibodies to CD134 correlated with lower virus loads and a better overall health status in FIV(+) cats, whereas anti-SU antibodies were present independent of health status. The findings are consistent with a role for antireceptor antibodies in protection from virus spread and disease progression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
