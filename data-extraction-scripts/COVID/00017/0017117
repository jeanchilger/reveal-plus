But antigenic reactivity is only one of the properties required to induce a protective immune response. Here, a multidimensional approach is used to exemplify the enabling role atomic-level information can play in the development of immunogens against three viral pathogens, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which have resisted standard approaches to vaccine development. Overall, structure-based strategies incorporating B-cell ontogenies and viral evasion mechanisms appear exceptionally powerful.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
