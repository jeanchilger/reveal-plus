Herein we show that axonal damage occurred in areas of demyelination and also in adjacent areas devoid of myelin damage. Immunodeficient MHV-infected RAG1−/− mice (mice defective in recombinase activating gene 1 expression) do not develop demyelination unless they receive splenocytes from a mouse previously immunized against MHV (G. F. Wu, A. Dandekar, L. Pewe, and S. Perlman, J. Immunol. 165:2278–2286, 2000). In the present study, we show that adoptive transfer of T cells was also required for the majority of the axonal injury observed in these animals. Both demyelination and axonal damage were apparent by 7 days posttransfer. Recent data suggest that axonal injury is a major factor in the long-term disability observed in patients with multiple sclerosis. Our data demonstrate that immune system-mediated damage to axons is also a common feature in mice with MHV-induced demyelination. Remarkably, there appeared to be a minimal, if any, interval of time between the appearance of demyelination and that of axonal injury.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
