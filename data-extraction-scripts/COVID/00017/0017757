Instillation of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a positive-strand RNA virus) into the CNS of mice results in acute encephalitis followed by a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease. Antibody-mediated blocking of either IL-23 (anti-IL-23p19) or IL-12 and IL-23 (anti-IL-12/23p40) signaling did not mute T-cell trafficking into the CNS or antiviral effector responses and mice were able to control viral replication within the brain. Therapeutic administration of either anti-IL-23p19 or anti-IL-12/23p40 to mice with viral-induced demyelination did not attenuate T-cell or macrophage infiltration into the CNS nor improve clinical disease or diminish white matter damage. In contrast, treatment of mice with anti-IL-12/23p40 or anti-IL-23p19 resulted in inhibition of the autoimmune model of demyelination, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These data indicate that (1) IL-12 and IL-23 signaling are dispensable in generating a protective T-cell response following CNS infection with MHV, and (2) IL-12 and IL-23 do not contribute to demyelination in a model independent of autoimmune T-cell–mediated pathology. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of IL-12 and/or IL-23 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases may offer unique advantages by reducing disease severity without muting protective responses following viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
