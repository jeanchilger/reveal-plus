<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-04-06</DATELINE><TITLE>An Improved Ward Architecture for Treatment of Patients with Ebola Virus Disease in Liberia</TITLE><BODY>During the recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in west Africa, we established an Ebola treatment center (ETC) with improved ward architecture. The ETC was built with movable prefabricated boards according to infectious disease unit standard requirements. The clinical staff ensured their own security while providing patients with effective treatment. Of the 180 admissions to the ETC, 10 cases were confirmed with EVD of which six patients survived. None of the clinical staff was infected. We hope that our experience will enable others to avoid unnecessary risks while delivering EVD care.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
