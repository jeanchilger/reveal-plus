However, strategies for incorporating multiple antigens into a single vector and the immunization routes may affect their immunogenicity. In this study, we utilized recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) as a model vaccine vector, and Ag85A (Rv3804c) and Mtb32 (Rv0125) as model antigens, to comparatively evaluate the influence of codon usage optimization, signal sequence, fusion linkers, and immunization routes on the immunogenicity of tuberculosis (TB) vaccine containing multiple antigens in C57BL/6 mice. We showed that codon-optimized Ag85A and Mtb32 fused with a GSG linker induced the strongest systemic and pulmonary cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. Strong CMI responses were characterized by the generation of a robust IFN-γ ELISPOT response as well as antigen-specific CD4(+) T and CD8(+) T cells, which secreted mono-, dual-, or multiple cytokines. We also found that subcutaneous (SC) and intranasal (IN)/oral immunization with this candidate vaccine exhibited the strongest boosting effects for Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-primed systemic and pulmonary CMI responses, respectively. Our results supported that codon optimized Ag85A and Mtb32 fused with a proper linker and immunized through SC and IN/oral routes can generate the strongest systemic and pulmonary CMI responses in BCG-primed mice, which may be particularly important for the design of TB vaccines containing multiple antigens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
