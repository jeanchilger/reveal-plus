They are of positive polarity and are translated to produce the viral proteins needed for the assembly of an active replicase-transcriptase complex. In addition to replicating the genomic RNA, a key feature of this complex is a unique transcription process that results in the synthesis of a nested set of six to eight subgenomic mRNAs. These subgenomic mRNAs are produced in constant but nonequimolar amounts and, in general, each is translated to produce a single protein. To take advantage of these features, we have developed a multigene expression vector based on human coronavirus 229E. We have constructed a prototype RNA vector containing the 5′ and 3′ ends of the human coronavirus genome, the entire human coronavirus replicase gene, and three reporter genes (i.e., the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [CAT] gene, the firefly luciferase [LUC] gene, and the green fluorescent protein [GFP] gene). Each reporter gene is located downstream of a human coronavirus transcription-associated sequence, which is required for the synthesis of individual subgenomic mRNAs. The transfection of vector RNA and human coronavirus nucleocapsid protein mRNA into BHK-21 cells resulted in the expression of the CAT, LUC, and GFP reporter proteins. Sequence analysis confirmed the synthesis of coronavirus-specific mRNAs encoding CAT, LUC, and GFP. In addition, we have shown that human coronavirus-based vector RNA can be packaged into virus-like particles that, in turn, can be used to transduce immature and mature human dendritic cells. In summary, we describe a new class of eukaryotic, multigene expression vectors that are based on the human coronavirus 229E and have the ability to transduce human dendritic cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
