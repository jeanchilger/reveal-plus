The protein is encoded by one of the so-called group-specific genes and has no sequence homology with any of the known structural or group-specific proteins of coronaviruses. It does, however, have several similarities to the coronavirus M proteins; (i) they are triple membrane spanning with the same topology, (ii) they have similar intracellular localizations (predominantly Golgi), (iii) both are viral structural proteins, and (iv) they appear to interact with the E and S proteins, as well as with each other. The M protein plays a crucial role in coronavirus assembly and is glycosylated in all coronaviruses, either by N-linked or by O-linked oligosaccharides. The conserved glycosylation of the coronavirus M proteins and the resemblance of the 3a protein to them led us to investigate the glycosylation of these two SARS-CoV membrane proteins. The proteins were expressed separately using the vaccinia virus T7 expression system, followed by metabolic labeling. Pulse-chase analysis showed that both proteins were modified, although in different ways. While the M protein acquired cotranslationally oligosaccharides that could be removed by PNGaseF, the 3a protein acquired its modifications posttranslationally, and they were not sensitive to the N-glycosidase enzyme. The SARS-CoV 3a protein, however, was demonstrated to contain sialic acids, indicating the presence of oligosaccharides. O-glycosylation of the 3a protein was indeed confirmed using an in situ O-glycosylation assay of endoplasmic reticulum-retained mutants. In addition, we showed that substitution of serine and threonine residues in the ectodomain of the 3a protein abolished the addition of the O-linked sugars. Thus, the SARS-CoV 3a protein is an O-glycosylated glycoprotein, like the group 2 coronavirus M proteins but unlike the SARS-CoV M protein, which is N glycosylated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
