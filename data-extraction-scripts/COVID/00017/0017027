METHODS: One hundred and eighty-two patients with SARS were employed in a retrospective study that investigated hepatic dysfunction. Liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were analyzed in these patients. Patients with different hospital treatments were further investigated. RESULTS: Of the 182 patients, 128 (70.3%) had abnormal ALT activity, 57 (31.3%) had abnormal AST activity and 87 (47.8%) had abnormal LDH activity. The peak of elevated hepatic enzyme activities occurred between the sixth day and the tenth day after the first day of reported fever. Of the 182 patients, 160 (87.9%) had been treated with antibiotics, 137 (75.2%) with Ribavirin, and 115 (63.2%) with methylpredisolone. There was no statistically significant correlation between the duration of Ribavirin treatement and hepatic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Abnormal liver functions were common in patients with SARS and could be associated with virus replication in the liver.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
