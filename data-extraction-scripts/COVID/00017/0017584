<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-02-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Characterization of a Vesivirus Associated with an Outbreak of Acute Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis in Domestic Dogs</TITLE><BODY>Four of eleven affected dogs died despite aggressive treatment during a 2015 focal outbreak of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis following a stay in a pet housing facility. Routine diagnostic investigations failed to identify a specific cause. Virus isolation from fresh necropsy tissues yielded a calicivirus with sequence homology to a vesivirus within the group colloquially known as the vesivirus 2117 strains that were originally identified as contaminants in CHO cell bioreactors. In situ hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR assays of tissues from the four deceased dogs confirmed the presence of canine vesivirus (CaVV) nucleic acids that localized to endothelial cells of arterial and capillary blood vessels. CaVV nucleic acid corresponded to areas of necrosis and hemorrhage primarily in the intestinal tract, but also in the brain of one dog with nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis. This is the first report of an atypical disease association with a putative hypervirulent vesivirus strain in dogs, as all other known strains of CaVV appear to cause nonclinical infections or relatively mild disease. After identification of the CU-296 vesivirus strain from this outbreak, four additional CaVV strains were amplified from unrelated fecal specimens and archived stocks provided by other laboratories. Broader questions include the origins, reservoir(s), and potential for reemergence and spread of these related CaVVs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
