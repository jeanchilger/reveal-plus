Here we explored the epidemiology and etiology of two adenovirus serotype 3 outbreaks in Hangzhou in 2011. One acute respiratory outbreak was found in Chun'an County, where a total of 371 cases were confirmed in 5 of 23 towns from 4 to 31 May 2011. The outbreak affected 18.57% (13/70) of schools and 14.49% (90/621) of classes. The incidence was 5.18% (371/7,163). The population was distributed among individuals ages 7 to 15 years. No parents or teachers were infected. Another pharyngoconjunctival fever outbreak was discovered in the Chenjinglun Swimming Center located in the Xihu District between 1 and 15 July 2011. A total of 134 cases were confirmed in 900 amateur swimmers, with an incidence of 14.89% (134/900). The ages ranged from 4 to 9 years. The two outbreaks had no severe complications or death. The viruses in 66.67% (10/15) of throat swabs from children with acute respiratory infections and 100% (10/10) of the swabs from children with pharyngoconjunctival fever were confirmed to be adenovirus serotype 3 with 100% homology by PCR. Of these samples, 60.0% (12/20) had a classical characteristic cytopathic effect, presented as grape-like clusters at 72 h after infection in HEp-2 cells. In conclusion, the acute respiratory infection and pharyngoconjunctival fever outbreak in Hangzhou were caused by the completely homologous type 3 adenovirus in subgenus B. Moreover, these outbreaks demonstrated rapid transmission rates, possibly due to close contact and droplet transmission.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
