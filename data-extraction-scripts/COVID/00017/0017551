These actions are coordinated through integrated actions in the kidney, cardio-vascular system and the central nervous system. Along with its impact on blood pressure, the renin-angiotensin system also influences a range of processes from inflammation and immune responses to longevity. Here, we review the actions of the “classical” renin-angiotensin system, whereby the substrate protein angiotensinogen is processed in a two-step reaction by renin and angiotensin converting enzyme, resulting in the sequential generation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, the major biologically active renin-angiotensin system peptide, which exerts its actions via type 1 and type 2 angiotensin receptors. In recent years, several new enzymes, peptides, and receptors related to the renin-angiotensin system have been identified, manifesting a complexity that was previously unappreciated. While the functions of these alternative pathways will be reviewed elsewhere in this journal, our focus here is on the physiological role of components of the “classical” renin-angiotensin system, with an emphasis on new developments and modern concepts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
