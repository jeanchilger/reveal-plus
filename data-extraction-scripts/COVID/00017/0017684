<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-01</DATELINE><TITLE>The National Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control (NAC-IPC)</TITLE><BODY>This paper describes the work of the National Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control (NAC-IPC), previously Infection Prevention and Control Expert Working Group, a longstanding external advisory body that provides subject matter expertise and advice to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) on the prevention and control of infectious diseases in Canadian health care settings. Originally established by Health Canada as the Infection Control Guidelines Steering Committee in 1992, this advisory board has been providing expert advice on infection prevention and control (IPC) guideline development for over 25 years. The NAC-IPC provides advice to inform the development of comprehensive or concise guidelines, quick reference guides and interim guidelines (usually for emerging pathogens), working closely with PHAC’s national Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) surveillance programs for Canadian health care facilities. PHAC’s HAI-IPC professionals conduct the necessary literature research, data extraction, evidence synthesis, evidence grading (where applicable) and scientific writing for the guidelines. Due to the paucity of clinical trials and high quality observational studies to inform recommendations for emerging pathogens, expert opinion is critical for interpreting available evidence. .&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
