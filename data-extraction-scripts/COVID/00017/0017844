Current therapy is expensive, associated with significant side effects, and often ineffective. Discovery of antiviral compounds against HCV traditionally involves a priori target identification followed by biochemical screening and confirmation in cell-based replicon assays. Typically, this results in the discovery of compounds that address a few predetermined targets and are prone to select for escape variants. To attempt to identify antiviral compounds with broad target specificity, we developed an unbiased cell-based screening system involving multiple rounds of infection in a 96-well format. Analysis of a publicly available library of 446 clinically approved drugs identified 33 compounds that targeted both known and previously unexplored aspects of HCV infection, including entry, replication, and assembly. Discovery of novel viral and cellular targets in this manner will broaden the therapeutic armamentarium against this virus, allowing for the development of drug mixtures that should reduce the likelihood of mutational escape.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
