The great impact of EV71 and HCV on public health highlights the need to further our understanding of the biology of these two viruses and develop effective therapeutic antivirals. Here, we evaluated a total of 32 lycorine derivatives and demonstrated that 1-acetyllycorine suppressed the proliferation of multiple strains of EV71 in various cells. The results of the drug resistance analysis revealed that 1-acetyllycorine targeted a phenylalanine (F76) in EV71 2A protease (2A(pro)) to stabilize the conformation of a unique zinc finger. Most interestingly, the zinc binding site in EV71 2A(pro) is the exclusive homolog of HCV NS3 among all viruses. Further analysis revealed that 1-acetyllycorine also inhibits HCV with high efficacy, and the mutation on R118 in HCV NS3, which corresponds to F76 in EV71 2A(pro), confers the resistance of HCV to 1-acetyllycorine. These results revealed a conserved mechanism of 1-acetyllycorine against EV71 and HCV through targeting viral proteases. We also documented the significant synergistic anti-EV71 and anti-HCV effects of 1-acetyllycorine with reported inhibitors, supporting potential combination therapy for the treatment of EV71 and HCV infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
