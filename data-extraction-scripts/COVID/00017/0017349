<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-01-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Protein production and purification</TITLE><BODY>In selecting a method to produce a recombinant protein, a researcher is faced with a bewildering array of choices as to where to start. To facilitate decision-making, we describe a consensus ‘what to try first’ strategy based on our collective analysis of the expression and purification of over 10,000 different proteins.
