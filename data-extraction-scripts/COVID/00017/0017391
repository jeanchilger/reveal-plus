A tremendous amount of work has been accumulating to decipher the RNA moieties required for an RLR agonist, the signal transduction pathway leading to activation of the innate immunity orchestrated by type I interferon (IFN), the cellular and viral regulators of this pathway, and the viral inhibitors of the innate immune response. Previous reviews have focused on the RLR signaling pathway and on the negative regulation of the interferon response by viral proteins. The focus of this review is to put this knowledge in the context of the virus replication cycle within a cell. Likewise, there has been an expansion of knowledge about the role of innate immunity in the pathophysiology of viral infection. As a consequence, some discrepancies have arisen between the current models of cell-intrinsic innate immunity and current knowledge of virus biology. This holds particularly true for the nonsegmented negative-strand viruses (Mononegavirales), which paradoxically have been largely used to build presently available models. The aim of this review is to bridge the gap between the virology and innate immunity to favor the rational building of a relevant model(s) describing the interplay between Mononegavirales and the innate immune system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
