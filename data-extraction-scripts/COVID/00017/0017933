Panviral DNA microarrays represent the most robust approach for massively parallel viral surveillance and detection. The Virochip is a panviral DNA microarray that is capable of detecting all known viruses, as well as novel viruses related to known viral families, in a single assay and has been used to successfully identify known and novel viral agents in clinical human specimens. However, the usefulness and the sensitivity of the Virochip platform have not been tested on a set of clinical veterinary specimens with the high degree of genetic variance that is frequently observed with swine virus field isolates. In this report, we investigate the utility and sensitivity of the Virochip to positively detect swine viruses in both cell culture-derived samples and clinical swine samples. The Virochip successfully detected porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in serum containing 6.10 × 10(2) viral copies per microliter and influenza A virus in lung lavage fluid containing 2.08 × 10(6) viral copies per microliter. The Virochip also successfully detected porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in serum containing 2.50 × 10(8) viral copies per microliter and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) in turbinate tissue homogenate. Collectively, the data in this report demonstrate that the Virochip can successfully detect pathogenic viruses frequently found in swine in a variety of solid and liquid specimens, such as turbinate tissue homogenate and lung lavage fluid, as well as antemortem samples, such as serum.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
