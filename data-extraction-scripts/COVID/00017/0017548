Here we show that SARS-CoV could inhibit both virus- and interferon (IFN)-dependent signaling, two key steps of the antiviral response. We mapped a strong inhibitory activity to SARS-CoV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and show that expression of nsp1 significantly inhibited the activation of all three virus-dependent signaling pathways. We show that expression of nsp1 significantly inhibited IFN-dependent signaling by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT1 while having little effect on those of STAT2, JAK1, and TYK2. We engineered an attenuated mutant of nsp1 in SARS-CoV through reverse genetics, and the resulting mutant virus was viable and replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus in cells with a defective IFN response. However, mutant virus replication was strongly attenuated in cells with an intact IFN response. Thus, nsp1 is likely a virulence factor that contributes to pathogenicity by favoring SARS-CoV replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
