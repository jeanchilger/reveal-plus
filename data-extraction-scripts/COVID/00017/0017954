Most eukaryotic viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, including coronaviruses, have evolved strategies to cap their RNAs. In this report, we used a yeast genetic system to functionally screen for the cap-forming enzymes encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and identified the nonstructural protein (nsp) 14 of SARS coronavirus as a (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) in vivo in yeast cells and in vitro using purified enzymes and RNA substrates. Interestingly, coronavirus nsp14 was previously characterized as a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease, and by mutational analysis, we mapped the N7-MTase domain to the carboxy-terminal part of nsp14 that shows features conserved with cellular N7-MTase in structure-based sequence alignment. The exoribonuclease active site was dispensable but the exoribonuclease domain was required for N7-MTase activity. Such combination of the 2 functional domains in coronavirus nsp14 suggests that it may represent a novel form of RNA-processing enzymes. Mutational analysis in a replicon system showed that the N7-MTase activity was important for SARS virus replication/transcription and can thus be used as an attractive drug target to develop antivirals for control of coronaviruses including the deadly SARS virus. Furthermore, the observation that the N7-MTase of RNA life could function in lieu of that in DNA life provides interesting evolutionary insight and practical possibilities in antiviral drug screening.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
