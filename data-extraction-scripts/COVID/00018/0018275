<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-06-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Characterization of the Bas-Congo Virus Glycoprotein and Its Function in Pseudotyped Viruses</TITLE><BODY>Bas-Congo virus (BASV) is a novel rhabdovirus recently identified from a patient with acute hemorrhagic fever in the Bas-Congo province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Here we show that the BASV glycoprotein (BASV-G) can be successfully used to pseudotype glycoprotein-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), allowing studies of BASV-G-driven membrane fusion and viral entry into target cells without replication-competent virus. BASV-G displayed broad tissue and species tropism in vitro, and BASV-G-mediated membrane fusion was pH dependent. The conformational changes induced in BASV-G by acidification were fully reversible and did not lead to inactivation of the viral fusion protein. Our data combined with comparative sequence similarity analyses suggest that BASV-G shares structural and functional features with other rhabdovirus glycoproteins and falls into the group of class III viral fusion proteins. However, activation of BASV-G-driven fusion required a lower pH and higher temperatures than did VSV-G-mediated fusion. Moreover, in contrast to VSV-G, mature BASV-G in VSV pseudotypes consists of a mixture of high-mannose and complex glycans that enables it to bind to certain C-type lectins, thereby enhancing its attachment to target cells. Taken together, the results presented in this study will facilitate future investigations of BASV-G-mediated cell entry and its inhibition in the absence of an infectious cell culture assay for BASV and at lower biosafety levels. Moreover, serology testing based on BASV-G pseudotype neutralization can be used to uncover the prevalence and importance of BASV as a potential novel human pathogen in the DRC and throughout Central Africa.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
