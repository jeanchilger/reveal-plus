A reverse genetics system of PRRSV North American prototype VR-2332 was developed to explore the importance of different regions of nsp2 for viral replication. A series of mutants with in-frame deletions in the nsp2 coding region were engineered, and infectious viruses were subsequently recovered from transfected cells and further characterized. The results demonstrated that the cysteine protease domain (PL2), the PL2 downstream flanking sequence (amino acids [aa] 181 to 323), and the putative transmembrane domain were critical for replication. In contrast, the segment of nsp2 preceding the PL2 domain (aa 13 to 35) was dispensable for viral replication, and the nsp2 middle hypervariable region (aa 324 to 813) tolerated 100-aa or 200-aa deletions but could not be removed as a whole; the largest deletion was about 400 aa (nsp2Δ324-726). Characterization of the mutants demonstrated that those with small deletions possessed growth kinetics and RNA expression profiles similar to those of the parental virus, while the nsp2Δ324-726 mutant displayed decreased cytolytic activity on MARC-145 cells and did not develop visible plaques. Finally, the utilization of the genetic flexibility of nsp2 to express foreign genes was examined by inserting the gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) in frame into one nsp2 deletion mutant construct. The recombinant virus was viable but impaired and unstable and gradually gained parental growth kinetics by the loss of most of the GFP gene.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
