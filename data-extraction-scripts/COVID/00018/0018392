An early lytic gene of KSHV encodes vIL-6, a viral homolog of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and an autocrine/paracrine growth factor human interleukin 6. In this study, we examined the effects of suppressing vIL-6 expression in PEL cells with antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO). PPMO are single-stranded DNA analogues that have a modified backbone and enter cells readily. Treatment of PEL cells with a PPMO designed against vIL-6 mRNA led to a marked reduction in the proportion of vIL-6-positive cells detected by immunofluorescence assay. Analysis by Western blot confirmed a specific reduction in the vIL-6 protein level, and demonstrated that the reduction was dependent on the dose of vIL-6 PPMO. PEL cells treated with the vIL-6 PPMO exhibited reduced levels of cellular growth, IL-6 expression and KSHV DNA, as well as an elevated level of p21 protein. Treatment of PEL cells with a combination of two vIL-6 PPMO compounds targeting different sequences in the vIL-6 mRNA led to an inhibitory effect that was greater than that achieved with either PPMO alone. These results demonstrate that PPMO targeting vIL-6 mRNA can potently reduce vIL-6 protein translation, and indicate that further exploration of these compounds in an animal model for potential clinical application is warranted.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
