The amino acid residue at the P6 position of the HA cleavage site (HACS) has been shown to be most variable and to have a direct correlation with the cleavage efficiency and pathogenicity of H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in mammals. Among these amino acid variants, serine has been associated with the highest virulence in mammals, and its detection may serve as an indicator for H5N1 AIVs with high pathogenicity and potential public risk. We developed a rapid detection method based on reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR and pyrosequencing to detect a mutation at the HACS that is associated with increased pathogenicity of H5N1 AIVs in mammals. Herein, we provide a specific, sensitive, and reliable method for rapid detection of one of the virulence determinants associated with increased pathogenicity of H5N1 AIVs in mammals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
