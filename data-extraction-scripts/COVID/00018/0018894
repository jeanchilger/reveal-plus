In mice infected with glia-tropic demyelinating coronavirus, B7-H1 expression on oligodendroglia delays virus control, but also dampens clinical disease. To define the mechanisms by which B7-H1 alters pathogenic outcome, virus infected B7-H1 deficient (B7-H1(-/-)) mice were analyzed for altered peripheral and CNS immune responses. B7-H1 deficiency did not affect peripheral T or B cell activation, nor alter the magnitude or composition of CNS infiltrating cells. However, higher levels of IFN-γ mRNA in CNS infiltrating virus-specific CD8 T cells as well as CD4 T cells contributed to elevated IFN-γ protein in the B7-H1(-/-) CNS. Increased effector function at the single cell level was also evident by elevated granzyme B expression specifically in virus-specific CNS CD8 T cells. Although enhanced T cell activity accelerated virus control, 50% of mice succumbed to infection. Despite enhanced clinical recovery, surviving B7-H1(-/-) mice still harbored persisting viral mRNA, albeit at reduced levels compared to wild-type mice. B7-H1(-/-)mice exhibited extensive loss of axonal integrity although demyelination, a hallmark of virus induced tissue damage, was not increased. The results suggest that B7-H1 hinders viral control in B7-H1 expressing glia cells, but does not mediate resistance to CD8 T cell-mediated cytolysis. These data are the first to demonstrate that B7-H1-mediated protection from viral induced immune pathology associated with encephalomyelitis resides in limiting T cell-mediated axonal bystander damage, rather than direct elimination of infected myelinating cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
