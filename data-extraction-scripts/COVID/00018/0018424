SARS-CoV mediates receptor binding and entry by its spike (S) glycoprotein, and infection is sensitive to lysosomotropic agents that perturb endosomal pH. We demonstrate here that the lysosomotropic-agent-mediated block to SARS-CoV infection is overcome by protease treatment of target-cell-associated virus. In addition, SARS-CoV infection was blocked by specific inhibitors of the pH-sensitive endosomal protease cathepsin L. A cell-free membrane-fusion system demonstrates that engagement of receptor followed by proteolysis is required for SARS-CoV membrane fusion and indicates that cathepsin L is sufficient to activate membrane fusion by SARS-CoV S. These results suggest that SARS-CoV infection results from a unique, three-step process: receptor binding and induced conformational changes in S glycoprotein followed by cathepsin L proteolysis within endosomes. The requirement for cathepsin L proteolysis identifies a previously uncharacterized class of inhibitor for SARS-CoV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
