Alternative screening approaches for antivirals against the recently emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) may provide lead compounds to address this need. Two Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (AAC) papers screened libraries of approved compounds that may potentially be repurposed as MERS-CoV antivirals. A third AAC paper showed that a previously described severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) helicase inhibitor also has activity against MERS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
