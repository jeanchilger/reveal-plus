We exploit the unique physical properties of EVs as a promising and advantageous nanoplatform for the delivery of therapeutic drugs and genetic materials. Early successes in the discovery of various disease-related characteristics of EVs have driven a new wave of innovation in developing nanoscale drug-delivery systems (DDSs). Nevertheless, there are several issues that need to be considered during the development of these alternative DDSs, such as standardized isolation and preservation methods, efficient drug encapsulation, mechanisms of drug release and so on. In this mini-review, we summarize the current status and progress of EV-based DDSs as an efficient nanoplatform for therapeutics delivery, followed by a discussion on their challenges and future prospects for clinical translation and applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
