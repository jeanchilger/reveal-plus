<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-06-02</DATELINE><TITLE>How I treat respiratory viral infections in the setting of intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation</TITLE><BODY>The widespread use of multiplex molecular diagnostics has led to a significant increase in the detection of respiratory viruses in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Respiratory viruses initially infect the upper respiratory tract and then progress to lower respiratory tract disease in a subset of patients. Lower respiratory tract disease can manifest itself as airflow obstruction or viral pneumonia, which can be fatal. Infection in HCT candidates may require delay of transplantation. The risk of progression differs between viruses and immunosuppressive regimens. Risk factors for progression and severity scores have been described, which may allow targeting treatment to high-risk patients. Ribavirin is the only antiviral treatment option for noninfluenza respiratory viruses; however, high-quality data demonstrating its efficacy and relative advantages of the aerosolized versus oral form are lacking. There are significant unmet needs, including data defining the virologic characteristics and clinical significance of human rhinoviruses, human coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and human bocavirus, as well as the need for new treatment and preventative options.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
