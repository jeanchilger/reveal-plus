<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Quarterly intrinsic disorder digest (January-February-March, 2014)</TITLE><BODY>This is the 5(th) issue of the Digested Disorder series that represents a reader's digest of the scientific literature on intrinsically disordered proteins. We continue to use only 2 criteria for inclusion of a paper to this digest: The publication date (a paper should be published within the covered time frame) and the topic (a paper should be dedicated to any aspect of protein intrinsic disorder). The current digest issue covers papers published during the first quarter of 2014; i.e., during the period of January, February, and March of 2014. Similar to previous issues, the papers are grouped hierarchically by topics they cover, and for each of the included papers a short description is given on its major findings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
