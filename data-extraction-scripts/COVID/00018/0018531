Methods: Before the 2013–2014 influenza season, nasal swabs were obtained from 59 pediatric participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 17 of their healthy siblings immediately before vaccination and 4 times during the week of follow-up. Real-time RT-PCR assays were used to detect influenza RNA. Co-detection of a non-influenza respiratory virus (NIRV) at the time of vaccination was determined by a multiplex RT-PCR assay. Differences in the proportions and rates of influenza detection and their 95% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated. Results: Influenza RNA was detected in 16% fewer participants (95% CrI: −7, 39%) throughout follow-up in the NIRV-positive group compared with the NIRV-negative group (59% vs. 75%). This was also observed in participants with CF alone (66% vs. 74%; RD = 8% 95% CrI: −16, 33%) as well as in healthy participants only (75% vs. 30%; RD = 45%, 95% CrI: −2, 81%). Influenza was detected in NIRV-negative subjects for 0.49 d more compared with NIRV-positive subjects (95% CrI: −0.37, 1.26). Conclusion: The observed proportion of subjects in whom influenza RNA was detected and the duration of detection differed slightly between NIRV- positive and −negative subjects. However, wide credible intervals for the difference preclude definitive conclusions. If true, this observed association may be related to a recent viral respiratory infection, a phenomenon known as viral interference.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
