METHODS: From July to October 2009, 101 cases suspected of suffering from Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) virus were admitted and isolated in Al Nahdha Hospital in Muscat. All the patients on admission were tested for H1N1, by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immediately on admission, all of them were treated with Oseltamivir and antibiotics. RESULTS: Of the 65 confirmed cases of H1N1, 53.84% were males. Age of patients varied from 14 to 60 years, while 53.7% were aged between 31 to 55 years.

Also, 20% of the patients had leucopenia and 10.8% leucocytosis. Deranged LFT was observed in 26 (42.6%) of cases while 14 (21.5%) had hypokalemia. One patient (0.01%) with underlying severe co-morbidity died. Two patients (3.1%) had ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome); both recovered. Radiological infiltration was documented in 84.6% of cases, with lower zone involvement as the common finding. Hospital stay was between 1 to 12 days, 49.2% of patients were discharged within 3 days.
