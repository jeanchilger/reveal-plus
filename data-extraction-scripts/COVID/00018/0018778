<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-10-08</DATELINE><TITLE>A Highly Sensitive Europium Nanoparticle-Based Immunoassay for Detection of Influenza A/B Virus Antigen in Clinical Specimens</TITLE><BODY>We report the development of a novel europium nanoparticle-based immunoassay (ENIA) for rapid detection of influenza A and influenza B viruses. The ENIA demonstrated sensitivities of 90.7% (147/162) for influenza A viruses and 81.80% (9/11) for influenza B viruses compared to those for an in-house reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay in testing of influenza-positive clinical samples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
