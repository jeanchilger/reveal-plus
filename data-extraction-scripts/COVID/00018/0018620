National asthma guidelines do not recommend antibiotics during an exacerbation unless the child has an infection or comorbidities. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) established a benchmark for unjustified antibiotic use at 6.6%.9 A retrospective study at our institution showed that 7.8% of antibiotics were prescribed without justification in children admitted for asthma. The purpose of this study was to reduce unjustified antibiotic use at our institution by 25% in children through an ASP directed toward asthma. METHODS: The study period lasted from November 2015 to March 2016. Children 6 months to 17 years of age, admitted for an asthma exacerbation, were included while those with comorbidities were excluded. A multidisciplinary team from pediatric pharmacotherapy, pulmonology, emergency department (ED), infectious diseases, and quality improvement was formed to focus on process improvement. Interventions were executed in a series of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. In cycle 1, our asthma guidelines on appropriate antibiotic use were disseminated to pediatric house staff and posted in pediatric units. Cycle 2 encompassed presenting the ASP and guidelines to the pediatric ED staff. Cycle 3 consisted of a journal club with the pulmonary division to discuss the role of azithromycin in an asthma exacerbation. RESULTS: In cycle 1, twenty-four patients were reviewed in November 2015. Antibiotics were prescribed in 8/24 (33%) children, with an unjustified rate of 2/24 (8.3%). In cycle 2, twenty-three patients were reviewed in December and January with 8/23 (35%) prescribed antibiotics and an unjustified rate of 2/23 (8.7%). For cycle 3, in February and March 2016, twenty-one children were reviewed. Antibiotics were prescribed in 6/21 (27%) children and all were justified. In total, 68 patients were included in our study and had an unjustified antibiotic prescribing rate of 4/68 (5.9%), a reduction of 25%. CONCLUSION: Our ASP surpassed the benchmark set by AAP guidelines, by reducing the percentage of unjustified antibiotics in children with asthma to 5.9%.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
