Now, we show that these cells also mediate the same process in mice lacking αβ T cells (T-cell receptor β-deficient [TCRβ(−/−)] mice) and demyelination is gamma interferon (IFN-γ) dependent. Most strikingly, our results also show a major role for NKG2D, expressed on γδ T cells, in the demyelinating process with in vivo blockade of NKG2D interactions resulting in a 60% reduction in demyelination. NKG2D may serve as a primary recognition receptor or as a costimulatory molecule. We show that NKG2D(+) γδ T cells in the JHM-infected central nervous system express the adaptor molecule DAP12 and an NKG2D isoform (NKG2D short), both required for NKG2D to serve as a primary receptor. These results are consistent with models in which γδ T cells mediate demyelination using the same effector cytokine, IFN-γ, as CD8 T cells and do so without a requirement for signaling through the TCR.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
