<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-09-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Design and integration of an all-in-one biomicrofluidic chip</TITLE><BODY>We demonstrate a highly integrated microfluidic chip with the function of DNA amplification. The integrated chip combines giant electrorheological-fluid actuated micromixer and micropump with a microheater array, all formed using soft lithography. Internal functional components are based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and silver∕carbon black-PDMS composites. The system has the advantages of small size with a high degree of integration, high polymerase chain reaction efficiency, digital control and simple fabrication at low cost. This integration approach shows promise for a broad range of applications in chemical synthesis and biological sensing∕analysis, as different components can be combined to target desired functionalities, with flexible designs of different microchips easily realizable through soft lithography.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
