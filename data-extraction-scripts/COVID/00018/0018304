<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Interferon-λs: Special Immunomodulatory Agents and Potential Therapeutic Targets</TITLE><BODY>Interferon (IFN)-λs are a new addition to the old IFN family and share many similarities, such as antiviral and antiproliferative characteristics, with type I IFNs. IFN-λs also exhibit unique characteristics in immunomodulation. Accumulating studies have indicated the interactions between IFN-λs and immune cells, which lead to the regulation of the latter. IFN-λs can influence dendritic cells (DCs) and their product, IFN-λs-DCs, can then regulate the function of T cells. On the other hand, IFN-λs can also directly affect T cells through inhibition of the T helper 2 cell (Th2) responses. IFN-λs have varying immunomodulatory functions under different physiological conditions or in different organs and can inhibit tumor growth via regulation of the immune system. Diseases associated with IFN-λs include asthma, allergy, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the biology of IFN-λs and their immunomodulatory function in relevant human diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
