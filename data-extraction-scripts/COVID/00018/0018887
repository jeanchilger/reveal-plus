The library was screened for the production of Fab antibody fragments to a recombinant spike protein of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). One Fab clone, AS3-3, reacted with the spike protein in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The dissociation constant of AS3-3 was 1.98 × 10(−8) M. Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that it reacted with SARS-CoV-infected cells. The library seems to be a potent tool for the production of human antibodies to SARS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
