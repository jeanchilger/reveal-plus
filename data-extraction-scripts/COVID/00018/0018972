<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-10-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Meeting Report VLPNPV: Sessions 1 and 2: Plenary</TITLE><BODY>Following the highly successful inaugural meeting in 2012, the second instalment of Virus-Like Particles and Nano-Particle Vaccines (VLPNPV), proved to be a worthy follow-up in an outstanding conference series. VLPNPV is a forum for academics and industry to address one of the major areas of need in biomedical sciences, the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. The conference was opened by Professor Marianne Manchester of the University of California, San Diego who pointed to the significance of the site chosen for the conference, the Salk Institute. Founded by Jonas Salk, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies is a non-profit, independent research institute with focuses in molecular biology and genetics, neurosciences, and plant biology. This diversity in research themes reflects the wishes of the institute's founder who saw value in using interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the basic principles in life, aimed at generating new therapies and treatments for human disease. Likewise, interdisciplinarity was reflected in the main themes of the meeting, which also highlight some of the potential advantages of virus-like particle (VLP) and nanoparticle vaccines, including novel formulations/adjuvanting effects, structurally accurate/designed antigens, production systems and capacity, and tailoring the immune response. These themes were covered by the 2 plenary sessions that opened the conference and are described in this report.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
