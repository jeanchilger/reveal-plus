<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-11-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Influenza, solar radiation and vitamin D</TITLE><BODY>The annual death numbers of influenza and pneumonia in Norway were studied for the time period 1980–2000. No direct relationships were found with the variations of the annual UVB fluences, probably due to the fact that these variations did not exceed 30%. However, there was a very pronounced seasonal variation of both influenza deaths and pneumonia deaths, the vast majority occurring during the winter. Vitamin D levels were also estimated from several publications. The data support the hypothesis that a high vitamin D level, as that found in the summer, acts in a protective manner with respect to influenza as well as pneumonia. The findings are discussed and compared with data from tropical and subtropical areas.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
