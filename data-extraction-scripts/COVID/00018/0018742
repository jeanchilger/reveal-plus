The objective of this study was to assess the interactions between MBL and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein (SARS-S). MBL was found to selectively bind to retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-S. Unlike several other viral envelopes to which MBL can bind, both recombinant and plasma-derived human MBL directly inhibited SARS-S-mediated viral infection. Moreover, the interaction between MBL and SARS-S blocked viral binding to the C-type lectin, DC-SIGN. Mutagenesis indicated that a single N-linked glycosylation site, N330, was critical for the specific interactions between MBL and SARS-S. Despite the proximity of N330 to the receptor-binding motif of SARS-S, MBL did not affect interactions with the ACE2 receptor or cathepsin L-mediated activation of SARS-S-driven membrane fusion. Thus, binding of MBL to SARS-S may interfere with other early pre- or postreceptor-binding events necessary for efficient viral entry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
