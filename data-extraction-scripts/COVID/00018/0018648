Using a glia-tropic coronavirus infection, which is initiated in the brain but rapidly spreads to and predominantly persists in the spinal cord, this study characterizes longitudinal changes in B cell subsets at both infected anatomical sites. The phase of T cell-dependent, antibody-independent control of infectious virus was associated with a similar recruitment of naive/early-activated IgD(+) IgM(+) B cells into both the brain and spinal cord. This population was progressively replaced by CD138(−) IgD(−) IgM(+) B cells, isotype-switched CD138(−) IgD(−) IgM(−) memory B cells (B(mem)), and CD138(+) antibody-secreting cells (ASC). A more rapid transition to B(mem) and ASC in spinal cord than in brain was associated with higher levels of persisting viral RNA and transcripts encoding factors promoting B cell migration, differentiation, and survival. The results demonstrate that naive/early-activated B cells are recruited early during coronavirus CNS infection but are subsequently replaced by more differentiated B cells. Furthermore, viral persistence, even at low levels, is a driving force for accumulation of isotype-switched B(mem) and ASC. IMPORTANCE Acute and chronic human CNS infections are associated with an accumulation of heterogeneous B cell subsets; however, their influence on viral load and disease is unclear. Using a glia-tropic coronavirus model, we demonstrate that the accumulation of B cells ranging from early-activated to isotype-switched differentiation stages is both temporally and spatially orchestrated. Acutely infected brains and spinal cords indiscriminately recruit a homogeneous population of early-activated B cells, which is progressively replaced by diverse, more differentiated subsets. The latter process is accelerated by elevated proinflammatory responses associated with viral persistence. The results imply that early-recruited B cells do not have antiviral function but may contribute to the inflammatory environment or act as antigen-presenting cells. Moreover, CNS viral persistence is a driving force promoting differentiated B cells with protective potential.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
