Three Fab clones recognized recombinant MSP-1(19) under nonreducing conditions. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that three Fab clones stained the surfaces of late trophozoites/schizonts and merozoites of the FCR3 and 3D7 strains, suggesting the Fabs' reactivities to a conserved epitope. Sequence analysis of the heavy-chain genes revealed that the closest germ line V segments were VH1-8 and VH7-81, with 91% to 98% homology. The closest germ line D segment was D3-10, and the closest germ line J segment was JH4 or JH5, with 90% to 97% homology. In the light-chain genes, the closest germ line V segment was A27 for the Jκ2, Jκ4, and Jκ5 segments. The dissociation constants of these Fab fragments for recombinant MSP-1(19) ranged from 1.09 × 10(−9) to 2.66 × 10(−9) M. The binding of the three Fab fragments to MSP-1(19) was competitively inhibited by the anti-MSP-1(19) mouse monoclonal antibody 12.8, which inhibits erythrocyte invasion by merozoites. However, the human Fab fragment with the highest affinity did not inhibit in vitro growth of P. falciparum. This is the first report of gene analysis and bacterial expression of human monoclonal antibodies to P. falciparum MSP-1(19). The combinatorial immunoglobulin gene library derived from malaria patients provides a potential tool for producing high-affinity human antibodies specific for P. falciparum.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
