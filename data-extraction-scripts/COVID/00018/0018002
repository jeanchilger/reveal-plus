In a previous study, each of three 5′-end-proximal cis-acting stem-loop domains in the BCoV genome, I/II, III, and IV, yielded near-wild-type (wt) MHV phenotypes when used by reverse genetics to replace its counterpart in the MHV genome. Replacement with the BCoV 32-nucleotide (nt) inter-stem-loop fourth domain between stem-loops III and IV, however, required blind cell passaging for virus recovery. Here, we describe suppressor mutations within the transplanted BCoV 32-nt domain that along with appearance of potential base pairings identify an RNA-RNA interaction between this domain and a 32-nt region ∼200 nt downstream within the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1)-coding region. Mfold and phylogenetic covariation patterns among similarly grouped betacoronaviruses support this interaction, as does cotransplantation of the BCoV 5′ UTR and its downstream base-pairing domain. Interestingly, cotransplantation of the BCoV 5′ UTR and BCoV Nsp1 coding region directly yielded an MHV wt-like phenotype, which demonstrates a cognate interaction between these two BCoV regions, which in the MHV genome act in a fully interspecies-compliant manner. Surprisingly, the 30-nt inter-stem-loop domain in the MHV genome can be deleted and viral progeny, although debilitated, are still produced. These results together identify a previously undescribed long-range RNA-RNA interaction between the 5′ UTR and Nsp1 coding region in MHV-like and BCoV-like betacoronaviruses that is cis acting for viral fitness but is not absolutely required for viral replication in cell culture.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
