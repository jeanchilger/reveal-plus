In this study, we found that memory T cells against M protein were persistent in recovered SARS patients by detecting gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production using ELISA and ELISpot assays. Flow cytometric analysis showed that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were involved in cellular responses to SARS-CoV M antigen. Furthermore, memory CD8(+) T cells displayed an effector memory cell phenotype expressing CD45RO(−) CCR7(−) CD62L(−). In contrast, the majority of IFN-γ(+) CD4(+) T cells were central memory cells with the expression of CD45RO(+) CCR7(+) CD62L(−). The epitope screening from 30 synthetic overlapping peptides that cover the entire SARS-CoV M protein identified four human T-cell immunodominant peptides, p21−44, p65−91, p117−140 and p200−220. All four immunodominant peptides could elicit cellular immunity with a predominance of CD8(+) T-cell response. This data may have important implication for developing SARS vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
