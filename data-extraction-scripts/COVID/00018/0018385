<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-08-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Accurate Detection of Avian Respiratory Viruses by Use of Multiplex PCR-Based Luminex Suspension Microarray Assay</TITLE><BODY>A novel oligonucleotide suspension microarray (Luminex microsphere system) was developed for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viruses of major clinical importance. This test was optimized and validated with 70 clinical samples. The developed tool was accurate for high-throughput detection and differentiation of the most important avian respiratory viruses: avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), infection bronchitis virus (IBV), and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) in single- and mixed-virus infections. A multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), followed by a monoplex or a multiplex Luminex assays, were realized using a Luminex 200 analyzer instrument. The sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the multiplex DNA suspension microarray system were evaluated. The results showed no significant differences in the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value in monoplex and multiplex Luminex assays. The sensitivity and specificity proved to be completely concordant with monoplex real-time RT-PCR. We demonstrated that the multiplex DNA suspension microarray system is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of the main respiratory viruses of poultry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
