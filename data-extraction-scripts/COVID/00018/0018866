Rational use of corticosteroid, non-invasive ventilation and the integration of traditional Chinese medicine and modern medicine may partly have contributed to the lowest fatality figure. There was a close linkage between civet cats and humans in terms of transmission of SARS. Strict control of the wild-animal market may be significant in preventing a new outbreak of SARS this year.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
