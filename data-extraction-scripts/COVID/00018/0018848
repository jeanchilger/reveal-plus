However, the experiments undertaken have not addressed the need for tissue-type matching in order to achieve graft-mediated remyelination since they were performed in conditions in which the chance for graft rejection was minimized. This article focuses on the factors determining survival of allogeneic oligodendrocyte lineage cells and their contribution to the remyelination of demyelinating CNS lesions. The immune status of the CNS as well as the suitability of different models of demyelination for graft rejection studies are discussed, and ways of enhancing allogeneic oligodendrocyte-mediated remyelination are presented. Finally, the effects of glial graft rejection on host remyelination are described, highlighting the potential benefits of the acute CNS inflammatory response for myelin repair.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
