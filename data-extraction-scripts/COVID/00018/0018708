<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-10-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Optimizing Post-Intensive Care Unit Rehabilitation</TITLE><BODY>Survivors of intensive care unit (ICU) admission face unique challenges after hospital discharge. In addition to an increased overall mortality and rates of hospital readmission, patients often experience difficulties in physical functioning, cognition, and mental health, which are collectively termed post-intensive care syndrome. To this date, there are no established strategies to address these deleterious outcomes. A number of studies have examined various unique methods to prevent and treat PICS symptoms, including early physical and occupational therapy, providing post-discharge education, or facilitating routine follow up in post-ICU clinics. These trials have yet to demonstrate any substantial or meaningful effect in post-ICU patients and collectively reinforce the need for further research to identify effective intervention for patients who survive critical illness.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
