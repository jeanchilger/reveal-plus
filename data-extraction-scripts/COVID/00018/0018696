Some endogenous retroviruses are involved in development, while others cause disease. The Genome Parsing Suite (GPS) is a software tool to track and trace all Retroid agents in any sequenced genome (M. A. McClure et al., Genomics 85:512-523, 2005). Using the GPS, the retroviral content was assessed in four model teleost fish. Eleven new species of fish retroviruses are identified and characterized. The reverse transcriptase protein sequences were used to reconstruct a fish retrovirus phylogeny, thereby, significantly expanding the epsilonretrovirus family. Most of these novel retroviruses encode additional genes, some of which are homologous to cellular genes that would confer viral advantage. Although the fish divergence is much more ancient, retroviruses began infecting fish genomes approximately 4 million years ago.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
