In the current study, two positive monoclonal cell lines (5D7 and 3H4) specific for PEDV were established, and the immunoreactivity of the monoclonal antibodies was confirmed by immunofluorescence and dot-immunobinding assays. A method, termed antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA), which used the monoclonal antibody 5D7 as the detecting antibody and rabbit antiserum of PEDV protein S as the capture antibody, was developed. Compared with the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method of detecting PEDV in fecal samples, AC-ELISA showed similar sensitivity and specificity. These results suggested that AC-ELISA would be useful for the diagnosis and epidemiological studies of PEDV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
