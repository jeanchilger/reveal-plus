Coronary vasospasm is a known complication of infusional and bolus 5-FU administration. In patients who experience coronary vasospasm, 5-FU is often discontinued. Several cases of successful re-challenge with bolus 5-FU, utilizing calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and nitrates to prophylaxis against coronary vasospasm recurrence, have been reported in the literature. However, since there is increased variability of time to symptom onset with infusional 5-FU, re-challenge with infusional 5-FU has not been widely studied. Given potential differences in the toxicity profile and exposure time, infusional may be more appropriate than bolus for some patients. Here we report successful re-challenge with infusional 5-FU, following coronary vasospasm during the first cycle of 5-FU plus leucovorin plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy, in a patient with metastatic colon cancer and coronary artery disease (CAD). The 5-FU re-challenge plan included dose reduction, CCB and nitrate prophylaxis, and telemetry monitoring.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
