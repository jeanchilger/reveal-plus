In order to provide more information on the viral evolution of IBVs, a new virulent strain named GX-NN09032, isolated from Guangxi, China, in 2009, was sequenced, and phylogenetic and recombination analyses were conducted. Furthermore, potential recombination events associated with GX-NN09032 were found in four IBV strains, including GX-YL5, DY07, CK/CH/SD09/005, TC07-2. The present study suggested that GX-NN09032 might contribute to the emergence of modern IBV variants through recombination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
