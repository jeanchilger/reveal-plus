Infection control practices are geared towards reduction of occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate knowledge and attitudes of infection prevention and control among Health Science students at University of Namibia. METHODS: To assess students' knowledge and attitudes regarding infection prevention and control and their sources of information, a self-administered questionnaire was used to look at standard precautions especially hands hygiene. RESULTS: One hundred sixty two students participated in this study of which 31 were medical, 17 were radiography and 114 were nursing students. Medical students had better overall scores (73%) compared to nursing students (66%) and radiology students (61%). There was no significant difference in scores between sexes or location of the high school being either in rural or urban setting. CONCLUSION: Serious efforts are needed to improve or review curriculum so that health sciences students' knowledge on infection prevention and control is imparted early before they are introduced to the wards.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
