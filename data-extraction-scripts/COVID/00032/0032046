Virus bound to isolated membranes from susceptible mice, but not to membranes from resistant mice. F1 progeny of SJL/J X BALB/c mice had an intermediate level of virus-binding activity on their enterocyte and hepatocyte membranes. This correlated well with previous studies showing that susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is controlled by a single autosomal dominant gene (M. S. Smith, R. E. Click, and P. G. W. Plagemann, J. Immunol. 133:428-432). Because virus binding was not prevented by treating membranes with sodium dodecyl sulfate, the virus-binding molecule could be identified by a virus overlay protein blot assay. Virus bound to a single broad band of Mr 100,000 to 110,000 in membranes from hepatocytes or enterocytes of susceptible BALB/c and semisusceptible C3H mice, but no virus-binding band was detected in comparable preparations of resistant SJL/J mouse membranes. Therefore, SJL/J mice may be resistant to mouse hepatitis virus A59 infection because they lack a specific virus receptor which is present on the plasma membranes of target cells from genetically susceptible BALB/c and semisusceptible C3H mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
