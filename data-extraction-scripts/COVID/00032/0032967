The stools were examined by routine bacterial culture, and by electron microscopy for virus particles. The stools of a comparable control group of infants who had no gastrointestinal symptoms were also similarly examined. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., and rotaviruses, as well as other viruses, particularly adenoviruses and coronaviruses, were isolated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
