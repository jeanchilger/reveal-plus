<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1987-02-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Seroepidemiological studies on the occurrence of common respiratory infections in paediatric student nurses and medical technology students.</TITLE><BODY>The occupational risk of acquiring minor respiratory infections for paediatric student nurses was estimated by performing serological examinations with influenza A, B, C, parainfluenza, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae at 6-month intervals over a period of 4 years in paediatric student nurses at two schools of nursing and students at one school of medical technology. Titre increases against all tested agents occurred 1.86 times more often in the student nurses than in the medical technology students, the most frequent agents in both groups being influenza A and B. No difference in the relative distribution of the agents could be verified in the two occupational groups. Data on the protective value of pre-infectious antibody levels for influenza A, B, and coronavirus OC43 and on the importance of the spread of single agents among classmates are presented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
