To investigate the targeting of this type of enzyme to plant Golgi compartments, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase, a glycosyltransferase of the mammalian trans-Golgi cisternae and the trans-Golgi network. Biochemical analysis as well as immunolight and immunoelectron microscopy of these plants indicate that the protein is targeted specifically to the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, the protein is predominantly localized to the cisternae and membranes of the trans side of the organelle. When supplied with the appropriate substrates, the enzyme has significant alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase activity. These results indicate a conservation of glycosyltransferase targeting mechanisms between plant and mammalian cells and also demonstrate that glycosyltransferases can be subcompartmentalized to specific cisternae of the plant Golgi apparatus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
