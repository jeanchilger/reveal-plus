Because the E2 glycoprotein is responsible for many of the biological functions of coronaviruses, experiments were done to determine whether there were any E2 functional differences between these two antigenic groups. The avirulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) isolate FIPV-UCD-2, which has one antigenic type of E2, was less rapidly internalized and could not spread from cell to cell in the presence of neutralizing antibody. Two virulent isolates, FIPV-DF2 and FIPV-79-1146, as well as the non-FIP-causing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) isolate FECV-79-1683, all of which have the second antigenic type of E2, were very rapidly internalized and were able to spread from cell to cell despite the presence of neutralizing antibody. The avirulent FIPV-UCD-2 and FECV-79-1683 isolates were more labile at 37 degrees C at pHs of 6.5 and above than were the virulent FIPV-DF2 and FIPV-79-1146 isolates.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
