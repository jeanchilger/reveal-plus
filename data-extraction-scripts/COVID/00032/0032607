We have analysed the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) infection. Surprisingly, we detected only a very clear virus-specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted cytotoxicity in mice infected with MHV-A59. We found no evidence of activation of the classical CD8+ MHC class I-restricted CTL. The virus-specific CD4+ CTL derived from two different mouse strains having different MHC haplotypes recognized the same immunodominant epitope. This epitope, comprising the amino acid residues 329-343 of the viral S-glycoprotein, was recognized both at the polyclonal level and by virus-specific CTL clones. Transfer studies using a MHV-A59-specific CD4+ CTL clone showed significant protection against a lethal challenge with MHV-A59, implicating that these CD4+ CTL play a pivotal role in the protection against MHV-A59 infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
