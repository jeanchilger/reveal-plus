<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1990-11-12</DATELINE><TITLE>A comparison of three oral electrolyte solutions in the treatment of diarrheic calves</TITLE><BODY>Thirty-six diarrheic calves infected with rota- and coronaviruses were randomly allocated to one of three oral electrolyte treatments: Ion-Aid (Syntex Agribusiness), Life-Guard (Norden Inc), or Revibe (Langford Inc). The calves were also allowed voluntary access to milk which was offered at the rate of 5% of body weight per feeding in two feedings daily. There were significant differences in recovery rate among calves treated with the different electrolytes. Only 33% of Ion-Aid-treated calves recovered; Revibe- and Life-Guard-treated calves had high recovery rates of 92% and 83%, respectively. The much higher recovery rates with Life-Guard and Revibe were attributed to the presence of an alkalizing agent in these preparations. Life-Guard uses bicarbonate to counteract acidosis and there was some evidence that this may have interfered with milk digestion. Revibe uses acetate; this was effectively metabolized within the calves' tissues and produced alkalization without interference with milk digestion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
