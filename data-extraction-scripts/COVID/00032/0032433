<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1999-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Evaluation of the ImmunoCardSTAT! Rotavirus Assay for Detection of Group A Rotavirus in Fecal Specimens</TITLE><BODY>Rapid detection of group A rotavirus was performed by using ImmunoCardStat! Rotavirus (ICS-RV) (which uses immunogold-based, horizontal-flow membrane technology), two commercial enzyme immunoassays (Premier Rotaclone and TestPack Rotavirus), and electron microscopy. A total of 249 stool specimens collected from children with gastroenteritis between February and April 1997 were tested. After resolution of 19 of the 22 discordant results by reverse transcription-PCR for group A rotavirus, ICS-RV detected 125 positives while Rotaclone and TestPack detected 127 and 129 positives, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 94.0, 100, 100, and 93.4% for ICS-RV; 95.5, 100, 100, and 95.0% for Rotaclone; and 97.0, 96.5, 97.0, and 96.5% for TestPack. ICS-RV was sensitive and specific and was relatively simple to perform and interpret.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
