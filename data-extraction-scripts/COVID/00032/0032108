The disease usually involves trachea, nose, and outer ears. To investigate whether the tissue distribution of RP may be explained by a specific immune response, we immunized rats with cartilage matrix protein (matrilin-1), a protein predominantly expressed in tracheal cartilage. After 2–3 weeks, some rats developed a severe inspiratory stridor. They had swollen noses and/or epistaxis, but showed neither joint nor outer ear affection. The inflammatory lesions involved chronic active erosions of cartilage. Female rats were more susceptible than males. The disease susceptibility was controlled by both MHC genes (f, l, d, and a haplotypes are high responders, and u, n, and c are resistant) and non-MHC genes (the LEW strain is susceptible; the DA strain is resistant). However, all strains mounted a pronounced IgG response to cartilage matrix protein. The initiation and effector phase of the laryngotracheal involvement causing the clinical symptoms were shown to depend on αβ T cells. Taken together, these results represent a novel model for RP: matrilin-1–induced RP. Our findings also suggest that different cartilage proteins are involved in pathogenic models of RP and RA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
