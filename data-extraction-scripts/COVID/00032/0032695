<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-08-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Preparing the Biochemistry Laboratory for the Next Outbreak: Lessons from SARS in Singapore</TITLE><BODY>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging disease characterised by fever and atypical pneumonia and caused by a novel coronavirus. Singapore was affected by the global pandemic in early 2003, with 238 cases and 33 deaths. Samples sent to the biochemistry laboratory made up the majority (69%) of all SARS samples, yet remained a minority (29%) of total biochemistry workload. This paper describes the problems encountered and solutions adopted by the biochemistry laboratory at the designated SARS hospital in coping with this epidemic. It provides practical advice for laboratories planning for the handling of samples from future outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
