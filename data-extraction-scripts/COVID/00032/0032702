The following diagnostic tools were used: 1) direct smears of intestinal content, 2) Escherichia coli counts, 3) aerobic bacterial cultures of the small intestine and other organs (The O serogroup and the enterotoxigenicity of the E. coli isolated was determined), 4) detection of the two Nebraska NCD viruses (reo-like and corona-like) by the fluorescent antibody technique and 5) histological examination on different segments of the digestive tract. The following etiological diagnoses were suggested after post mortem examination of 55 cases of NDC (34 were submitted alive): reo-like virus only (1), reo-like virus + E. coli (4), reo-like virus + cryptosporidium (2), reo- + corona-like viruses (5), reo- + corona-like viruses + cryptosporidium (3), reo- + corona-like viruses + infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (1), coronavirus-like agent only (2), coronavirus-like agent + mycotic abomasitis (1), coronavirus-like agent + crytosporidium (1), E. coli only (6), cryptosporidium only (5), mycotic abomasitis (3), mycotic rumenitis + reticulitis (1) and undetermined (20). Most of the calves in the last group were submitted dead.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
