Hydrocephalus was induced in 116 of 120 rats and in 23 of 28 hamsters. The severity of hydrocephalus was greater in the rats than in the hamsters. Hydrocephalus induction occurred only subsequent to inoculation of viable M. pulmonis. At 2 weeks of age, rats became refractory to induction of hydrocephalus. Light microscopy indicated that the hydrocephalus was communicating without an inflammatory response in the ventricles and meninges. Preliminary electron microscopy revealed that amorphous material covered portions of the ependymal surface and that cilia were sometimes matted together. It was suggested that the hydrocephalus was due to ciliary dysfunction or to an imbalance of cerebrospinal fluid secretion and absorption. This M. pulmonis-induced hydrocephalus may be a useful model for elucidating the pathogenesis of certain types of congenital hydrocephalus in humans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
