<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1980-05-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Genome of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus.</TITLE><BODY>The Purdue strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a porcine coronavirus, was grown to titers of greater than 10(8) PFU/ml in a swine testicle cell line, and the RNA was isotopically labeled with [3H]uridine. The RNA was extracted from purified virus and was found to have the following properties. (i) It consisted primarily of a homogeneous large-molecular-weight species which electrophoretically migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 6.8 X 10(6) under denaturing conditions. (ii) It migrated electrophoretically at the same rate on nondenaturing gels before and after heat denaturation, suggesting that it does not consist of subunits. (iii) It was susceptible to pancreatic RNase A digestion in high (0.3 M) NaCl. (iv) It was polyadenylated to the extent that greater than 60% of the native RNA bound to oligodeoxythymidilic acid-cellulose under conditions of high (0.5 M) NaCl. RNA extracted from virions was infectious. This coronavirus can therefore be characterized as a positive-strand RNA virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
