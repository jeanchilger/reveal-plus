In a previous report, we showed that mutations in the RNA encoding an immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitope within the surface glycoprotein (epitope S-510-518) were present in all persistently infected animals and that these mutations abrogated recognition by virus-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in direct ex vivo cytotoxicity assays. To obtain further evidence that these mutations were necessary for the development of clinical disease, the temporal course of their appearance was determined. Mutations in the epitope were identified by 10 to 12 days after inoculation, and in some mice, virus containing mutated epitope was the dominant species detected by 15 days. In addition, most mice that remain asymptomatic at 80 days after inoculation, a time after which clinical disease almost never develops, were infected with only wild-type virus. Finally, analysis of virus isolated from mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) revealed the presence only of wild-type epitope S-510-518. These results, by showing that mutations are not selected in SCID mice and occur at early times after inoculation in C57BL/6 mice, support the view that they result from immune pressure and contribute to virus persistence and demyelination in mice infected persistently with MHV-JHM.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
