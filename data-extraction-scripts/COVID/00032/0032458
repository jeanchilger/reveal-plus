Histopathology of biopsies of the lesions detected nodular pyogranulomatous dermatitis with vasculitis and necrosis, leading to a suspicion of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Postmortem examination revealed gross lesions consistent with FIP. Histopathologic lesions and positive immunohistochemical staining for feline coronavirus in multiple tissues, including the skin, confirmed the diagnosis of FIP. The current case was similar to previous cases, except for the initial presentation with cutaneous lesions and no other clinical signs, which had not been reported previously.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
