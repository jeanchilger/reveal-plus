<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1970-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Presence of Particles other than the Australia-SH Antigen in a Case of Chronic Active Hepatitis with Cirrhosis</TITLE><BODY>Examination of serum specimens from a patient with chronic active hepatitis proved negative to the Australia-SH antigen by immunodiffusion and by complement fixation. Because the sera were anticomplementary they were examined with the electron microscope, and virus-like structures similar to members of the coronavirus group were identified. The possible significance of this finding in human serum and its relation to mouse hepatitis virus are discussed. A sample of the serum pool containing the MS-1 agent was found negative when examined by immunodiffusion, complement fixation, and electron microscopy. The possible lack of immunological identity between infectious and serum hepatitis is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
