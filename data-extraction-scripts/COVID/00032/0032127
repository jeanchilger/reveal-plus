Clones expressing E1 antigenic determinants were selected with a polyclonal anti-E1 antibody and used for immunization of rabbits and for affinity purification of existing polyclonal antisera. Immunofluorescence testing and immunoperoxidase labeling of coronavirus-infected cells showed that these reagents were monospecific for E1. In addition, by using hybrid proteins containing different lengths of the E1 carboxy terminus to affinity-purify a polyclonal antiserum against E1, we have been able to define two epitopes within the last 15 amino acid residues of the protein. These epitope-specific antibodies bind to E1 in Golgi and perinuclear membranes as well as to budding viruses; they do not, however, label the plasma membrane or the membranes of post-Golgi vesicles transporting virions to the cell surface.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
