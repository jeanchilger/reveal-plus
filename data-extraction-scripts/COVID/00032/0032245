Monoclonal antibody specific for N protein coimmunoprecipitated MHV genomic RNA as well as all six MHV subgenomic mRNAs found in MHV-infected cells. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies to the MHV E2 or E1 envelope glycoproteins, an anti-I-A monoclonal antibody, and serum samples from lupus patients did not immunoprecipitate the MHV mRNAs. Moreover, the anti-N monoclonal antibody did not coimmunoprecipitate vesicular stomatitis virus RNA or host cell RNA under conditions which immunoprecipitated all MHV RNAs. These data suggest a specific interaction between the N protein and the virus-specific mRNAs. Both the membrane-bound and cytosolic small MHV leader-specific RNAs of greater than 65 nucleotides long were immunoprecipitated only by anti-N monoclonal antibody. These data suggest that an N binding site is present within the leader RNA sequences at a site at least 65 nucleotides from the 5' end of genomic RNA and all six subgenomic mRNAs. The larger leader-containing RNAs originating from mRNA 1 and mRNA 6, as well as the MHV negative-stranded RNA, were also immunoprecipitated by the anti-N monoclonal antibody. These data indicate that the MHV N protein is associated with MHV-specific RNAs and RNA intermediates and may play an important functional role during MHV transcription and replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
