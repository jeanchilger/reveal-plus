We now present data on the structural proteins of EAV and the assignment of their respective genes. Virions are composed of a 14-kDa nucleocapsid protein (N) and three membrane proteins designated M, GS, and GL. M is an unglycosylated protein of 16 kDa, and GS and GL are N-glycosylated proteins of 25 and 30 to 42 kDa, respectively. The broad size distribution of GL results from heterogeneous N-acetyllactosamine addition since it is susceptible to digestion by endo-beta-galactosidase. Using monospecific antisera as well as an antivirion serum, and by expression of individual ORFs, the genes for the structural proteins were identified: ORF 7 codes for N, ORF 6 for M, ORF 5 for GL, and ORF 2 for GS. With the exception of GS, the proteins are about equally abundant in EAV virions, being present at a molar ratio of 3 (N):2 (M):3 (GL). The GS protein, which is expressed at a level similar to that of M in infected cells, is strikingly underrepresented in virus particles (1 to 2%). Our data justify a distinct taxonomic position for EAV, together with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus and simian hemorrhagic fever virus; although coronavirus- and toroviruslike in features of transcription and translation, the virion architecture of EAV is fundamentally different.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
