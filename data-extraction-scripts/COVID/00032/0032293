<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1979-01-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Bovine coronavirus genome.</TITLE><BODY>The tissue culture-adapted strain (Mebus) of the bovine coronavirus was grown to titers of greater than 10(7) 50% tissue culture infective doses per ml in secondary bovine embryo kidney cells, and the RNA was isotopically labeled with [3H]uridine. The RNA was extracted from purified virus and was found to have the following properties. (i) It consisted primarily of a homogeneous large-molecular-weight species which comigrated electrophoretically with vesicular stomatitis viral RNA and therefore had an apparent molecular weight of 3.8 X 10(6). (ii) It remained as a 3.8 x 10(6)-molecular-weight molecule after heat denaturation when rapidly harvested virus was examined. (iii) It was 80% susceptible to pancreatic RNase A digestion in high (0.3 M) NaCl, and the 20% resistant fraction was 4S to 7S in size. (iv) It was polyadenylated to the extent that 40 and 60% of the native RNA bound to polyuridylic acid-Sepharose and oligodeoxythymidylic acid-cellulose, respectively, under conditions of high (0.5 M) NaCl.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
