Sixty-two animals were inoculated intranasally on day 0 and 21 days later with approximately 10(2) median tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the tenth passage of PRC replicated in L-2 cells. Animals were selected at random postvaccination to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRC by histopathology, immunohistochemistry and serology. At three and six months postvaccination (PV), vaccinated and seronegative control rats were inoculated intranasally with approximately 10(3) TCID50 doses of virulent SDA virus. Challenged rats were then killed at 6, 10 and 14 days postchallenge and necropsied. Evaluations were based on lesion indices in lacrimal and salivary glands and respiratory tract, the presence of viral antigen by immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. Lesions were observed in rats killed PV, but in general, they were significantly reduced compared with those present in seronegative animals post-exposure to virulent SDA virus (p < or = 0.05). However, they were still considered to be an unacceptable level for a routine vaccination procedure. Potvaccination antibody titers to rat coronavirus were evident in all animals tested at three or six months prior to challenge with SDA virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
