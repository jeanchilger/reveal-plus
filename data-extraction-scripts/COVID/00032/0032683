Double immunofluorescence with antibodies to virus and cell markers showed infection of fetal astrocytes and of adult microglia and astrocytes by strain OC43. RNA amplification revealed infection of fetal astrocytes, adult microglia, and a mixed culture of adult oligodendrocytes and astrocytes by strain 229E. Infectious virus was released only from fetal astrocytes, with higher titers for OC43. Human coronaviruses have the capacity to infect some cells of the central nervous system, although infection of adult cells appears abortive.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
