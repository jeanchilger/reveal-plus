Some of these isolates vary markedly in their ability to cause disease. Specific-pathogen-free cats were inoculated with the avirulent FIPV-UCD-2 isolate or the extremely virulent FIPV-79-1146 isolate or both. After 1 month, cats which had received FIPV-79-1146 were either dead or showed clinical signs of FIP. All cats which received only FIPV-UCD-2 remained healthy up to 6 months after inoculation. Antibody-mediated immune enhancement of disease was not observed in cats which received FIPV-UCD-2 before inoculation with FIPV-79-1146. Monoclonal antibodies which recognized type-specific epitopes on each of the structural polypeptides of these two viruses were used in competitive-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to analyze the humoral immune responses of the cats. All cats produced antibodies to epitopes found on the homologous virus. In addition, cats inoculated with FIPV-79-1146 also produced antibodies which inhibited the binding of the anti-FIPV-UCD-2 E1 monoclonal antibody. One cat inoculated twice with FIPV-UCD-2 produced antibodies which inhibited the binding of the anti-FIPV-79-1146 N- and E1-specific monoclonal antibodies. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays may prove useful in distinguishing cats which are infected with virulent FIPV isolates from cats infected with avirulent feline coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
