The inducers used were Newcastle disease virus (NDV), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly IC), poly IC complexed with diethylaminoethyl dextran (poly IC-DEAEdx) and poly IC complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose. The highest yields of POIFN-alpha were obtained from porcine peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) cultures induced with NDV. The concentrations of both cells and virus were critical for high yields of IFN, which were also enhanced by priming. Poly IC was found to be a relatively poor IFN inducer in PBL, in which low yields were obtained only after priming or in response to poly IC-DEAEdx. POIFN-beta was prepared by induction of the PK-15 cell line with poly IC or poly IC-DEAEdx. The highest yields were obtained from cultures induced 24 h after seeding, although when poly IC-DEAEdx or superinduction was used, the age of the cells was less critical. Priming had little effect on the yields of POIFN-beta. PK-15 cells induced with NDV gave relatively low yields of IFN. Both POIFN-alpha and POIFN-beta were classified as type I IFN on the basis of their resistance or susceptibility to pH 2.0, ultracentrifugation, 56 degrees C and trypsin treatment. Disulphide bonds essential for antiviral activity were demonstrated in both types of IFN by reduction with 2-beta-mercaptoethanol, and anionic exchange chromatography after treatment with dithiothreitol indicated a second disulphide bond in POIFN-alpha which was not essential for antiviral activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
