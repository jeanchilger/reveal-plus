The complete sequence of ORF1b (6873 nucleotides) was determined. Like the coronaviruses, BEV was shown to express its ORF1b by ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the genomic RNA. The predicted tertiary RNA structure (a pseudoknot) in the toro- and coronaviral frameshift-directing region is similar. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the predicted BEV ORF1b translation product revealed homology with the ORF1b product of coronaviruses. Four conserved domains were identified: the putative polymerase domain, an area containing conserved cysteine and histidine residues, a putative helicase motif, and a domain which seems to be unique for toro- and coronaviruses. The data on the 3' part of the polymerase gene of BEV supplement previously observed similarities between toro- and coronaviruses at the level of genome organization and expression. The two virus families are more closely related to each other than to other families of positive-stranded RNA viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
