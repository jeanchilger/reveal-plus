<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012</DATELINE><TITLE>Can Kawasaki Disease Be Managed?</TITLE><BODY>Kawasaki Disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired cardiovascular disease among children, but management of KD has received relatively little attention. In the US alone, about 5500 cases were estimated in 2009. KD is most common among Asian and Pacific Islander children but can affect all ethnicities and races. Timely and accurate diagnosis remains critical, but difficult: the etiology of KD is unknown, and no accurate diagnostic laboratory test has been developed. Continuing medical education can help physicians, clinicians, and nurse practitioners accurately diagnose and treat KD. A registry specific to KD or a surveillance system may be necessary to increase awareness among health care professionals and to decrease complications related to misdiagnosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
