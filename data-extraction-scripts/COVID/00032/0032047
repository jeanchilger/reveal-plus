J. M. Spaan, P. J. M. Rottier, M. C. Horzinek, and B. A. M. van der Zeijst, Virology 108:424-434, 1981). The individual RNAs, prepared by agarose gel electrophoresis of the polyadenylated RNA fraction from infected cells, were obtained pure, except for the preparations of RNAs 4, 5, and 6, which contained some contamination of RNA 7. The RNAs were microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, and after incubation of these cells in the presence of [35S]methionine, the proteins synthesized were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Whereas no translation products of RNAs 1, 2, 4, and 5 were detected, the synthesis of virus-specific polypeptides coded by RNAs 3, 6, and 7 was observed. RNA 7 (0.6 X 10(6) daltons) directed the synthesis of a 54,000-molecular-weight polypeptide which comigrated with viral nucleocapsid protein and which was immunoprecipitated by antiserum from mice that had been infected with the virus. RNA 6 (0.9 X 10(6) daltons) directed the synthesis of three polypeptides with molecular weights of 24,000, 25,500, and 26,500, which migrated with the same electrophoretic mobilities as three low-molecular-weight virion polypeptides. After injection of RNA 3 (3.0 X 10(6) daltons), a polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 150,000 was immunoprecipitated. This polypeptide had no counterpart in the virion, but comigrated with a virus-specific glycoprotein present in infected cells which is immunoprecipitated by a rabbit antiserum against the mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 structural proteins. This antiserum could also immunoprecipitate the translation products of RNAs 3, 6, and 7. These results indicate that RNAs 3, 6, and 7 encode viral structural proteins. The significance of the data with respect to the strategy of coronavirus replication is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
