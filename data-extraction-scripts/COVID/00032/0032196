They are thought to represent constituents of the peplomer (E2; molecular weights of 280,000 and 240,000), the envelope (E1; molecular weights of 28,000, 31,500, and 33,000), and the nucleocapsid (N; molecular weight of 48,000). In infected cells, proteins with molecular weights of 195,000 (E2), 48,000 (N), and 28,000 (E1) were detected. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N glycosylation, prevented the appearance of polypeptides with molecular weights of 195,000 and 28,000 in infected cells; instead, proteins with molecular weights of 160,000 and 25,000 were observed. One minor and five major mRNA species were detected in porcine cells after infection. Their size was determined to be 23.6 kilobases (kb) (RNA1), 8.4 kb (RNA3), 3.8 kb (RNA4), 3.0 kb (RNA5), 2.6 kb (RNA6), and 1.9 kb (RNA7). The RNAs were translated in vitro. RNA7 was shown to code for the N protein. Although complete separation of RNA6 could not be achieved, it was shown to encode an unglycosylated (molecular weight of 25,000) precursor of E1 (molecular weight of 28,000). RNA4 was translated into a nonstructural protein with a molecular weight of 24,000. Translation of RNA3 resulted in proteins with molecular weights of 250,000 and 130,000 and smaller molecules which could be precipitated with a monoclonal antibody directed against E2.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
