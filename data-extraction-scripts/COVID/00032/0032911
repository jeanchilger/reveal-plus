Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments using polyclonal antisera showed that the four major structural proteins of TCV cross-reacted with the four homologous proteins of bovine enteric coronavirus (BCV), the N and M proteins of mouse hepatitis virus serotype 3, and the N protein of IBV. Close antigenic relationships between TCV and BCV were also established by seroneutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition. Of 49 monoclonal antibodies produced against either TCV or BCV, 11 differentiated the two viruses. Five of these monoclonal antibodies had neutralizing activities and were directed to either the peplomeric S (gp200-gp100) or hemagglutinin HE (gp140-gp65) glycoproteins. BCV cDNA probes tested on purified viral preparations and coronavirus-positive (by electron microscopy) fecal samples from diarrheic turkey poults confirmed the relatedness of TCV and BCV. The two viruses produced distinct cytopathic changes in HRT-18 cells in the presence of trypsin, whereas only TCV isolates were able to reproduce the clinical symptoms in turkey poults. Their matrix (M) proteins undergo different glycosylation processes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
