<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1982-10-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Activity of 2-(3,4-dichlorophenoxy)-5-nitrobenzonitrile (MDL-860) against picornaviruses in vitro.</TITLE><BODY>The newly synthesized compound 2-(3,4-dichlorophenoxy)-5-nitrobenzonitrile (MDL-860) has been found to inhibit picornavirus replication. In multiple growth cycle experiments, 1 microgram of MDL-860 per ml caused a reduction in virus yield of at least 1.0 log10 50% tissue culture infectious doses per 0.2 ml for 8 of 10 enteroviruses and 72 of 90 rhinovirus serotypes. This antiviral activity was dependent on both compound concentration and virus inoculum size. At concentrations that had no toxic effects on cell cultures, MDL-860 did not inhibit cytopathic effect or hemadsorption activity due to coronavirus 229-E, vesicular stomatitis virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, adenovirus, influenza virus A, or parainfluenza virus 1. Compound concentrations up to 25 micrograms/ml did not cause cytopathic effect in short-term cultures of rhesus monkey, WI-38, or HeLa cells; 10 micrograms/ml did not inhibit the replication of HeLa cells. The mechanism of action of MDL-860 has not been defined, although it was not directly virucidal and appeared to inhibit picornaviruses specifically at an early step in the virus-host cell interaction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
