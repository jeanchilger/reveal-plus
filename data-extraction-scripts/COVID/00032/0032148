Previous studies have identified two important RNA signals for frameshifting, the slippery sequence and a downstream stem–loop structure. However, there have been somewhat conflicting reports concerning the individual contributions of these sequences. In this study we have performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of the cis-acting RNA sequences involved in HIV-1 gag–pol and HTLV-2 gag–pro frameshifting. Using an in vitro translation system we determined frameshifting efficiencies for shuffled HIV-1/HTLV-2 RNA elements in a background of HIV-1 or HTLV-2 sequences. We show that the ability of the slippery sequence and stem–loop to promote ribosomal frameshifting is influenced by the flanking upstream sequence and the nucleotides in the spacer element. A wide range of frameshift efficiency rates was observed for both viruses when shuffling single sequence elements. The results for HIV-1/HTLV-2 chimeric constructs represent strong evidence supporting the notion that the viral wild-type sequences are not designed for maximal frameshifting activity but are optimized to a level suited to efficient viral replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
