We have tested the capacity of HCMV to in vitro infect human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors and found that certain PBMC are permissive to HCMV infection. In vitro-infected viable cells were double stained for surface expression of different HMCV proteins and for cell-type-specific antigens to allow the identification of sensitive cells. All analysis were performed on viable cells, using HCMV-specific monoclonal antibodies and automated flow cytofluorimetry. PBMC were infected either with the laboratory-adapted HCMV strain AD169 or with a virus isolate obtained from a viremic patient. Up to 25% of all PBMC could express the major immediate-early antigen as well as the pp65 antigen, known at the lower matrix protein. Infected cells were mainly CD14+ monocytes, but also a small population of large CD8+ cells were susceptible to HCMV infection. CD19+ B lymphocytes were resistant to HCMV infection. Different populations of infected cells were enriched by using Dynabeads coated with cell-type-specific antibodies, and the presence of infectious virus was demonstrated by incubating the selected and sonicated cell material on human fibroblasts. Only material from infected monocytes and from CD3+ CD8+ cells gave rise to HCMV-specific plaques. The presence of HCMV mRNA as a sign of active viral transcription of the major immediate-early and late pp150 genes in infected cells was demonstrated by using nested reversed polymerase chain reaction. A common denominator was found for all cells that could be infected with HCMV. The CD13 antigen, a 130- to 150-kDa integral membrane protein identical to the enzyme aminopeptidase N, was expressed on all HCMV-permissive cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
