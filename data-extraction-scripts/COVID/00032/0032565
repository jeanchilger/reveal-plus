In plaque neutralization assays, antisera prepared against multiple sclerosis isolates SK and SD demonstrated significant cross-reactivity to each other and to murine coronavirus A59, weak cross-reactivity to murine coronavirus JHM, but no cross-reactivity to the human coronavirus 229E. Antiserum to SK or SD failed to inhibit hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes by the human coronavirus OC43. However, OC43 antiserum neutralized both SD and SK. Specific coronavirus polypeptides were identified and compared by immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Infected and mock-infected 17Cl-1 cells were pretreated with actinomycin D and labeled with [35S]methionine. Polypeptides in Nonidet P-40 cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with homologous and heterologous antisera. Identical polypeptides were precipitated from A59-, SD-, or SK-infected cell extracts by SD, SK, OC43, or A59 antisera. The polypeptides of human virus 229E were antigenically distinct, with the exception of weak recognition of a polypeptide of 50,000 molecular weight. We conclude that the two multiple sclerosis virus isolates SK and SD are closely related serologically to the murine coronavirus A59 and the human coronavirus OC43.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
