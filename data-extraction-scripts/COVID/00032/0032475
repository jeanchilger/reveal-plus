Isolated E2 consisted of rosettes of peplomers, whereas E1, the membrane glycoprotein, was irregular and amorphous. Under certain conditions significant interactions occurred between components of Nonidet P-40-disrupted virions. Incubation of the Nonidet P-40-disrupted virus at 37 degrees C resulted in formation of a complex between one of the viral glycoproteins, E1, and the viral nucleocapsid. This was caused by a temperature-dependent conformational change in E1, resulting in aggregation of E1 and interaction with the viral RNA in the nucleocapsid. E1 also bound rRNA. The E1-nucleocapsid complexes can be distinguished on sucrose and Renografin density gradients from native viral nucleocapsids. The separation of the membrane glycoprotein E1 from the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 permitted preparation of antisera against these isolated proteins. A model is proposed for the arrangement of the three major structural proteins in the coronavirus A59 virion in relation to the viral envelope and RNA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
