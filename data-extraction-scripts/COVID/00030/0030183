However, non-specialist such as authorities and the general population face several problems to understand the real thread of this pandemic, and under/overestimation of its risk are a commonplace in the press and social media.

Its value is 0 if there is no extra strain in the healthcare system, and it reaches 1.0 when the collapse is imminent.
