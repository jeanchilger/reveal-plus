<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Estimating Preventable COVID19 Infections Related to Elective Outpatient Surgery in Washington State: A Quantitative Model</TITLE><BODY>Background: As the number of suspected and confirmed COVID19 cases in the US continues to rise, the US surgeon general, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and several specialty societies have issued recommendations to consider canceling elective surgeries. However, these recommendations have also faced controversy and opposition. Objective: The goal of this study is to provide a quantitative analysis and model for preventable COVID19 infections from elective outpatient or ambulatory surgery cases, which can also be adapted to analyze COVID19 transmission in other healthcare settings. Furthermore, given the controversy over the appropriate handling of elective surgical cases during this pandemic, we hope that our results may have a positive impact on health policy and public health. Methods: Using previously published information on elective ambulatory or outpatient surgical procedures and publicly available data on COVID19 infections in the US and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we calculated a transmission rate and generated a mathematical model to predict a lower bound for the number of healthcare-acquired COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling or postponing elective outpatient surgeries in Washington state. Results: Our model predicts that over the course of 30 days, at least 2445 preventable patient infections and at least 1557 preventable healthcare worker (HCW) infections would occur in WA state alone if elective outpatient procedures were to continue as usual. The majority of these infections are caused by transmission from HCW who became infected at work. Conclusion: Given the large numbers of COVID19 infections that could be prevented by canceling elective outpatient surgeries, our findings support the recommendations of the US Surgeon General, CDC, American College of Surgeons (ACS), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) to consider rescheduling or postponing elective surgeries until the COVID19 pandemic is under better control in the US.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
