<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE): A Rapidly deployable system to expand ventilator capacity</TITLE><BODY>The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming healthcare systems worldwide. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdependencies within the respiratory circuit. Here we demonstrate through simulated and in vivo pig evaluation the capacity of the iSAVE to support a range of respiratory clinical states. By leveraging off-the-shelf components that are readily available to intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, the iSAVE could potentially be translated for human application to expand the ventilation capacity of hospitals using existing ventilators, minimizing the need to procure additional ventilators.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
