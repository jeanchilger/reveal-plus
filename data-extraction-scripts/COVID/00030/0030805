Here, I present the characterization of RNA sequences corresponding to the first virus associated with Aplysia californica . Genome structure and domain architecture suggest that the identified virus is a novel member of Nidovirales . The proposed aplysia californica nido-like virus (AcNV), with a genome sequence of ca.35,906 nt, represents the longest ever recorded RNA virus yet. Phylogenetic insights indicate that AcNV clusters in a major phylloclade of unclassified invertebrate nidoviruses, Roniviridae , and Mesoniviridae . Basal branching in this emerging cluster could indicate that AcNV is a member of a novel divergent clade within Nidovirales . Further, virus RNA detection in multiple independent studies suggests that AcNV is neurotropic with a broad cell/tissue/organ tropism, supported by AcNV occurrence in diverse organs, including the first detection of a Nidovirales in single specific neurons.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
