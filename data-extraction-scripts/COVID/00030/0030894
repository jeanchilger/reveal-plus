To understand the mechanism of this protein synthesis reprogramming, we examined 2-5AMD in human cells. 2-5AMD triggers polysome collapse characteristic of a translation initiation defect, but translation initiation complexes and ribosomes purified from the translation-arrested cells remain functional. Using spike-in RNA-seq we found that basal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) rapidly decay, while mRNAs encoding IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes evade 2-5AMD and accumulate. The IFN evasion results from the combined effect of better mRNA stability and positive feedback amplification in the IFN response. Therefore, 2-5AMD and transcription act in concert to revamp the cellular mRNA composition. The resulting preferential accumulation of innate immune mRNAs establishes 'prioritized' synthesis of defense proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
