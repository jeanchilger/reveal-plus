Clinical algorithms to identify children who are likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment remain suboptimal. Biomarkers that accurately identify serious bacterial infection (SBI) could improve diagnosis and clinical management. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) and neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) are neutrophil-derived biomarkers associated with bacterial infection.MethodsWe evaluated LCN2 and MMP-8 as candidate biomarkers in 40 healthy controls and 151 febrile children categorised confirmed SBI, probable SBI, or viral infection. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 and MMP-8 to predict SBI was estimated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared to the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP).ResultsPlasma LCN2 and MMP-8 concentration were predictive of SBI. The AUROC (95% CI) for LCN2, MMP8 and CRP to predict SBI was 0.88 (0.82-0.94); 0.80 (0.72-0.87) and 0.89 (0.84-0.94), respectively. The diagnostic performance of LCN2 in combination with CRP was significantly superior to either marker alone: AUROC 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96).ConclusionLCN2 is a sensitive and specific predictor of SBI in children which could be used to improve clinical management and antimicrobial stewardship. LCN2 should be further evaluated in prospective clinical studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
