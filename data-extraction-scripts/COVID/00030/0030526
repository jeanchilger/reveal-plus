We aimed to demonstrate the effect of anti-COVID-19 agent remdesivir on renal fibrosis.MethodsRemdesivir and its active nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 were used to treat TGF-β stimulated renal fibroblasts (NRK-49F) and human renal epithelial cells (HK2). Cell viability was determined by CCK8 assay, and fibrotic markers were measured by Western blotting. Vehicle or remdesivir were given by intraperitoneal injection or renal injection through the left ureter in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Serum and kidneys were harvested. The concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 were measured using LC-MS/MS. Renal and liver function were assessed. Renal fibrosis was evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining and Western blotting.ResultsRemdesivir and GS-441524 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of fibrotic markers (fibronectin, pSmad3, and aSMA) in NRK-49F and HK2 cells. Intraperitoneal injection or renal injection of remdesivir attenuated renal fibrosis of UUO kidneys. Renal and liver function were not changed in remdesivir treated UUO mice. Remdesivir can not be detected, but two remdesivir metabolites were detected after injection.ConclusionRemdesivir inhibits renal fibrosis in obstructed kidneys.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
