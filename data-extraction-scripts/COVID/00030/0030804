The outcome of NP-cell interaction is dictated by the type and magnitude of the NP insult and the cellular response. Here, we have systematically studied the impact of minor differences in NP composition on cellular stress responses and viability by using highly similar poly(alkylcyanoacrylate) (PACA) particles. Surprisingly, PACA particles differing only in their alkyl side chains; butyl (PBCA), ethylbutyl (PEBCA), or octyl (POCA), respectively, induced different stress responses and modes of cell death in human cell lines. POCA particles induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. In contrast, PBCA and PEBCA particles induced lipid peroxidation by depletion of the main cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH), in a manner depending on the levels of the GSH precursor cystine, and transcription of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 regulated by ATF4 and Nrf2. Intriguingly, these particles activated the recently discovered cell death mechanism ferroptosis, which constitutes a promising alternative for targeting multidrug-resistant cancer stem-like cells. Of the two, PBCA was the strongest inducer. In summary, our findings highlight the cellular sensitivity to nanoparticle composition and have important implications for the choice of PACA monomer in therapeutical settings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
