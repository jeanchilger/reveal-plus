Unfortunately, there is no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against the virus until now. Identification of new anti-ASFV drugs is urgently needed. Here, an up-to-date set of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of PPIs from multiple sources. Thirty-two swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as AIPs. They were found to play a central role in the swine PPI network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of AIPs also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted AIPs and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on AIPs were identified, such as Polaprezinc. This work could not only deepen our understanding towards the ASFV-swine interactions, but also help for the development of effective antiviral drugs against the ASFVs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
