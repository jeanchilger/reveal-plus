Due to their low abundance in cells, sequencing-based studies of pre-miRNAs have been limited. We successfully enriched for and deep sequenced pre-miRNAs in human cells by capturing these RNAs during their interaction with Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Using this approach, we detected > 350 pre-miRNAs in human cells and > 250 pre-miRNAs in a reanalysis of a similar study in mouse cells. We uncovered widespread trimming and non-templated additions to the 3’ ends of pre- and mature miRNAs. Additionally, we created an index for microRNA precursor processing efficiency. This analysis revealed a subset of pre-miRNAs that produce low levels of mature miRNAs despite abundant precursors, including an annotated miRNA in the 5’ UTR of the DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 mRNA transcript. This led us to search for AGO-associated stem-loops originating from other mRNA species, which identified hundreds of putative pre-miRNAs derived from human and mouse mRNAs. In summary, we provide a wealth of information on mammalian pre-miRNAs, and identify novel microRNA and microRNA-like elements localized in mRNAs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
