Regardless of this measure the new infection has spread to several countries around the world. Here, we developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by the airline routes and we give estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreaks to the different cities. In this work we show an analysis of the dispersion of this infection to other cities by airlines based on the classic model the Kermack and McKendrick complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes which represent the cities and edges which represent the airline routes. We do several numerical simulations to estimate the date of arrival to different cities starting the infection at Wuhan, China and to show the robustness of the estimation respect to changes in the epidemiological parameters and to changes on the graph. We use Mexico City as an example. In this case, our estimate of the arrival time is between March 20 and March 30, 2020. This analysis is limited to the analysis of dispersion by airlines, so this estimate should be taken as an overestimate since the infection can arrive by other means. This model estimates the arrival of the infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and March 30. This estimation gives a time period to implement and strengthen preventive measures aimed at the general population, as well as to strengthen hospital infrastructure and training of human resources in health.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
