This combination makes every first S phase underlicensed and hypersensitive to replication stress.ABSTRACTTo maintain tissue homeostasis, cells transition between cell cycle quiescence and proliferation. An essential G1 process is Minichromosome Maintenance complex (MCM) loading at DNA replication origins to prepare for S phase, known as origin licensing. A p53-dependent origin licensing checkpoint normally ensures sufficient MCM loading prior to S phase entry. We used quantitative flow cytometry and live cell imaging to compare MCM loading during the long first G1 upon cell cycle entry and the shorter G1 phases in the second and subsequent cycles. We discovered that despite the longer G1 phase, the first G1 after cell cycle re-entry is significantly underlicensed. As a result, the first S phase cells are hypersensitive to replication stress. This underlicensing is from a combination of slow MCM loading with a severely compromised origin licensing checkpoint. The hypersensitivity to replication stress increases over repeated rounds of quiescence. Thus, underlicensing after cell cycle re-entry from quiescence distinguishes a higher risk cell cycle that promotes genome instability.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
