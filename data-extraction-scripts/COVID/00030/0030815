Given variable rates of vaccine efficacy and antiviral resistance, alternative strategies are urgently required to improve disease outcomes. Here we describe the use of HiSeq deep sequencing to analyze host gene expression in primary human alveolar epithelial type II cells infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. At 24 hours post-infection, 623 host genes were significantly up-regulated, including the cell adhesion moleculeCEACAM1. The up-regulation ofCEACAM1was blocked in the presence of the reactive oxygen species inhibitor, apocynin. H5N1 virus infection stimulated significantly higher CEACAM1 protein expression when compared to low pathogenic PR8 H1N1 virus, suggesting a key role for CEACAM1 in influenza virus pathogenicity. Furthermore, silencing of endogenousCEACAM1resulted in reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, as well as reduced levels of virus replication following H5N1 infection. Our study provides evidence for the involvement of CEACAM1 in a clinically relevant model of H5N1 infection and may assist in the development of host-oriented antiviral strategies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
