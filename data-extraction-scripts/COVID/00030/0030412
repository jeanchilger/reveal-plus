<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF THE ASRM GUIDELINES ON FERTILITY PATIENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC</TITLE><BODY>Objective: To survey fertility patients' agreement with ASRM recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the emotional impact on them. Design: An online survey was sent to current fertility patients Setting: New York City academic fertility practice at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic Patient(s): Fertility patients seen within the last year Intervention(s): None Main Outcome Measure(s): Patient agreement with the ASRM recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the emotional impact rated on a Likert scale Result(s): A total of 518 patients completed the survey for a response rate of 17%. Fifty percent of respondents had a cycle canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those who had a cycle cancelled, 85% of respondents found it to be moderately to extremely upsetting with 22% rating it to be equivalent to the loss of a child. There was no difference on the emotional impact based on the type of cycle cancelled. Fifty-five percent of patients agreed that diagnostic procedures such as hysterosalpingograms should be cancelled while 36% of patients agreed all fertility cycles should be cancelled. Patients were slightly more likely to agree with the ASRM guidelines if they have an upcoming cycle cancelled (p = 0.041). Of all respondents 82% would have preferred to have the option to start a treatment cycle in consultation with their doctor. Conclusion(s): Given the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the physical, financial and emotional impact of this unprecedented threat cannot be underestimated in our fertility patients. Key Word(s): COVID-19, novel coronavirus, ASRM, mental health, infertility&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
