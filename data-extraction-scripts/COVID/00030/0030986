Expression of their genes is promoted through reading of genomic RNA and mRNA transcripts by the ribosome of the infected cell. The 5’-end of these RNAs is supposedly protected by an RNA-cap structure (m7GpppNm) whose most synthesis steps remain elusive. In Eukaryotes, the RNA-cap structure is methylated by RNA methyltransferases (MTases) at the RNA-cap N7-guanine position as well as the 2’-O methyl position of the first transcribed nucleotide. In Coronaviridae, two separate enzymes (nsp14 and nsp16) perform the N7-guanine and the 2’-OH methylation, respectively. One salient feature of the Nidovirales N7-guanine MTase nsp14 is that it is the only example of non-Rossman fold viral MTase known so far. Conversely, all other Nidovirales nsp16-like MTases have a canonical Rossman fold. Many Nidovirales members lack either any RNA MTase signature sequence (e.g., Arteriviridae), or lack a N7-guanine MTase signature sequence (e.g., Tobaniviridae, Euroniviridae, Roniviridae, Medioniviridae). Both nsp14-and nsp16-like enzyme genes are usually located in Orf1b encoding for the replication machinery. Here, we report the discovery of a putative Rossman fold RNA MTase in the Orf1a of ten Tobaniviridae members. Multiple sequence alignments and structural analyses identify this novel gene as a typical RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase with substrate specificity and active-site organization similar to the canonical eukaryotic RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
