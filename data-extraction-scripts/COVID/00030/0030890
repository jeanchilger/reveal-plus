In response, they release interferons (IFNs) and activate a ubiquitously expressed pseudokinase/endoribonuclease RNase L. RNase L executes regulated RNA decay and halts global translation. Here we developed a biosensor for 2’,5’-oligoadenylate (2-5A), the natural activator of RNase L. We found that 2-5A was acutely synthesized by cells in response to dsRNA sensing, which immediately triggered cellular RNA cleavage by RNase L and arrested host protein synthesis. However, translation-arrested cells still transcribed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and secreted IFNs of types I and III (IFN-β and IFN-λ). Our data suggests that IFNs escape from the action of RNase L on translation. We propose that 2-5A/RNase L pathway serves to rapidly and accurately suppress basal protein synthesis, preserving privileged production of defense proteins of the innate immune system.SignificanceRNase L is a mammalian enzyme that can stop global protein synthesis during interferon response. Cells must balance the need to make interferons (which are proteins) with the risk to lose cell-wide translation due to RNase L. This balance can most simply be achieved if RNase L was activated late in the interferon response. However, we show by engineering a biosensor for the RNase L pathway, that on the contrary, RNase L activation precedes interferon synthesis. Further, translation of interferons evades the action of RNase L. Our data suggest that RNase L facilitates a switch of protein synthesis from homeostasis to specific needs of innate immune signaling.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
