After propensity score matching with demographics, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of parturients with or without COVID−19 were analysed. The anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes of themselves and their infants were compared in these two groups of parturients. Results: A total of 1,588 patients without SARS−CoV−2 infection undergoing cesarean delivery were retrospectively included. After achieving a balanced cohort through propensity score matching, 89 patients (COVID−19 group), who were diagnosed with COVID−19 by SARS−CoV−2 nucleic acid test and CT scan matched with 173 patients without COVID−19 (Control group). The SARS−CoV−2 infected parturients in the early stages of COVID−19 outbreak was much more than during the later stage. The main clinical characteristics of parturients with COVID−19 were fever (34.8%), cough (33.7%), an increased plasma CRP (52.8%) and a decreased lymphocyte counting (33.7%). A high rate of emergency and a high incidence of anaesthesia-related complications, such as pharyngalgia, multiple puncture, intraoperative hypotension, nausea, vomiting, vertigo and chills in the COVID−19 parturients. In addition, the parturients with COVID−19 had a long duration of operation and hospital stay, and an increased intraoperative oxytocin utilization and postoperative oxygen therapy. The newborns from the SARS−CoV−2 infected mothers, who received general anaesthesia, had a high risk of Apgar score ≤8 at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery and a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Conclusions: Anaesthesia−related complications occur more frequently in the COVID−19 parturients and their newborns have a high risk of distress.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
