This virus was named the Mogiana tick virus (MGTV). Later, MGTV was also named as Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), Kindia tick virus (KDTV), Guangxi tick virus (GXTV) etc. In the present study, we used small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) to detect viruses in ticks and detected MGTV in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks, which had been captured in Yunnan province of China in the year of 2016. The full-length genome sequence of a new MGTV strain Yunnan2016 (GenBank: MT080097, MT080098, MT080099 and MT080100) was obtained and recommended to be included into the NCBI RefSeq database for the future studies of MGTV. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that viruses named MGTV, JMTV, KDTV and GXTV are monophyletic: the MGTV group (lineage) of viruses. We show, for the first time, that 5′ and 3′ sRNAs can be used to obtain full-length sequences of the 5’ and 3’ ends of, but not limited to genome sequences of RNA viruses. And we proved the feasibility of using the sRNA-seq based method for the detection of viruses in a sample containing miniscule RNA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
