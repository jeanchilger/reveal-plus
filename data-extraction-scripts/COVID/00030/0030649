We demonstrated that self-sampling with foam swabs at home is well-tolerated and provides quantitative viral output concordant with flocked swabs. Nasal cytokine levels correlate and cluster according to immune cell of origin. Periods of stable viral loads are followed by rapid elimination, which could be coupled with cytokine expansion and contraction using mathematical models. Nasal foam swab self-sampling at home provides a precise, mechanistic readout of respiratory virus shedding and local immune responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
