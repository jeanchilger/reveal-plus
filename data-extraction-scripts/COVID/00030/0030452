<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Predicting Mortality Risk in Patients with COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence to Help Medical Decision-Making</TITLE><BODY>In the wake of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we designed and developed a predictive model based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to determine the health risk and predict the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19. In this study, we used documented data of 117,000 patients world-wide with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This study proposes an AI model to help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care. The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate. We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. In this study, the most alarming symptoms and features were also identified. Finally, we used a separate dataset of COVID-19 patients to evaluate our developed model accuracy, and used confusion matrix to make an in-depth analysis of our classifiers and calculate the sensitivity and specificity of our model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
