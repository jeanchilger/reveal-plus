Here we report SmartBac, an easy and versatile system for constructing large-sized transfer plasmids used to generate recombinant baculoviruses that express large multiprotein complexes in insect cells. The SmartBac system integrates the univector plasmid-fusion system, Gibson assembly method and polyprotein strategy to construct the final transfer plasmids. The fluorescent proteins are designed to be co-expressed with recombinant proteins to monitor transfection and expression efficiencies. A scheme of screening an optimal tagged subunit for effective purification is provided. Six large multiprotein complexes including the human exocyst complex and dynactin complex were successfully expressed, suggesting a great potential of SmartBac for its wide application in the future structural biology study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
