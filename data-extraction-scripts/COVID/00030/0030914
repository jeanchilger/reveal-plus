Two types of recombinant porcine EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C/3A genes, while PLPC gene replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3 kb-long upstream flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the downstream ~0.9 kb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G. Although the phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two recombinant EV-Gs have independently evolved, type 1 recombinant EV-G might have served as a helper virus by providing viral structural proteins for dissemination of the type 2 recombinant EV-G.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
