Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising platform for vaccination. Here, we systematically investigated the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, we identified the optimal combination of 5′ and 3′ UTR, termed as NASAR, which was five to ten-fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid-derived nanoparticles showed dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens both in vitro and in vivo. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
