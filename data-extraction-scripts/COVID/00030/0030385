<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Current State and Predicting Future Scenario of Highly Infected Nations for COVID-19 Pandemic</TITLE><BODY>Since the first report of COVID-19 from Wuhan China, the virus has rapidly spread across the globe now presently reported in 177 countries with positive cases crossing 400 thousand and rising. In the current study, prediction is made for highly infected countries by a simple and novel method using only cumulative positive cases reported. The rate of infection per week (R_w) coefficient delineated three phases for the current COVID-19 pandemic. All the countries under study have passed Phase 1 and are currently in Phase 2 except for South Korea which is in Phase 3. Early detection with rapid and large-scale testing helps in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Staying in Phase 2 for longer period would lead to increase in COVID-19 positive cases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
