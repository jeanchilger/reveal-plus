Long-term success of an antiviral therapeutic is determined not only by its efficacy but also by the duration of time required for drug-resistance to evolve. We have developed a microfluidic device comprised of ~6000 wells, with each well containing a microstructure to capture single cells. We have used this device to characterize enterovirus inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action. In contrast to population methods, single-cell analysis reveals that each class of inhibitor interferes with the viral infection cycle in a manner that can be distinguished by principal component analysis. Single-cell analysis of antiviral candidates reveals not only efficacy but also properties of the members of the viral population most sensitive to the drug, the stage of the lifecycle most affected by the drug, and perhaps even if the drug targets an interaction of the virus with its host.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
