In this study, we report the occurrence and co-occurrence of different virus types and subtypes among the patients arriving at the pediatric emergency room of New York Presbyterian Hospital, a major urban hospital. Methods: We collected nasal swabs from the patients and their accompanying persons. We also recorded the levels (None, Mild, High, and Severe) of their symptoms (Fever, Chill, Muscle Pain, Watery Eye, Runny Nose, Sneezing, Sore throat and Cough). The collected swabs were tested for the presence of common viruses infecting the respiratory tract. Results: Human Rhinovirus was the most common virus among the patients, followed Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Human Rhinovirus was most common in summer, autumn and spring. In contrast, influenza was more common in winter. Further, Influenza A virus was more likely to co-occur with Corona Virus 229E. In comparison, Influenza was less likely to co-occur with Human Rhinovirus. Moreover, Influenza, Parainfluenza and Corona virus were associated with more severe symptoms, while Human Rhinovirus was associated with less severe symptoms. In addition, we observed that Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus were more likely to infect a patient when these viruses also infected the accompanying person. We also found that it was difficult to distinguish among viruses based on the symptoms. The inability to distinguish among different virus types and subtypes is explained by the fact that multiple viruses lead to similar symptoms. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide a better understanding of respiratory viral infections in small children presenting at a pediatric emergency room in New York.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
