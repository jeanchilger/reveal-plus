Considering the severity of infection and the associated mortalities, there is an urgent need to develop an effective preventive measure against this virus. In this study, we have designed a novel vaccine construct using computational strategies. Spike (S) glycoprotein is the major antigenic component that trigger the host immune responses. Detailed investigation of S protein with various immunoinformatics tools enabled us to identify 5 MHC I and 5 MHC II B-cell derived T-cell epitopes with VaxiJen score > 1 and IC50 value < 100nM. These epitopes were joined with a suitable adjuvant and appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope based vaccine construct. Further, in silico testing of the vaccine construct for its antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and other physicochemical properties showed it to be safe and immunogenic. Suitable tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was generated using 3Dpro of SCRATCH suite, refined with GalaxyRefine, and validated with ProSA, PROCHECK, and ERRAT server. Finally, molecular docking studies were performed to ensure a favorable binding affinity between the vaccine construct and TLR3 receptor. The designed multi-epitope vaccine showed potential to elicit specific immune responses against the SARS-COV-2. However, further wet lab validation is necessary to confirm the actual effectiveness, safety and immunogenic potency of the vaccine construct against derived in this study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
