The olfactory (piriform) cortex has long been hypothesized to encode odor memories, yet the cellular substrates for olfactory learning and memory remain unknown. Here, using intersectional, cFos-based genetic manipulations (“Fos-tagging”), we show that olfactory fear conditioning activates sparse and distributed ensembles of neurons in mouse piriform cortex. We demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of these Fos-tagged piriform ensembles selectively interferes with odor fear memory retrieval, but does not compromise basic odor detection and discrimination. Furthermore, chemogenetic reactivation of piriform neurons that were Fos-tagged during olfactory fear conditioning causes a decrease in exploratory behavior, mimicking odor-evoked fear memory recall. Together, our experiments identify odor-specific ensembles of piriform neurons as necessary and sufficient for odor fear memory recall.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
