A detailed scientific analysis of this phenomenon is still to come, but now it is urgently needed to evaluate the disease dynamics in order to organize the appropriate quarantine activities, to estimate the required number of places in hospitals, the level of individual protection, the rate of isolation of infected persons, etc. South Korea has achieved the stabilization of the number of cases at rather low level.
