This version now contains manually curated binding data for 7085 mutations, an increase of 133%, including changes in kinetics for 1844 mutations, enthalpy and entropy changes for 443 mutations, and 440 mutations which abolish detectable binding.AvailabilityThe database is available at https://life.bsc.es/pid/skempi2/&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
