Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We systematically reviewed the published literature reporting seroprevalence and/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary populations from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, including 60 studies in our qualitative syntheses. MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80-100% in adult dromedaries supporting geographically wide spread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further investigation – particularly of dromedary movement – and inform vaccination strategy design.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
