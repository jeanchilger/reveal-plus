This innovative and general procedure, based on the representation of the molecular iso-electron density surface in terms of 2D Zernike polynomials, allows the rapid and quantitative assessment of the geometrical shape complementarity between interacting proteins, that was unfeasible with previous methods. We first tested the method with a large dataset of known protein complexes obtaining an overall area under the ROC curve of 0.69 in the blind recognition of binding sites and then applied it to investigate the features of the interaction between the Spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 and human cellular receptors. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 uses a dual strategy: its spike protein could also interact with sialic acid receptors of the cells in the upper airways, in addition to the known interaction with Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
