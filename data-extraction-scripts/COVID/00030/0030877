Using 5’, 3’ and intronic sRNAs, we revealed that the enzymatic dsRNA cleavage and RNAi could involve in the RNA degradation and gene expression regulation of U1 snRNA in human. The further study of 5’, 3’ and intronic sRNAs help rediscover double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) cleavage, RNA interference (RNAi) and the regulation of gene expression, which challenges the classical theories. In this study, we provided a simple and cost effective way for the annotation of mitochondrial and nuclear non-coding genes and the identification of new steady-state RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). We also provided a different point of view for cancer and virus, based on the new discoveries of dsRNA cleavage, RNAi and the regulation of gene expression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
