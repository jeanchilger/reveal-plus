N-linked glycosylation is involved in stability and function of these proteins and occurs at Asn residues. In several organs, profiles of N-glycans have been determined by comprehensive analyses. Nevertheless, the cochlea of the mammalian inner ear, a tiny organ mediating hearing, has yet to be examined. Here, we focused on the stria vascularis, an epithelial-like tissue in the cochlea, and characterised N-glycans by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. This hypervascular tissue not only expresses several ion transporters and channels to control the electrochemical balance in the cochlea but also harbours different transporters and receptors that maintain structure and activity of the organ. Seventy-nine N-linked glycans were identified in the rat stria vascularis. Among these, in 55 glycans, the complete structures were determined; in the other 24 species, partial glycosidic linkage patterns and full profiles of the monosaccharide composition were identified. In the process of characterisation, several sialylated glycans were subjected sequentially to two different alkylamidation reactions; this derivatisation helped to distinguish α2,3-linkage and α2,6-linkage sialyl isomers with mass spectrometry. These data should accelerate elucidation of the molecular architecture of the cochlea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
