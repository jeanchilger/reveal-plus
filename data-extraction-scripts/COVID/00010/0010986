How translation initiation factors regulate rotavirus infection remains poorly understood. In this study, the knockdown of the components of the eIF4F complex using shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 were performed, respectively. We have demonstrated that loss-of-function of the three components of eIF4F, including eIF4A, eIF4E and eIF4G, remarkably promotes the levels of rotavirus genomic RNA and viral protein VP4. Consistently, knockdown of the negative regulator of eIF4F and programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) inhibits the expression of viral mRNA and the VP4 protein. Mechanically, we confirmed that the silence of the eIF4F complex suppressed the protein level of IRF1 and IRF7 that exert potent antiviral effects against rotavirus infection. Thus, these results demonstrate that the eIF4F complex is an essential host factor restricting rotavirus replication, revealing new targets for the development of new antiviral strategies against rotavirus infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
