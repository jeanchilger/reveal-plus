The many different biological pathways comprising the response to infection in lungs that are influenced by aging are complex and remain to be defined more thoroughly. Towards finding new directions in research on aging, we aimed to define biological pathways in the acute response to RSV that are affected in the lungs by aging. We therefore profiled the full transcriptome of lung tissue of mice prior to and during RSV infection both at young and old age. In the absence of RSV, we found aging to downregulate genes that are involved in constitution of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, uninfected old mice showed elevated expression of pathways that resemble injury, metabolic aberrations, and disorders mediated by functions of the immune system that were induced at young age only by an exogenous trigger like RSV. Furthermore, infection by RSV mounted stronger activation of anti-viral type-I interferon pathways at old age. Despite such exaggerated anti-viral responses, old mice showed reduced control of virus. Altogether, our findings emphasize important roles in aging-related susceptibility to respiratory disease for extracellular matrix dysfunctions and dysregulated immune activation in lungs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
