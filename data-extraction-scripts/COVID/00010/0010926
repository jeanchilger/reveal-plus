We aimed to determine the contribution of common pathogens to pneumonia adjusting for rates of asymptomatic detection to inform future diagnosis, treatment and preventive strategies. METHODS: A case–control study was conducted among children <18 years in Perth, Western Australia. Cases were children hospitalised with radiologically confirmed pneumonia; controls were healthy children identified from outpatient and local immunisation clinics. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for 14 respiratory viruses and 6 bacterial species by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For each pathogen, adjusted odds ratio (aOR; 95% CI) was calculated using multivariate logistic regression and population-attributable fraction (95% CI) for pneumonia was estimated. RESULTS: From May 2015 to October 2017, 230 cases and 230 controls were enrolled. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 57% of cases and 29% of controls (aOR: 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8 to 7.8). At least one bacterial species was detected in 72% of cases and 80% of controls (aOR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection was most strongly associated with pneumonia (aOR: 58.4; 95% CI: 15.6 to 217.5). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the only bacteria associated with pneumonia (aOR: 14.5; 95% CI: 2.2 to 94.8). We estimated that RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza, adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were responsible for 20.2% (95% CI: 14.6 to 25.5), 9.8% (5.6% to 13.7%), 6.2% (2.5% to 9.7%), 4% (1.1% to 7.1%) and 7.2% (3.5% to 10.8%) of hospitalisations for childhood pneumonia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses, particularly RSV and HMPV, are major contributors to pneumonia in Australian children.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
