In this respect, targeted antibiotic prescribing by general practitioners would help reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics, leading to reduced treatment failures, fewer side-effects for patients and a reduction in the (global) spread of antibiotic resistances. Current ‘gold standard’ antibiotic resistance detection strategies tend to be slow, taking up to 48 h to obtain a result, although the implementation of point-of-care testing by general practitioners could help achieve the goal of targeted antibiotic prescribing practices. However, deciding on which antibiotic resistances to include in a point-of-care diagnostic is not a trivial task, as outlined in this publication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
