BST-2 inhibits viral replication by preventing virus budding from the plasma membrane and by inducing an antiviral state in cells adjacent to infection via unique inflammatory signaling mechanisms. This review presents the first comprehensive summary of what is currently known about BST-2 antiviral function against respiratory viruses, how these viruses construct countermeasures to antagonize BST-2, and how BST-2 function might be targeted to develop therapies to treat respiratory virus infections. We address the current gaps in knowledge, including the need for mechanistic understanding of BST-2 antagonism by respiratory viruses, that should be bridged to achieve that goal.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
