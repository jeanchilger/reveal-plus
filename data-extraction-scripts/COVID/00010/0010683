Here, we show that IFITM proteins regulate murine CD4(+) Th cell differentiation. Ifitm2 and Ifitm3 are expressed in wild‐type (WT) CD4(+) T cells. On activation, Ifitm3 was downregulated and Ifitm2 was upregulated. Resting Ifitm‐family‐deficient CD4(+) T cells had higher expression of Th1‐associated genes than WT and purified naive Ifitm‐family‐deficient CD4(+) T cells differentiated more efficiently to Th1, whereas Th2 differentiation was inhibited. Ifitm‐family‐deficient mice, but not Ifitm3‐deficient mice, were less susceptible than WT to induction of allergic airways disease, with a weaker Th2 response and less severe disease and lower Il4 but higher Ifng expression and IL‐27 secretion. Thus, the Ifitm family is important in adaptive immunity, influencing Th1/Th2 polarization, and Th2 immunopathology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
