Using directed evolution and site-directed mutagenesis, it was possible to generate a human single-chain antibody fragment with a broad cross-reactivity that retained recognition for its original antigen. This variant is the first antibody fragment that neutralizes the effect of an estimated 13 neurotoxins present in the venom of nine species of Mexican scorpions. This single antibody fragment showed the properties of a polyvalent antivenom. These results represent a significant advance in the development of new antivenoms against scorpion stings, since the number of components would be minimized due to their broad cross-neutralization capacity, while at the same time bypassing animal immunization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
