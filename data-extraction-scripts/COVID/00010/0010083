However, when human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are transferred into NOG (NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2rg (null)) mice, severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) hinders long term detailed analysis. Administration of human PBMCs into newly developed murine MHC class I- and class II-deficient NOG (NOG-dKO; NOG- Iab, B2m-double-knockout) mice showed sufficient engraftment of human immune cells with little sign of GVHD. Immunization with influenza vaccine resulted in an increase in influenza-specific human IgG Ab, indicating induction of antigen-specific B cells in the NOG-dKO mice. Immunization with human dendritic cells pulsed with HLA-A2 restricted cytomegalovirus peptide induced specific cytotoxic T cells, indicating the induction of antigen-specific T cells in the NOG-dKO mice. Adoptive cell therapies (ACTs) using melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1)-specific TCR-transduced activated T cells showed strong tumor growth inhibition in NOG-dKO mice without any sign of GVHD accompanied by preferential expansion of the transferred MART-1-specific T cells. ACTs using cultured human melanoma infiltrating T cells also showed anti-tumor effects against autologous melanoma cells in NOG-dKO mice, in which changes in human cancer phenotypes by immune intervention, such as increased CD271 expression, could be evaluated. Therefore, NOG-dKO mice are useful tools for more detailed analysis of both the induction and effector phases of T-cell and B-cell responses for a longer period than regular NOG mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
