Nitric oxide (NO), as an important signaling molecule, has antiviral activity on some viruses. To date, there is little information on the role of NO during PCV2 infection. RESULTS: We used indirect fluorescence assay (IFA), TCID(50), real-time RT-qPCR and western blot assay to reveal the role of NO in restricting PCV2 replication. PCV2 replication was inhibited by a form of NO, NO(•), whereas PCV2 was not susceptible to another form of NO, NO(+). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the form of NO(•) has a potential role in the fight against PCV2 infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
