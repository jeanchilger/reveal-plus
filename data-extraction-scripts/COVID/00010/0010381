It has also been associated with kidney damage in the broiler flocks. The aim of the present study is to determine the presence of IBV and its possible involvement in kidney damage of broiler chicks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 14 clinically diseased broiler flocks from Western and Central Algeria were sampled and analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by phylogenic analysis. RESULTS: The QX (100%) and 4/91 (60%) IBV serotypes were the most prevalent in the kidney damaged broilers regardless of vaccination status. The molecular detection of avian IBV by RT-PCR identified six samples as positive, of which only two isolates were typable by sequencing. We identified a novel IBDZ13a genotype which showed 93% sequence homology to the partial-S1 gene sequence of the IB 4/91 commercial vaccine strain. Sequencing analysis characterized this virus as a novel and divergent IB 4/91 field virus with eight amino acid substitutions that might have resulted in altered immunogenicity. CONCLUSION: The isolation of a new IBV strain (IBDZ13a) from vaccinated broiler flocks may explain the failure of the vaccination programs against IBV field strains. Combination of the HI test and RT-PCR indicated that the nephropathogenic IB outbreaks in broilers are related to this novel strain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
