Where traditionally vaccine development has been dominated by trial and error, systems vaccinology is a tool that provides novel and comprehensive understanding if properly used. Data sets retrieved from systems‐based studies endorse rational design and effective development of safe and efficacious vaccines. In this review we first describe different omics‐techniques that form the pillars of systems vaccinology. In the second part, the application of systems vaccinology in the different stages of vaccine development is described. Overall, this review shows that systems vaccinology has become an important tool anywhere in the vaccine development chain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
