They are involved in the regulation of important cellular processes, such as signalling, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and in host-virus response, and for this, they are considered as promising therapeutic targets to slow tumour progression and viral pathogenesis. Although extensive work has been carried out with them, including their classification into six distinct phylogenetically clades, little is known on bacterial macrodomains, especially if these latter are able to remove poly(ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) from PARylated proteins, activity that only has been confirmed in human TARG1 (C6orf130) protein. To extend this limited knowledge, we demonstrate, after a comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis, that Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 9817 TARG1 (FmTARG1) is the first bacterial macrodomain shown to have high catalytic efficiency towards O-acyl-ADP-ribose, even more than hTARG1, and towards mono- and poly(ADPribosyl)ated proteins. Surprisingly, FmTARG1 gene is also inserted into a unique operonic context, only shared by the distantly related Fusobacterium perfoetens ATCC 29250 macrodomain, which include an immunity protein 51 domain, typical of bacterial polymorphic toxin systems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
