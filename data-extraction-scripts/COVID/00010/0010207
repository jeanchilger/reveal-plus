With the rapid evolution of the influenza virus, the possibility of novel pandemic remains ever a concern. This review covers our current knowledge of the influenza A virus: on the role of RNA in translation, replication, what is known of the expressed proteins and the protein products generated from alternative splicing, and on the role of base pairing in RNA structure. We highlight the main events associated with viral entry into the cell, the transcription and replication process, an export of the viral genetic material from the nucleus and the final release of the virus. We discuss the observed potential roles of RNA secondary structure (the RNA base-pairing arrangement) and RNA/RNA interactions in this scheme.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
