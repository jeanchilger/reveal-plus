<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-01-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Human Lectins and Their Roles in Viral Infections</TITLE><BODY>Innate recognition of virus proteins is an important component of the immune response to viral pathogens. A component of this immune recognition is the family of lectins; pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognise viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral glycoproteins. In this review we discuss the contribution of soluble and membrane-associated PRRs to immunity against virus pathogens, and the potential role of these molecules in facilitating virus replication. These processes are illustrated with examples of viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Ebola virus (EBOV). We focus on the structure, function and genetics of the well-characterised C-type lectin mannose-binding lectin, the ficolins, and the membrane-bound CD209 proteins expressed on dendritic cells. The potential for lectin-based antiviral therapies is also discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
