<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-02-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Synthesis and Anticancer Activities of Glycyrrhetinic Acid Derivatives</TITLE><BODY>A total of forty novel glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) derivatives were designed and synthesized. The cytotoxic activity of the novel compounds was tested against two human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) in vitro by the MTT method. The evaluation results revealed that, in comparison with GA, compound 42 shows the most promising anticancer activity (IC(50) 1.88 ± 0.20 and 1.37 ± 0.18 μM for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively) and merits further exploration as a new anticancer agent.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
