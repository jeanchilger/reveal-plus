<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-08-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Tuberculosis-associated Immune Thrombocytopenia: A Case Report</TITLE><BODY>Various hematological manifestations are known to occur with tuberculosis (TB), but its association with immune thrombocytopenia is uncommon and not well recognized. Here, the case of a 39-year-old male who presented with a history of epistaxis and hematuria is described. The patient was found to have diffuse lymphadenopathy both clinically and radiologically. He was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia; however, there was a delay in the diagnosis of TB because of the patient's refusal of lymph node biopsy and late recognition of the association between TB and immune thrombocytopenia. Treatment with steroids without antituberculosis medications may have led to reactivation and dissemination of tuberculous infection in this patient. Later, the patient was readmitted with a suspected community-acquired pneumonia and the sputum smear was positive for acid-fast bacilli. Unfortunately, the patient died after he developed sepsis and multiorgan failure. The purpose of this case report is to highlight this rare combination and create awareness among clinicians to consider TB as an underlying etiology of immune thrombocytopenia, especially if there are other associated physical findings such as the presence of lymphadenopathy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
