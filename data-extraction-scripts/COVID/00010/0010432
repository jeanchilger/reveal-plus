In this study, we examined whether the variations of the cis-acting elements between the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Taiwan (TW) strain and the prototype strain CV777 alter gene expression. For this aim, we analyzed the variations of the cis-acting elements in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) between the PEDV TW, CV777, and other reference strains. We also determined the previously unidentified transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), a sequence motif required for coronavirus transcription, and found that a nucleotide deletion in the TW strain, in comparison with CV777 strain, immediately downstream of the leader core sequence alters the identity between the leader TRS and the body TRS. Functional analyses using coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNA revealed that such variations in cis-acting elements for the TW strain compared with the CV777 strain have an influence on the efficiency of gene expression. The current data show for the first time the evolution of PEDV in terms of cis-acting elements and their effects on gene expression, and thus may contribute to our understanding of recent PED outbreaks worldwide.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
