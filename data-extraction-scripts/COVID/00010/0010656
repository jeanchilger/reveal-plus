The spike (S) glycoprotein of PEDV contains multiple neutralizing epitopes and is a major target for PEDV neutralization and vaccine development. To understand the antigenicity of the new PEDV variant, we characterized the neutralizing epitopes of a new genotype 2b PEDV isolate from Taiwan, PEDV Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT), by the generation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NmAbs). Two NmAbs, P4B-1, and E10E-1–10 that recognized the ectodomain of the full-length recombinant PEDV S protein and exhibited neutralizing ability against the PEDV-PT virus were selected. Recombinant truncated S proteins were used to identify the target sequences for the NmAbs and P4B-1 was shown to recognize the C-terminus of CO-26K equivalent epitope (COE) at amino acids (a.a.) 575–639 of the PEDV S. Interestingly, E10E-1–10 could recognize a novel neutralizing epitope at a.a. 435–485 within the S1(A) domain of the PEDV S protein, whose importance and function are yet to be determined. Moreover, both NmAbs could not bind to linearized S proteins, indicating that only conformational epitopes are recognized. This data could improve our understanding of the antigenic structures of the PEDV S protein and facilitate future development of novel epitope-based vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
