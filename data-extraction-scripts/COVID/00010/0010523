<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-02-12</DATELINE><TITLE>International Biological Reference Preparations for Epidemic Infectious Diseases</TITLE><BODY>Recent years have seen unprecedented investment in research and development for countermeasures for high-threat pathogens, including specific and ambitious objectives for development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. The inadequate availability of biological reference materials for these pathogens poses a genuine obstacle in pursuit of these objectives, and the lack of a comprehensive and equitable framework for developing reference materials is a weakness. We outline the need for internationally standardized biological materials for high-threat pathogens as a core element of global health security. We also outline the key components of a framework for addressing this deficiency.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
