In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying and tracking communities in graphs that change over time – dynamic community detection – and present a framework based on Riemannian geometry to aid in this task. Our framework currently supports several important operations such as interpolating between and averaging over graph snapshots. We compare these Riemannian methods with entry-wise linear interpolation and find that the Riemannian methods are generally better suited to dynamic community detection. Next steps with the Riemannian framework include producing a Riemannian least-squares regression method for working with noisy data and developing support methods, such as spectral sparsification, to improve the scalability of our current methods.
