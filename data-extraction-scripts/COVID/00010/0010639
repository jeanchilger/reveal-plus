We observed a complete loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid on the surface of myeloid, erythroid and CD4(+) T cells in Casd1-deficient mice. Although 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on multiple hematopoietic lineages was lost, there were no obvious defects in hematopoiesis. Interestingly, erythrocytes from Casd1-deficient mice also lost reactivity to TER-119, a rat monoclonal antibody that is widely used to mark the murine erythroid lineage. The sialic acid glyco-epitope recognized by TER-119 on erythrocytes was sensitive to the sialic acid O-acetyl esterase activity of the hemagglutinin-esterase from bovine coronavirus but not to the corresponding enzyme from the influenza C virus. During erythrocyte development, TER-119(+) Ery-A and Ery-B cells could be stained by catalytically inactive bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase but not by the inactive influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase, while TER-119(+) Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes were recognized by both virolectins. Although the structure of the sialoglycoconjugate recognized by TER-119 was not chemically demonstrated, its selective binding to virolectins suggests that it may be comprised of a 7,9-di-O-acetyl form of sialic acid. As erythrocytes mature, the surfaces of Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes also acquire an additional distinct CASD1-dependent 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety that can be recognized by virolectins from both influenza C and bovine coronavirus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
