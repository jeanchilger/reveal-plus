In this study, we estimated the parameters of Markov chain by considering the frequencies of occurrence of the all possible amino acid pairs from each alignment-free protein sequence. These estimated Markov chain parameters were used to calculate similarity between two protein sequences based on a fuzzy integral algorithm. For validation, our result was compared with both alignment-based (ClustalW) and alignment-free methods on six benchmark datasets. The results indicate that our developed algorithm has a better clustering performance for protein sequence comparison.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
