Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, causes substantial economic loss in the swine industry worldwide. Previous studies reported miRNA involvement in viral infection; however, their role in regulating PEDV infection remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulatory relationship between miRNA-221-5p and PEDV infection, finding that miR-221-5p overexpression inhibited PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner, and that silencing endogenous miR-221-5p enhanced viral replication. Our results showed that miR-221-5p directly targets the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of PEDV genomic RNA to inhibit PEDV replication, and that miR-221-5p overexpression activates nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling via p65 nuclear translocation, thereby upregulating interferon (IFN)-β, IFN-stimulated gene 15, and MX1 expression during CH/HBTS/2017 infection. We subsequently identified NF-κB-inhibitor α and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, negative regulators of the NF-κB pathway, as miR-221-5p targets. These results demonstrated the ability of miR-221-5p to inhibit PEDV replication by targeting the 3’ UTR of the viral genome and activating the NF-κB-signaling pathway. Our findings will aid the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies for PEDV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
