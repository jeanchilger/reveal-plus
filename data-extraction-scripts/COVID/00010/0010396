METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was distributed among HCWs and trainees who worked or volunteered at the Hajj 2015-2017 through their line managers, or by visiting their hospitals and healthcare centres in Makkah and Mina. Overseas HCWs who accompanied the pilgrims or those who work in foreign Hajj medical missions were excluded. Pearson’s χ(2) test was used to compare categorical variables and odds ratio (OR) was calculated by “risk estimate” statistics along with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: A total of 138 respondents aged 20 to 59 (median 25.6) years with a male to female ratio of 2.5:1 participated in the survey. Only 11.6% (16/138) participants reported receiving all three vaccines, 15.2% (21/138) did not receive any vaccine, 76.1% (105/138) received meningococcal, 68.1% (94/138) influenza and 13.8% (19/138) pneumococcal vaccine. Females were more likely to receive a vaccine than males (OR 3.6, 95%CI: 1.0-12.7, P < 0.05). Willingness to follow health authority’s recommendation was the main reason for receipt of vaccine (78.8%) while believing that they were up-to-date with vaccination (39.8%) was the prime reason for non-receipt. CONCLUSION: Some HCWs at Hajj miss out the compulsory and highly recommended vaccines; lack of awareness is a key barrier and authority’s advice is an important motivator. Health education followed by stringent measures may be required to improve their vaccination rate.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
