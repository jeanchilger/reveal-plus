Patients/Method: In this pre-planned sub-study of the PermiT (Permissive Underfeeding vs. Target Enteral Feeding in Adult Critically Ill Patients) trial, we included critically ill patients who were expected to stay for ≥14 days in the intensive care unit. We measured FFAs level on day 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 of enrollment. Of 70 enrolled patients, 23 (32.8%) patients had high FFAs level (baseline FFAs level >0.45 mmol/L in females and >0.6 mmol/L in males). Results: Patients with high FFAs level were significantly older and more likely to be females and diabetics and they had lower ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, higher creatinine, and higher total cholesterol levels than those with normal FFAs level. During the study period, patients with high FFAs level had higher blood glucose and required more insulin. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the predictors of high baseline FFAs level were diabetes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56, 18.43, p = 0.008) and baseline cholesterol level (aOR, 4.29; 95% CI: 11.64, 11.19, p = 0.003). Serial levels of FFAs did not differ with time between permissive underfeeding and standard feeding groups. FFAs level was not associated with 90-day mortality (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.09, 2.60, p = 0.40). Conclusion: We conclude that high FFAs level in critically ill patients is associated with features of metabolic syndrome and is not affected by short-term permissive underfeeding.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
