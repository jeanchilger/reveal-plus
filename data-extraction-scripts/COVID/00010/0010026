MATERIAL/METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, OA model, and OA + Alprostadil (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/kg, respectively) groups. The ARDS model was induced by femoral vein injection of OA, and alprostadil was administrated immediately. Lung injury was evaluated by lung wet-dry weight ratio (W/D) and histological analyses. Expressions of ACE, inflammatory mediators, apoptotic-related proteins, and proteins in the MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways were determined by Western blot or immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the OA model group had significantly increased W/D, lung injury score, and collagen deposition at 3 h after OA injection. However, alprostadil (10 μg/kg) treatment significantly reduced OA-induced elevation of these indicators. Additionally, OA-induced expression of TNF-α and IL-1β were suppressed by alprostadil. The OA-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF) κB p65 was also reduced by alprostadil. Furthermore, we found that Alprostadil had an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPKs. Alprostadil inhibited Bax but increased Bcl-2, indicating a suppressive role in apoptosis. Remarkably increased expression of ACE in the OA model group was observed, which was decreased by alprostadil. CONCLUSIONS: Alprostadil has a protective effect on ARDS induced by OA in rats, possibly through inhibiting apoptosis, suppressing the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways, and decreasing ACE protein expression. Therefore, the use of alprostadil in clinical ARDS treatment is promising.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
