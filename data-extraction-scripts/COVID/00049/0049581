Entry and release of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is restricted to apical surfaces of polarized epithelial cells, as we have recently shown (J. W. A. Rossen, C. P. J. Bekker, W. F. Voorhout, G. J. A. M. Strous, A. van der Ende, and P. J. M. Rottier, 1994, J. Virol. 68, 7966-7973). In this paper we analyze the interactions of mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59 (MHV-A59) with polarized murine kidney cells (mTAL) grown on permeable supports. After inoculation from the apical or basolateral side, virus entry was found to take place only through the apical membrane. The virus utilized a protein of the carcinoembryonic antigen family as its receptor. In contrast to TGEV, MHV-A59 was released preferentially from the basolateral plasma membrane domain, as evidenced by the accumulation of viral proteins and infectivity in the basolateral culture fluid as well as by electron microscopical observations in the mouse, MHV initially replicates in the nasal epithelium before being disseminated throughout the body; the basolateral release of MHV from epithelial cells into the animal's circulation may be the first step in the establishment of a systemic infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
