It supports the exchange of samples between countries. These exchanges have raised expectations, in many countries, about the sharing of the benefits resulting from these exchanges. About influenza viruses with pandemic potential, the 2011 pandemic influenza preparedness framework Agreement is a response to these expectations. These exchanges are also influenced by the progress made in genetics. The Nagoya Protocol, which came into force in 2014, creates a new framework concerning the use of genetic resources, including about pathogens. It will have a positive impact on public health, if it facilitates the exchanges of gene sequence data about pathogens and if it permits benefits sharing internationally. Such a result is possible, if its implementation builds upon the pandemic influenza preparedness framework Agreement.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
