The p80 and p54 probes hybridized to 23/24 (96%) and 22 24 (92%), respectively, of CP strains examined. In contrast, these same two probes only detected 16 36 (43%) and 5 36 (13%), respectively, of the NCP strains examined. The gp53 probe detected 18 24 (75%) and the gp62 probe detected 19 24 (79%) of the CP strains. In contrast, these latter two probes only detected 9 37 (24%) and 7 37 (20%), respectively, of NCP strains. This low detecteion rate of NCP strains suggests a need for developing a probe based on NCP sequences for identification of NCP strains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
