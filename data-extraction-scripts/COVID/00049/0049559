In a serious crisis, all affected people take in information differently, process information differently and act on information differently. This chapter incorporates the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) best advice for communicating during a public health crisis, including infectious disease outbreaks, bioterrorism, chemical emergencies, natural disasters, nuclear accidents and radiation releases and explosions. This chapter also explores the growing role of social media that is now being used for a variety of traditional and new purposes from distress calls to disease surveillance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
