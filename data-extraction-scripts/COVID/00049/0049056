<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>15 Nanodiamond Designing the Bio-Platform</TITLE><BODY>Publisher Summary This chapter discusses various methods of surface modification for the development of functionalized diamond nanoparticles for biomedical applications. To be used in biomedical applications, nanoparticles must be biocompatible, non-toxic, non-detective by immune systems, and should not induce side effects. Size control of particles is a prerequisite for biomedical applications. Carbon nanostructures span the same length scale as bio-compounds, ranging from subnanometer-size nucleotides to tens and hundreds of nanometer-sized organelles and viruses, and up to micron-sized cell sizes. The chapter also summarizes different approaches to the surface functionalization of nanodiamonds (ND) particles—that is, the key in successful biomedical applications followed by a discussion of modification of diamond surfaces with nucleic acids and proteins. Both current and potential applications of diamond films and particles in the area of biosensing are addressed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
