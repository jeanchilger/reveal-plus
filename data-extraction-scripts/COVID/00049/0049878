The properties and behavior of these vectors in heterologous situations are also discussed. Ideally, vectors for gene transfer into human cells should be capable of transgene expression without replication or detrimental expression of viral genes. Infection of human cell lines with intact xenogenic adenoviruses established the principle that these viruses are replication defective at the inputs tested, although the molecular basis for defective replication is not understood. Most work with xenogenic vectors is still firmly based in the laboratory and while this is appropriate to demonstrate the utility of a vector the amount of work required for eventual exploitation of a vector in the clinic should not be underestimated. Understanding the biology of these vectors will ultimately lead to an increased choice of gene delivery vectors, providing more options in therapeutic strategy and design.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
