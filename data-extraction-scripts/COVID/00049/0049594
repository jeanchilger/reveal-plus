<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-06-10</DATELINE><TITLE>A multivalent HIV-1 fusion inhibitor based on small helical foldamers</TITLE><BODY>The peptide sequence AcNH–TEG–Glu-Aib-Trp-AibAib-Trp-AibAib-Ile-Asp–OH (1), designed to display the WWI epitope found near the C-terminus of gp41, an envelope glycoprotein decorating the surface of the HIV-1 virus, has been synthesized and proved to have a relevant content of helical conformation because of the presence of five α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) units. Three copies of it have been connected to a tripodal platform based on 2,4,6-triethylbenzene-1,3,5-trimethylamine. The tripodal template 2 is even more structured than 1 thus suggesting a significant interaction between the three sequences connected to the platform. Preliminary inhibition assays of HIV-mediated cell fusion indicated that while the single peptide 1 is inactive within the concentration range of our assay, when it is conjugated to the tripodal platform, it is moderately active. These promising results suggest that our approach constitute a valid alternative to those reported so far.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
