The developed model was validated by experimentation and by published empirical data. Three stages are identified with respect to time for the variation of the IPE: a first stage dominated by the propagation and decay of the exhaled jet, a particles' redistribution stage, and a particles' removal stage. The inhaled dose is affected by the DV flow rate, cough velocity, particle diameter and distance between the occupants. The DV system with a flow rate of 100 L/s reduced significantly the inhaled dose during particle redistribution and removal stages decreasing the total inhaled dose by 83% compared to a flow rate of 50 L/s. IPE is higher when particle diameter is increased from 1 to 20 μm due to the opposition of particle removal by the upward DV. A comparison between steady and transient modeling of the IPE showed that steady modeling captures the physics affecting particle spread due to HMRA but it over-predicts the inhaled dose. It is found that for a DV flow rate of 100 L/s and a cough velocity of 22 m/s during 1 s, and 1 μm particles, the minimum required distance between the occupants for a threshold inhaled dose of 10−5 kg is nearly 0.5 m by transient modeling while it is 2.15 m by steady state modeling.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
