METHODS: We conducted a prospective study between May 2004 and June 2005. Patients with acute pharyngo-tonsillitis were evaluated for causative pathogens and were assessed clinical symptoms and pharyngo-tonsillar finding by a clinical scoring system. RESULTS: A total 214 adult patients were enrolled in this study. Streptococcus pyogenes were identified at 13.6%. Thirty-one viruses were also identified by PCR. They were adenovirus (4.8%), influenza virus (1.0%), RS virus (6.3%), and human metapneumovirus (2.9%). Numbers of total white blood cells and levels of C-reactive protein showed a significant positive correlation with clinical scores (p < 0.001) and were also higher in cases with S. pyogenes. The clinical scores rapidly improved after the antimicrobial treatments in moderate cases and severe cases. CONCLUSION: The current study strongly suggested that the clinical scoring system reflected disease severity well and would be very useful for evaluating clinical course and decision making for the antimicrobial treatment of acute pharyngo-tonisllitis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
