In this study we have constructed a series of full length or truncated mutants of the G2 glycoprotein of Punta Toro virus (PTV), a member of the Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae, and investigated their transport properties. The results indicate that the hydrophobic domain preceding the G2 glycoprotein can function as a translocational signal peptide, and that the hydrophobic domain near the C-terminus serves as a membrane anchor. A G2 glycoprotein construct with an extra hydrophobic sequence derived from the N-terminal NSM region was stably retained in the ER, and was unable to be transported to the Golgi complex. The full-length G2 glycoprotein, when expressed on its own, was transported out of the ER and expressed on the cell surface, whereas the G1 and G2 proteins when expressed together are retained in the Golgi complex. A truncated anchor-minus form of the G2 glycoprotein was found to be secreted into the culture medium, but was retained in the Golgi complex when coexpressed with the G1 glycoprotein. These results indicate that the G2 membrane glycoprotein is a class I membrane protein which does not contain a signal sufficient for Golgi retention, and suggest that its Golgi localization is a result of association with the G1 glycoprotein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
