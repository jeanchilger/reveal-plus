However, some serious criticisms have been raised in the field of strategic management against the employment of such a formal and systematic approach to ES. These opposing views have rarely been discussed in the hospitality management literature. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to bring these views to the fore in the process of reviewing previous research into ES, and to discuss the major challenges involved for hospitality organizations in employing such a formal approach to ES. The discussion throughout this paper reveals that ES is essential for every organization; however, it is even more complex and difficult to accomplish than portrayed in most previous studies in the hospitality management field. The paper identifies and discusses major challenges and problems in employing a form ES approach in hospitality organizations. It also provides recommendations about how ES activities can best be carried out in complex and dynamic environments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
