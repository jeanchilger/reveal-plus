Fifteen air samples were collected with All Glass Impinger-30 (AGI-30) air samplers in each house. Airborne ND viruses were also isolated and virulence identified by in vivo tests. Avirulent viruses were detected both in air samples and swab samples in four houses by degenerate primers based RT-PCR. Virulent viruses were detected only in the air samples by degenerate primers based RT-PCR in two houses. Seven strains viruses were isolated from the RT-PCR positive air samples. Of the seven strains, three strains were virulent viruses and four strains were avirulent viruses identified by in vivo tests. The results showed that it was feasible to detect and differentiate NDV in the air samples using degenerate primers based RT-PCR. This technique could decrease the time it required identify NDV infected flocks while distinguishing between virulent and avirulent viruses. It will help effectively to control Newcastle disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
