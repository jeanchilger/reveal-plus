The nucleus itself is divided into a number of different sub-domains including structures such as the nucleolus. Many of the nuclear proteins that localise to these domains are involved in RNA processing, and because of their limited coding capacity, it may be necessary for RNA viruses to sequester such cellular factors in order to facilitate the replication, transcription and translation of their genomes. Amongst the best-studied examples of this are the picornaviruses, whose infection results in the redistribution of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm and their interaction with the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to facilitate translation of the picornavirus polyprotein. Examples can be found of other positive and also negative strand RNA virus proteins that localise to the nucleus and sub-domains (especially the nucleolus) during virus infection, and several localisation motifs have been defined. Apart from sequestering nuclear proteins for a role in replication, such viruses may also target the nucleus to disrupt nuclear functions and to inhibit antiviral responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
