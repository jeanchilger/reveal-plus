<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Influence of Dietary Fat and Protein on Body Composition of Jersey Bull Calves 1</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Thirty-nine bull calves between 6 and 9 d of age, were assigned to either baseline slaughter or 1 of 4 diets to determine the influence of dietary fat and protein content, at 2 levels of intake, on growth and body composition changes. Calves were assigned to the following diets a 28.5% protein and 16.4% fat milk replacer [MR; 29/16 (n=9)], 27.3% protein and 33.4% fat MR [27/33 (n=8)], 20.6% protein and 20.6% fat MR [20/20 (8)], or whole milk [WM (n=8)]. Calves fed 27/33, 29/16, and WM received 180 g/d of CP to support 650g of ADG based on predictions from the 2001 NRC. Calves were fed 3 times daily for 4 wk. Weight, hip height, wither height, heart girth, and body length were measured weekly. Weekly plasma samples were analyzed for plasma urea nitrogen, nonesterified fatty acids, and glucose. A subset of calves from each treatment was killed [29/16 (n=7), 27/33 (n=6), 20/20 (n=6), and WM (n=5)] at the end of wk 4 of treatment; processed for whole-body analysis of fat, protein, ash, and DM; and compared with baseline slaughter calves to estimate composition of empty BW gain. Calves did not differ in average weekly scour score or medication days. Feed efficiency and ADG were greatest for calves fed WM and least for calves fed 20/20; calves fed 29/16 and 27/33 did not differ. Calves fed 27/33 or WM had the greatest % body fat and gained more grams of fat than calves fed other diets. Calves fed 29/16 or 20/20 had similar % fat in empty body as baseline. Differences in % CP, % ash, or % water in empty body and empty BW gain were not detected. Calves fed 27/33 had a trend toward higher NEFA in wk 1 and 2 than calves fed 29/16 or WM. Growth of calves fed 27/33 and 29/16 were similar except that calves fed 29/16 had lower body fat % than calves fed 27/33. Calves on all diets gained less than predicted by the 2001 NRC.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
