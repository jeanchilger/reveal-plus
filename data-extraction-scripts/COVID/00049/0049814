VARI includes tracheobronchitis (VAT) or pneumonia (VAP). VAT and VAP caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens are increasing in the United States and Europe. In patients with risk factors for MDR pathogens, empiric antibiotics are often initiated for 48 to 72 hours pending the availability of pathogen identification and antibiotic sensitivity data. Extensive data indicate that early, appropriate antibiotic therapy improves outcomes for patients with VAP. Recognizing and treating VARI may allow earlier appropriate therapy and improved patient outcomes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
