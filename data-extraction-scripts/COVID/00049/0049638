However, their relative ability to identify either atypical bacteria or viruses that cause LRTI from clinical samples from various sources is yet to be determined. Objectives and study design The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic yield of nasopharyngeal aspirates with that of pulmonary samples for the etiological diagnosis of severe acute lower respiratory tract infections by multiplex PCR. Patients were adults with community-acquired pneumonia or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Results We obtained concordant results for 81 (79%) of the 103 pairs of samples. In 14 of the 22 discordant results, more pathogens were evidenced in the lower respiratory tract samples. Conclusions Pulmonary samples had a similar diagnostic sensitivity for virus detection by multiplex PCR as nasopharyngeal aspirates. In contrast, in our study, the diagnostic efficacy of pulmonary samples for Legionella pneumophila over simple aspirates was clearly superior.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
