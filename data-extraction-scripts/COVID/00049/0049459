In this study we took a transcriptomic approach to gain insight into the response to viral infection of two strains of the Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) that differ in their resistance to Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV). Changes in gene expression in the hepatopancreas following infection with TSV and Yellow Head Virus (YHV) were assessed using a cDNA microarray containing 2469 putative unigenes. The null hypothesis tested was that significant differences between the transcriptomic responses to viral infection of resistant and sensitive strains would not be detected. This hypothesis was broadly rejected, with the most surprising observation being that the baseline (control, unchallenged) sensitive and resistant strains expressed distinguishable transcriptomic signatures. The resistant line was pre-disposed to lower expression of genes encoding viral (and host) proteins. Many of the genes differentiating resistant and sensitive lines are involved in protein metabolism, cellular trafficking, immune defense and stress response, although it was not possible to clearly identify candidate genes responsible for TSV resistance. In contrast to TSV challenge, YSV either failed to perturb the host transcriptome or created a “confused” response that was difficult to interpret.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
