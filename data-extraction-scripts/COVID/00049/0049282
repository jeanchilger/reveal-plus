One of the influential measures adopted by governments is the establishment of cross-agency networks. Scholars have validated the importance of cross-agency collaboration and networks, but only a few studies have examined cross-agency information sharing and utilization mechanism of joint emergency actions. Inspired by the theory of network embeddedness, we study the joint effects of informational and task attributes of embeddedness and absorptive capacity of the leading agency on collaborative emergency capacity. Our data consist of 110 local government contingency plans collected from F District in Shanghai, China. We found that a well-structured cross-agency network and a leading department with great information accessibility will significantly affect the efficiency of emergency collaborations. The capacity to absorb information significantly enhances the improvement of emergency collaboration.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
