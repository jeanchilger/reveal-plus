Electron microscopy, enzymo-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and counter electrophoresis were employed. This survey allowed to the detection by electron microscopy of Rotavirus (40 cases), Coronaviruses (3 cases), Astroviruses (2 cases), Adenoviruses (2 cases) and Small Round Viruses (1 case). Serological tests (complement fixation, ELISA and counter electrophoresis) done with 86 sera showed a good correlation with results obtained with electron microscopy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
