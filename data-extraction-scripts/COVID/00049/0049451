Two ORFs were found, encoding polypeptides of 11 K (ORF-1) and 22K (ORF-2). The FIPV sequence was compared to the 3′ end sequence of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). ORF-1 has a homologous counterpart (ORF-X3) in the TGEV genome; both ORFs are located at the same position relative to the nucleocapsid gene. However, as a result of an in-frame insertion or deletion, ORF-1 is 69 nucleotides larger than ORF-X3. A similar event has occurred immediately downstream of ORF1: a 624-nucleotide segment, containing the complete ORF-2, is absent in the TGEV sequence. Most sequence similarity (98.5%) was found in the 3′ noncoding sequences. ORF-X3 and ORF-1 are preceded by the sequence AAC-TAAAC, which is assumed to be the transcription-initiation signal in FIPV and TGEV (P. A. Kapke and D. A. Brian (1986) Virology 151, 41–49). By S1 nuclease analysis, the 5′ end of FIPV RNA 6 was mapped immediately upstream of this sequence. A 700-nucleotide TGEV-specific RNA was found by cross-hybridization with an FIPV 3′ end probe, suggesting that TGEV ORF-X3 is also carried on a separate mRNA. The differences at the 3′ ends of the FIPV and TGEV genomes maybe the result of RNA recombination events.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
