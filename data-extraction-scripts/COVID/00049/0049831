In this study, we found out that Coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3) replicon RNA could be encapsidated with CV-B5 capsid to assemble infectious CV-B5 pseudovirus. We then utilized this single round infection system of CV-B5 to develop a neutralizing antibody quantification assay. This pseudovirus neutralization assay showed superiority in biosafety, sensibility, quantitativity, efficiency and high throughput, and would facilitate the epidemiological studies and vaccine development of CV-B5.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
