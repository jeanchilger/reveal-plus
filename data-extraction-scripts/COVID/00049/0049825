These two viral glycoproteins were easily detected on the plasma membrane of 0.1 % paraformaldehyde-fixed swine testis (ST) or pig kidney (RP.D) cells which were infected with high-passaged Purdue-115 and low-passaged D-52 strains and a high-passaged attenuated (188-SG) mutant of TGEV. No significant differences were found between attenuated and virulent strains with regard to the viral antigen expression on the membrane of infected cells over a 14-h period.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
