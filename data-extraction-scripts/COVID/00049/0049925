Numerous alkaloids have been isolated from Narcissus speciesasaresult of the continuing search for novel alkaloids with pharmacological activity in the Amaryllidaceae family. The alkaloids isolated from this genus, classified in relation to the different skeleton types. The different Narcissus wild species and intersectional hybrids, grouped into subgenera and sections, with their corresponding alkaloids, arranged according to their ring system are listed. The biosynthetic pathways of Narcissus alkaloids includes: (1) enzymatic preparation of the precursors, (2) primary cyclization mechanisms, (3) enzymatic preparation of intermediates, (4) secondary cyclization, diversification, and restructuring. The chapter discusses proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C NMR), and mass spectrometry (MS) for Narcissus alkaloids. A list of the different Narcissus alkaloids, their spectroscopic properties, and literature with the most recent spectroscopic data is given. Several Narcissus extracts shows the following activities: antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
