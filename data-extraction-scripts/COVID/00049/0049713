Although human leukocytes could be isolated from the spleen of mock-infected mice during the 2-weeks experiment, the proportion of engrafted human leukocytes in mice infected with MV (103–105 pfu) or rMV-E1E2 (104 pfu) was decreased. Viral infection of the splenocytes was confirmed by the development of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in co-cultures of splenocytes and B95a cells and verified using RT-PCR. Finally, human antibodies against MV were more frequently observed than E2-specific antibodies in serum from mice infected with a low dose of virus (MV, 100–101 pfu, and rMV-E1E2, 101–102 pfu). These results showed the possibility of hu-PBL-NOJ mice for the evaluation of the immunogenicity of viral proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
