The purpose of present study is to investigate the wind induced air pollutant transmission and cross contamination routes in typical buildings. In this paper, a series of experiments was carried out in a boundary layer wind tunnel using a 1:30 scaled model that represented the typical configuration of rectangular multi-storey residential buildings in Shanghai. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was employed as tracer gas in the wind tunnel tests. The conditions under two ventilation modes, i.e. single-sided natural ventilation and cross natural ventilation, were compared. The tracer gas concentration distributions under four approaching wind angles were monitored and analyzed. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method was adopted to assist in analyzing airflow patterns. The experiment results elucidated that in the two ventilation scenarios, both of the vertical and horizontal inter-flat airborne transmission could proceed. The wind direction played a key role on the pollutant concentration distribution. Compared with the single-sided ventilation mode, cross ventilation could weaken the air pollutant dispersion along the vertical direction when the contamination source was on the windward or on the leeward unit. When the wind blowing parallelly to the source unit window, namely the source room was on the sideward, cross ventilation would not suppress the vertical transport on one hand, but reinforce the horizontal transmission on the other hand. The study is helpful for the analysis of infection risk of respiratory diseases in the residential buildings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
