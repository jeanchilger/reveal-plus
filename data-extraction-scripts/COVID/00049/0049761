Methods A national sample of 427 Taiwanese male adults aged at least 45 years (mean (M)=57) were recruited to complete a telephone-based survey questionnaire between April 30 and May 8, 2008. Results The questionnaire results showed that respondents considered themselves less likely than others to get prostate cancer. The relationship between optimistic bias and intention to undergo prostate cancer screening was non-significant, while information seeking positively and significantly predicted such an intention. Conclusions The findings of this study imply that health educators should include risk-awareness strategies and information seeking interventions in the design of cancer prevention programs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
