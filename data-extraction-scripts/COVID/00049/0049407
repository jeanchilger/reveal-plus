It has been reported that up to 55% and 33% of these cases remain without a known cause, respectively, in canine and feline pregnancies. Unusual abortigenic and potentially zoonotic agents, including Coxiella burnetii and Leptospira spp., may be involved in these cases. C. burnetii is able to cause reproductive disorders in cattle, sheep and goats, and cases of abortion have been observed in dogs and cats. Moreover, several outbreaks of C. burnetii infection in humans have been caused by delivering bitches and queens, and some of these animals experienced abortion. Leptospira interrogans sensu lato is able to cause abortion or stillbirth in several animal species and its abortigenic role has occasionally been described in bitches and queens. The aim of this study was to search for C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. DNA in a retrospective series of 103 cases of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality submitted for the identification of possible infectious agents. One hundred and fifty-one specimens were tested using PCR assays and found negative for C. burnetii and Leptospira DNA. However, in 49 samples (47.6%) other infectious causes of abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality were identified. These results showed that C. burnetii and Leptospira spp. are probably not common abortigenic agents or causes of neonatal deaths in dogs. However, given the potential abortigentic and zoonotic role of these agents, surveillance of canine and feline abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality could be advisable for a systematic investigation of these events.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
