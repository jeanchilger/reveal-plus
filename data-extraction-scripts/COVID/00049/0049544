Among them, DNA sensors, with oligonucleotides as recognition elements, are being widely utilized for many applications, mainly diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this experiment, a hybridization-based genosensor was designed on a 100-nm sputtered gold film. This material worked as an immobilization and transduction surface for the electrochemical diagnosis of a specific DNA sequence of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus. The simplicity of the electrochemical instrumentation is combined with a selective methodology to detect the hybridization event enzymatically. This chapter explains all the necessary steps for the construction of the genosensor allowing a low detection limit for the chosen DNA sequence. Protocols for studying the influence of parameters affecting the methodology are given. This chapter also includes questions for students and indications for writing a lab report.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
