<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-10-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Procyonidae, Viverridae, Hyenidae, Herpestidae, Eupleridae, and Prionodontidae</TITLE><BODY>This chapter covers the diseases and pathology of multiple taxonomic groups within the order Carnivora including Procyonidae several of the Feliformia carnivores. The overwhelming majority of knowledge about disease pathogenesis for these species is biased toward raccoons and concern for disease spread to humans and companion animals. Procyonids and feliform carnivores are ubiquitous in their environments and share habitat and environmental resources with other nondomestic and domestic carnivores and humans. As reservoirs for a number of important multispecies or zoonotic pathogens, surveys for pathogens that may be harbored or vectored by several of the species in this chapter, for example, raccoons (e.g., canine distemper virus, rabies, and leptospirosis) and civets (e.g., SARS coronavirus), have been active areas of investigation. Unfortunately, less research has focused on the potential effects of these pathogens on their hosts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
