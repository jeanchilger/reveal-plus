The rTTV-E1E2 boosted the immune response to HCV DNA vaccine prime significantly, and the inverted terminal repeat sequence harboring DNA construct PAAV-CE1E2 was the best prime agent in this study. Our study provides new information for both the prime–boost regimen and long-term T-cell response for HCV vaccine development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
