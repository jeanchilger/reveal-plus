Based on the chemical structure of a lead compound from a previous screening, we have designed and synthesized a number of non-peptidyl inhibitors, some of which have shown significantly improved inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV Mpro with IC50 values of ∼60nM. In the absence of SARS-CoV Mpro crystal structures in complex with these synthetic inhibitors, molecular docking tools have been employed to study possible interactions between these inhibitors and SARS-CoV Mpro. The docking results suggest two major modes for the initial binding of these inhibitors to the active site of SARS-CoV Mpro. They also establish a structural basis for the ‘core design’ of these inhibitors by showing that the 3-chloropyridine functions common to all of the present inhibitors tend to cluster in the S1 specificity pocket. In addition, intrinsic flexibility in the S4 pocket allows for the accommodation of bulky groups such as benzene rings, suggesting that this structural plasticity can be further exploited for optimizing inhibitor–enzyme interactions that should promote a tighter binding mode. Most importantly, our results provide the structural basis for rational design of wide-spectrum antiviral drugs targeting the chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinases from coronaviruses and picornaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
