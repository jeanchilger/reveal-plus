As reported in this study, using high throughput screening against ∼6800 small molecules, we have identified several novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) with IC(50) of low μM. Interestingly, one of them equally inhibited both 3C(pro) and 3CL(pro) from PV and CoV, respectively. Using computer modeling, the structural features of these compounds as individual and common protease inhibitors were elucidated to enhance our knowledge for developing anti-viral agents against PV and CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
