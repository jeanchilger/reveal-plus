<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1986-05-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Porcine coccidia in Papua New Guinea</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Faecal samples from 232 domestic pigs raised on concrete, 98 free-ranging village pigs, and five wild boar showed 46.6 ( 108 232 ), 54 ( 53 98 ) and 80% ( 4 5 ) prevalence of coccidian oocysts, respectively. Eight species of Eimeria, and Isospora suis, were recovered. In their descending order of predominance in the pigs raised on concrete, the species of coccidia were E. debliecki (26.7%), E. scabra (22.4%), E. neodebliecki (19.8%), E. porci (15.5%), E. suis (11.6%), E. polita (8.6%), E. perminuta (7%), E. spinosa (5.6%) and E. suis (3.9%). The first five species listed above predominated in the village pigs as well. E. polita, E. spinosa and I. suis were not found in the wild boar. I. suis oocysts prevailed in 8.3% of the 36 sows on concrete, and in 11.1% ( 3 27 ) of those which were positive for coccidia. Isosporoid oocysts were absent in the village sows. Of the 125 <24-day-old piglets, 29.6% were diarrhoeic, and of these, 43.2% were positive for coccidia. Four of the 16 (25%) coccidia-positive, diarrhoeic piglets, and four of the 37 (10.8%) coccidia-positive non-diarrhoeic piglets shed I. suis oocysts, an observation which seems to weaken the present contention that I. suis is the primary causative agent of neonatal porcine occidiosis. The highest mean number of oocysts per gram faeces (23 550) was recorded from the diarrhoeic farm piglets on conrete, and the lowest of 6,100 from the gestating farm sows. Mean opg data revealed very little significant quantitative variation between the corresponding age groups of the free-ranging village pigs and the commercially-farmed ones. One of the most interesting findings in the study was that the sows were more frequently infected than all other age groups.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
