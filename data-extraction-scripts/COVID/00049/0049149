Of 139 episodes of wheezing, 58 (42 per cent) were associated with identifiable viral infections. There were 25 respiratory syncytial virus infections; wheezing occurred in 24 of these and pneumonia in 13. Parainfluenza type 2 infection appeared to be next most likely to be associated with wheezing, followed by coronavirus infection. Influenza A. (Hong Kong) was not associated with wheezing in any of the children. Infection with “pathogenic” bacteria was not statistically associated with wheezing.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
