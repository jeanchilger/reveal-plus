Existing graphical representation methods have achieved promising results in sequence comparison, but there are some design challenges with the graphical representations and feature-based measures. We reported here a new method for sequence comparison. It considers whole distribution of dual bases and employs polar coordinates method to map a biological sequence into a closed curve. The curve tree was then constructed to numerically characterize the closed curve of biological sequences, and further compared biological sequences by evaluating the distance of the curve tree of the query sequence matching against a corresponding curve tree of the template sequence. The proposed method was tested by phylogenetic analysis, and its performance was further compared with alignment-based methods. The results demonstrate that using polar coordinates representation and curve tree to compare sequences is more efficient.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
