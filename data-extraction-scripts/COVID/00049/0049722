Given the essential role of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in regulating a myriad of cellular processes, it is not surprising that malfunction of UPS components is implicated in numerous human diseases, including many types of cancer. The clinical success of proteasome inhibitors in treating multiple myeloma has further stimulated enthusiasm for targeting UPS proteins for pharmacological intervention in cancer treatment, particularly in the precision medicine era. Unfortunately, despite tremendous efforts, the paucity of potent and selective UPS inhibitors has severely hampered attempts to exploit the UPS for therapeutic benefits. To tackle this problem, many groups have been working on technology advancement to rapidly and effectively screen for potent and specific UPS modulators as intracellular probes or early-phase therapeutic agents. Here, we review several emerging technologies for developing chemical- and protein-based molecules to manipulate UPS enzymatic activity, with the aim of providing an overview of strategies available to target ubiquitination for cancer therapy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
