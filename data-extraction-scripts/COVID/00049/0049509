Progress in targeted therapeutics requires establishing effective approaches for high-throughput identification of agents specific for clinically relevant cell surface markers. Over the past decade, a number of platform strategies have been developed to screen polypeptide libraries for ligands targeting receptors selectively expressed in the context of various cell surface proteomes. Streamlined procedures for identification of ligand-receptor pairs that could serve as targets in disease diagnosis, profiling, imaging and therapy have relied on the display technologies, in which polypeptides with desired binding profiles can be serially selected, in a process called biopanning, based on their physical linkage with the encoding nucleic acid. These technologies include virus/phage display, cell display, ribosomal display, mRNA display and covalent DNA display (CDT), with phage display being by far the most utilized. The scope of this review is the recent advancements in the display technologies with a particular emphasis on molecular mapping of cell surface proteomes with peptide phage display. Prospective applications of targeted compounds derived from display libraries in the discovery of targeted drugs and gene therapy vectors are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
