In this chapter we explore some of these factors and provide an overview of disseminated infections examining some important manifestations such as toxic shock syndrome and sepsis as well as examining some of molecular aspects including host receptors and bacterial antigens. A brief discussion will also follow about disseminated infections in specific populations such as neonates and the immunosuppressed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
