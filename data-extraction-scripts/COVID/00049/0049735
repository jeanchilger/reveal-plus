TaqMan–PCR was optimized to quantify BVD virus using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system and dual-labeled fluorogenic probes. Two different gene specific labeled fluorogenic probes for the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) were used to differentiate between BVD types I and II. Sensitivity of the single tube TaqMan assay was compared with two-tube TaqMan assay and standard RT–PCR using 10-fold dilutions of RNA. Single tube TaqMan assay was 10–100-fold more sensitive than the two-tube TaqMan assay and the standardized single tube RT–PCR. Specificity of the assay was evaluated by testing different BVD virus strains and other bovine viruses. A total of 106 BVD positive and negative pooled or single serum samples, field isolates and reference strains were tested. Quantitation of cRNA from types I and II BVD virus was accomplished by a standard curve plotting cycle threshold values (C T) versus copy number. Single tube TaqMan–PCR assay was sensitive, specific and rapid for detection, quantitation and classification of BVD virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
