<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>The CD200–CD200R1 Inhibitory Signaling Pathway: Immune Regulation and Host–Pathogen Interactions</TITLE><BODY>The CD200:CD200R1 inhibitory signaling pathway has been implicated in playing a prominent role in limiting inflammation in a wide range of inflammatory diseases. CD200R1 signaling inhibits the expression of proinflammatory molecules including tumor necrosis factor, interferons, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in response to selected stimuli. Unsurprisingly, due to the regulatory role that CD200R1 plays in multiple inflammatory pathways, an increasing number of parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens exploit this pathway to suppress host defenses. A complete understanding of the pathways regulated by CD200R1 signaling and the diverse mechanisms that pathogens have evolved to manipulate the CD200:CD200R1 pathway can help identify clinical situations where targeting this interaction can be of therapeutic benefit. In this review, we compare CD200R1 to other pathogen-targeted inhibitory receptors and highlight how this signaling pathway is utilized by a diverse number of pathogens and, therefore, may represent a novel targeting strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
