The IgG index as indicator for intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis was normal in animals with non-inflammatory demyelinating lesions and elevated in dogs with inflammatory myelin lesions. Specific antibodies against CDV and myelin were quantitated in CSF and serum from 8 dogs with an elevated IgG index. Eight of these dogs had significant amounts of antimyelin antibody and 4 dogs had neutralizing anti-CDV antibody in the CSF. Whereas the pathogenetic significance of antimyelin antibodies remains uncertain, the intrathecal antiviral immune response provides a plausible explanation for immunopathologic destruction of myelin in distemper.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
