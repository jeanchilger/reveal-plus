This condition does not involve the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result of an antigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection or a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting the CNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) impermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As a result of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and inflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination. Several mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB. The role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in initiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains extremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions regarding the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or its forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading to bystander demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to the CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as a trigger or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical, neuropathological and experimental evidence. Along with another viral infection, it must be one of the commonest causes of progression of MS, and quite often leads to the onset of the clinical manifestations of an hitherto asymptomatic condition.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
