<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1992-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Equine arteritis virus: An overview</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The causative agent of the respiratory disease equine viral arteritis is a small, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome organization and replication strategy related to that of coronaviruses and toroviruses. Clinical signs of infection in horses vary widely and severe infection can lead to pregnant mares aborting. Infected horses generally make good recoveries but stallions may become semen shedders of equine arteritis virus (EAV). These carrier stallions play an important role in the dissemination and perpetuation of EAV. Laboratory tests exist to detect virus and the equine immune response to infection. However, vaccines are not currently licensed in the UK to combat viral arteritis, the incidence of which may increase due to changes in European legislation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
