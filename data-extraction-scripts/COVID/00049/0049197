<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Respiratory Infections</TITLE><BODY>Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a common health problem of international travelers. Travelers may be at increased risk of RTIs due to travel itself (mingling and close quarters in airports, airplanes, cruise ships, and hotels), and due to unique exposure at travel destinations. The clinical spectrum of RTIs in travelers is broad and includes upper RTIs, pharyngitis, otitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Most travelers who acquire an RTI only develop mild disease, and only a minority seek medical attention. All travelers should be up to date on any indicated vaccines based on age and medical condition that prevent RTIs, including influenza, measles, pneumococcal diseases, Haemophilus influenzae b, Neisseria meningitidis, diphtheria, and pertussis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
