The rules for writing in life science are consistent with those in earth and environmental sciences and medical science. As with all scientific writing, it is important to research the specific needs and preferences of the journal to which the manuscript is being sent. This will not only ease the writing process, but will also increase the chances of publication. This chapter explains biochemical nomenclature and abbreviations used in life science. In addition, it includes a list of preferred units in the life sciences. In scientific writing, especially in the United States, articles dealing with life science issues are appearing much less frequently than those in other scientific disciplines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
