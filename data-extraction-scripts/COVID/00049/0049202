It has been shown that AKAV induces apoptosis in mammalian cells. It is necessary to understand the signaling pathways involved in AKAV-induced apoptosis to further elucidate the molecular virology of AKAV. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are mediators of apoptosis; therefore, we investigated the roles of JNK and p38 MAPK cascades in AKAV-infected cells. We found that JNK and p38 MAPK as well as their downstream substrates, c-Jun and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), were phosphorylated in response to AKAV infection. A JNK inhibitor (SP600125) inhibited AKAV-mediated apoptosis whereas a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) did not. We conclude that AKAV infection activates the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, and the JNK cascade plays a crucial role in AKAV-induced apoptosis in vitro.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
