Interactions between NC and these proteins were estimated by Stern–Volmer and van't Hoff equations. The binding constants and the thermodynamic parameters, ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG at different temperatures were also determined by using these equations. Data showed that NC may exhibit a static quenching mechanism with all proteins. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated. Data showed that van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds are the main forces for human serum albumin and hemoglobin. Globulin, however, bound to NC via hydrophobic interaction. The spectral changes of synchronous fluorescence suggested that both the microenvironment of NC and the conformation of the proteins changed in relation to their concentrations during NC's binding.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
