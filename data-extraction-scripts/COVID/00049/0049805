Severity of the pandemic was not part of the definition used, but it was stated to be less than severe at the time of declaration. It was necessary, when there was still uncertainty about the overall impact of the pandemic, for vaccine production to begin to have timely availability. Countries arranged to have vaccine for their populations, and WHO attempted to secure supplies for under-resourced countries. The world had been concerned that the next pandemic might be a severe one, based on the specter of avian influenza with a case fatality of up to 80% in humans. After it was clear that the 2009 pandemic was not severe, there were accusations, especially in Europe, that countries had secured vaccine supplies mainly to benefit the manufacturers. Such charges, even when refuted, may undermine public confidence in the process which assures vaccine supply and availability of vaccine for seasonal use. Production of pandemic vaccine is conditioned on the supply of seasonal influenza vaccine; it is unrealistic to expect vaccine to be available for pandemic use when none is used for seasonal influenza. This particularly applies to poorer counties. They have traditionally not recognized that influenza is a problem, although this attitude is changing. As we go forward, we need to keep in mind the global nature of the threat of influenza. Had the 2009 pandemic been more severe, demand would have been greater and poorer counties would have had little vaccine to meet their needs. Only by taking a broad view of influenza on an annual basis can vaccine supplies be ensured for all countries of the world.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
