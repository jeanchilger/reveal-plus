In this study we present the design and validation of a single tube RT-PCR assay using a pair of consensus primers for the detection of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Sequencing of the amplicons permits the species identification. The assay was validated using RNA from the yellow fever virus vaccine strain and from representative strains of dengue viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4, West Nile virus, Kunjin virus (a clade of West Nile virus), and St. Louis encephalitis virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
