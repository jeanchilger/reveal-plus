<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1999-05-01</DATELINE><TITLE>PEDIATRIC ALLERGY Can It Be Prevented?</TITLE><BODY>The current paradigm of allergy pathogenesis is that allergy develops in individuals with a genetic predisposition only after they are exposed to allergens (Fig. 1). This hypothesis implies that factors in the environment can determine the initiation of allergic sensitization and can potentially influence the clinical manifestations and severity of disease. Because the prevalence of atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy have increased worldwide in the past several decades, and there is no mechanism for changes in population genetics over this short period of time, changes in the human environment are most likely responsible for these trends. From this line of reasoning, it follows that if the factors responsible for the increasing prevalence can be identified, then there would be an opportunity to develop strategies to reverse these trends. It also would be helpful to identify infants who are at risk for developing allergy, so that preventive strategies could be used most effectively. In this article, studies to determine the contributions of genetics and the environment to the development of allergic diseases in childhood are explored. In addition, progress in identifying risk factors for allergy and preventive therapies for those children at risk are also addressed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
