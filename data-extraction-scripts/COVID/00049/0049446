One such isolate, a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, was partially induced for lactose operon expression in tryptone containing media, and was also pathogenic in a rabbit ileal loop model for NEC. A spontaneous segregant of this strain was no longer partially induced for lactose operon expression, and was no longer pathogenic in the rabbit model. The gene responsible for this phenotype was cloned. The resulting plasmid was shown to cause both partially induced lactose operon expression and pathogenicity when introduced into a laboratory K. pneumoniae strain. A K. pneumoniae mutant deficient in lactose repressor synthesis was also pathogenic in the rabbit model. These results and previous studies on the intraluminal biochemistry of infants with NEC support the hypothesis that an increased ability for lactose fermentation may be a bacterial pathogenic trait with respect to NEC.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
