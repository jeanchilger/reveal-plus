Furthermore, culture is poorly suited to the diagnosis of polymicrobial infections. Finally, a syndromic approach should target both bacteria and viruses causing the same syndrome. The detection of specific DNA sequences in clinical specimen, using DNA microarrays, is an alternative. Microarrays were first used as a diagnostic tool in 1993, to identify a hantavirus associated with an outbreak of acute respiratory diseases. The main advantage of microarrays is multiplexing, enabling exploration of the microbiota and pathogen detection in bacteremia, respiratory infections, and digestive infections: circumstance in which DNA arrays may lack sensitivity and provide false negatives. Enrichment of sampling can increase sensitivity. Furthermore, chips allow typing Streptococcus pneumoniae and detecting resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (rifampicin, isoniazid, fluoroquinolones). However, the cost and high technical requirements remain a problem for routine use of this bacterial infection diagnostic technology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
