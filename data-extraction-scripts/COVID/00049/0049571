<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-01-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Synthesis, anti-varicella-zoster virus and anti-cytomegalovirus activity of quinazoline-2,4-diones containing isoxazolidine and phosphonate substructures</TITLE><BODY>Cycloadditions of N-substituted C-(diethoxyphosphoryl)nitrones to N-allylated quinazoline-2,4-diones functionalized at N3 with substituted benzoyl or benzyl groups proceeded with moderate to good diastereoselectivities (d.e. 28–68%). The synthesized isoxazolidine phosphonates were assessed for the antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. Compounds trans-13c, cis-13c/trans-13c (86:14), cis-15b/trans-15b (87:13) and trans-15d/cis-15d (95:5) exhibited the highest activity toward both TK(+) and TK(−) VZV strains (mean EC(50) values in the range of 3.0–8.7 μM). The EC(50)'s for isoxazolidines trans-12a, cis-12a, cis-13a, trans-13d, cis-15a/trans-15a (50:50) ranged between 6.9 and 8.5 μM for VZV TK(+) strain and between 10.7 and 13.2 μM for VZV TK(–) strain. The isoxazolidine phosphonates cis-15/trans-15 having benzyl substituents both at N3 of the quinazoline-2,4-dione skeleton and at N2 of the isoxazolidine ring displayed some anti-cytomegalovirus potency but at the same time showed significant cytostatic activity for human embryonic lung fibroblasts (used to carry out the antiviral assays) as well as for other cell lines (i.e. CEM, L1210, HeLa and HMEC-1).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
