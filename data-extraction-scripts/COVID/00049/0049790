By using complete nucleotide sequences of S1 gene we determined the phylogeny of these IBV isolates, which in turn allowed us to define six lineages/genotypes, a number of recombinants and a novel variant. The GI-19 lineage was the most frequently isolated type in China in recent years. Although scattered mutations in the S1 gene among the GI-19 lineage viruses were observed, we also noted different sublineages in the GI-19 lineage with unique mutations, suggesting a high degree of S1 gene variation since they were first isolated in the mid-1990s. We also isolated a number of vaccine-like viruses from vaccinated diseased chickens, although more work is needed to differentiate the reisolation of vaccine strains from field strains of the same serotype. One of the important findings in this study is that the prevalence of the TW I type viruses in GI-7 lineage has been increasing in recent years in China. Another important finding is that recombination events occurred between the predominant GI-19 lineage and the commonly used 4/91 vaccine, which gave rise to distinct IBV isolates. In addition, a novel IBV isolate, together with a reference strain in GenBank database, were found to form a novel lineage/genotype that was remarkably distinct from established lineages. The characteristics of the antigenicity, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and complete genome were required for further investigation for the recombinants and the viruses in different sublineages and novel lineages. Meanwhile, permanent monitoring of circulating strains was needed to monitor the emerging viruses and rationally modify vaccination strategies in the field situation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
