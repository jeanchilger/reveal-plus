The TFI nucleotide sequence had very high identity to the British virulent field isolate FS772/70 (98.3%), the attenuated Purdue 115 (96.7%) and from the S gene to ORF-4 gene region, to the low passaged virulent Miller (98.3%) strains of TGEV. Comparison of the TFI S protein sequence with those determined from other TGEV strains and those of the TGEV variant, porcine respiratory coronavirus, isolated from Europe and North America showed that they had changed very little over a period of 4 decades. The two extra amino acids found to be present in the spike proteins of the virulent FS772/70 and Miller strains when compared to the avirulent Purdue strain were found to be present in the TFI strain. The genomic organisation of the TFI strain was the same as that of the other TGEV viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
