<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-08-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Rhinoviruses</TITLE><BODY>Rhinovirus is the major cause of common colds in humans. For many years, common colds were considered a trivial disease, but more recent evidence suggests that the many serotypes of rhinovirus are responsible for triggering the development of acute viral otitis media and sinusitis, exacerbation of asthma in children and adults, and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to improved symptomatic treatment of colds, new treatment strategies are needed to reduce the morbidity of rhinovirus infections. Further understanding of the pathogenesis of rhinovirus infection in the ear, sinus, and lower airways is warranted.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
