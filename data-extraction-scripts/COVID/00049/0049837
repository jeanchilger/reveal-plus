In the present study, in vitro Caco-2 cell, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion and in vivo pharmacokinetics study were performed to investigate the effects of COS on the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids. The pharmacological effects such as antiviral activity improvement by COS were verified by MDCK cell damage inhibition rate after influenza virus propagation. The observations from in vitro Caco-2 cell showed that the absorption of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract could be improved by COS. Meanwhile, COS at the same low, medium and high concentrations caused a significant, concentration-dependent increase in the P app-value for phenolic acids compared to the control group (p <0.05), and was all safe for the Caco-2 cells. The observations from single-pass intestinal perfusion in situ model showed that the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids can be enhanced by COS. Meanwhile, the absorption enhancing effect of phenolic acids might be saturable in different intestine sites. In pharmacokinetics study, COS at dosage of 25mg/kg improved the bioavailability of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract to the greatest extent, and was safe for gastrointestine from morphological observation. Besides, treatment with Flos Lonicerae extract with COS at dosage of 25mg/kg prevented MDCK cell damage upon influenza virus propagation better than that of control. All findings above suggested that COS at dosage of 25mg/kg might be safe and effective absorption enhancer for improving the bioavailability of phenolic acids and the antiviral activity in vitro in Flos Lonicerae extract.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
