<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1998-08-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Virus infections of the gastrointestinal tract of poultry</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Several different viruses have been identified as causes of gastrointestinal tract infections in poultry. These include rotaviruses, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and reoviruses. In addition, a number of other viruses of unknown importance have been associated with gastrointestinal diseases in poultry based on electron microscopic examination of feces and intestinal contents. Viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract of poultry are known to negatively impact poultry production, and they likely contribute to the development of other, extragastrointestinal diseases. Our current understanding of the viruses that cause gastrointestinal tract infections in poultry is reviewed, with emphasis given to those of greatest importance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
