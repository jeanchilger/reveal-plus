Available CMV antivirals target the viral DNA polymerase, have significant toxicities, and suffer from resistance. New drugs targeting different pathways would be beneficial. The anthraquinone emodin is proposed to inhibit herpes simplex virus by blocking the viral nuclease. Emodin and related anthraquinones are also reported to inhibit CMV. In the present study, emodin reduced CMV infectious yield with an EC(50) of 4.9 μM but was cytotoxic at concentrations only two-fold higher. Related anthraquinones acid blue 40 and alizarin violet R inhibited CMV at only high concentrations (238–265 μM) that were also cytotoxic. However, atanyl blue PRL inhibited infectious yield of CMV with an EC(50) of 6.3 μM, significantly below its 50% cytotoxic concentration of 216 μM. Atanyl blue PRL reduced CMV infectivity and inhibited spread. When added up to one h after infection, it dramatically reduced CMV immediate early protein expression and blocked viral DNA synthesis. However, it had no antiviral activity when added 24 h after infection. Interestingly, atanyl blue PRL inhibited nuclease activities of purified CMV UL98 protein with IC(50) of 4.5 and 9.3 μM. These results indicate that atanyl blue PRL targets very early post-entry events in CMV replication and suggest it may act through inhibition of UL98, making it a novel CMV inhibitor. This compound may provide valuable insights into molecular events that occur at the earliest times post-infection and serve as a lead structure for antiviral development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
