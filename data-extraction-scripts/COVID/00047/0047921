However, data on RV types and the associations with clinical outcome in young children are limited. Here, we investigated the clinical, virological and epidemiological characteristics of RV infections in young children with mild or asymptomatic infection (non-hospitalised children) and in symptomatic young children admitted to the hospital. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between different characteristics of RV infections and clinical outcome in young children. Study design RV-infected children were retrospectively selected from a Dutch birth cohort (EUROPA-study) and from hospitalised children admitted to the hospital because of respiratory symptoms. In total 120 RV-typed samples could be selected from 65 non-hospitalised and 49 hospitalised children between November 2009 and December 2012. Results RV-A was the predominant species in both study populations, followed closely by RV-C. RV-B was observed only sporadically. The distribution of the RV species was comparable in non-hospitalised and hospitalised children. In children with respiratory distress who required ICU-admission the distribution of RV species did not differ significantly from the non-hospitalised children. No predominant RV type was present in non-hospitalised nor hospitalised children. However, hospitalised children were younger, had more often an underlying illness, a higher RV load and more frequently a bacterial co-infection. Conclusions Clinical outcome of RV infected young children was not related to RV species or types, but may more likely be influenced by multiple (host-specific) factors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
