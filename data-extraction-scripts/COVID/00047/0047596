<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-02-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Polyarteritis Nodosa in a Cat with Involvement of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems</TITLE><BODY>Summary An 18-month-old neutered male domestic shorthair cat was referred with a history of pyrexia, polyuria and polydypsia, and transient episodes of bilateral hindlimb paralysis. Cardiac evaluation revealed severe systemic hypertension and severe concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. One month later the cat had a new episode of hindlimb paralysis with recurrent seizures, and died in status epilepticus. At necropsy examination, the coronary arteries, arcuate renal arteries and common iliac arteries showed marked thickening with nodules segmentally located along the vessels and consequent narrowing of the lumina. Histologically, acute and chronic inflammatory infiltration of the vascular walls was associated with necrosis of the muscular layer. Lesions were consistent with polyarteritis nodosa and involved the small, medium and large arteries of the heart, kidneys, small and large intestine, mesentery, liver and thyroid. Multifocal meningeal vasculitis associated with focal infarction of the frontal lobe and necrotizing vascular polyneuropathy were detected. Involvement of the central and peripheral nervous systems in polyarteritis nodosa is a novel finding in cats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
