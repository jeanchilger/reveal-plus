The experiences of an OIE-Collaborating Centre and of two EU project consortia are summarised on the diagnostic application of gel-based PCR, general PCR systems, phylogeny, molecular epidemiology, real-time PCR (TaqMan, Molecular Beacons, Primer-Probe Energy Transfer), amplification without thermocycling (Invader), multiplex PCR, nucleic acid extraction and pipetting robotics, automation and quality control, including internal controls. By following the steps of OIE validation, the diagnostic assays are nationally and internationally standardised. The development of padlock probes and microarrays, as well as ultra rapid PCR and sequencing methods is further improving the arsenal of nucleic acid based molecular diagnosis. Further trends of diagnostic development are also mentioned, in order to combat TADs and other viral infections more effectively in the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
