The candidate vaccine elicited strong antigenicity related to the increases of anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes, together with higher levels of lymphocytes, particularly of circulating CD8(+) T-lymphocytes and Leishmania chagasi antigen-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocytes. As indicated by the intense cell proliferation and increased nitric oxide production during in vitro stimulation by L. chagasi soluble antigens, the candidate vaccine elicited an immune activation status potentially compatible with effective control of the etiological agent of CVL.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
