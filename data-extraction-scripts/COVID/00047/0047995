Redox signaling is a critical component of cell signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, metabolism, hormone signaling, immune regulation and variety of other physiological functions. Early studies demonstrated that PRDXs regulates cell growth, metabolism and immune regulation and therefore involved in the pathologic regulator or protectant of several cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory diseases. Oxidative stress and antioxidant systems are important regulators of redox signaling regulated diseases. In addition, thiol-based redox systems through peroxiredoxins have been demonstrated to regulate several redox-dependent process related diseases. In this review article, we will discuss recent findings regarding PRDXs in the development of diseases and further discuss therapeutic approaches targeting PRDXs. Moreover, we will suggest that PRDXs could be targets of several diseases and the therapeutic agents for targeting PRDXs may have potential beneficial effects for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative diseases and inflammatory diseases. Future research should open new avenues for the design of novel therapeutic approaches targeting PRDXs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
