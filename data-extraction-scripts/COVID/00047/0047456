<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-09-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Integrating Disaster Preparedness Into a Community Health Nursing Course: One School's Experience</TITLE><BODY>It is not practical to wait for a disaster, whether natural or human-made, to learn how to respond and provide specialized care. The Long Island University School of Nursing in Brooklyn, New York, has developed a specific educational experience for undergraduate nursing students enrolled in community health. The course is offered in the senior semester and includes didactic material based on the International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education–recommended competencies. Students are given the opportunity to apply the learning and develop additional skills by participating in a mock drill. Although anecdotal comments from the students indicate that the coursework has been helpful, additional research is planned to evaluate the program.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
