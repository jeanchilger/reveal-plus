However, effective means for combating coronaviruses are still lacking. The interaction between nonstructural protein (nsp) 10 and nsp16 has been demonstrated and the crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp16/10 complex has been revealed. As nsp10 acts as an essential trigger to activate the 2′-O-methyltransferase activity of nsp16, short peptides derived from nsp10 may have inhibitory effect on viral 2′-O-methyltransferase activity. In this study, we revealed that the domain of aa 65–107 of nsp10 was sufficient for its interaction with nsp16 and the region of aa 42–120 in nsp10, which is larger than the interaction domain, was needed for stimulating the nsp16 2′-O-methyltransferase activity. We further showed that two short peptides derived from the interaction domain of nsp10 could inhibit the 2′-O-methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV nsp16/10 complex, thus providing a novel strategy and proof-of-principle study for developing peptide inhibitors against SARS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
