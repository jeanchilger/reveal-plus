The isolation and engineering of the corresponding genes is becoming less of a bottleneck in the process; however, the production of recombinant antibodies is itself a limiting factor and a shortage is expected in the coming years. Milk from transgenic animals appears to be one of the most attractive sources of recombinant antibodies. None of the production systems presently implemented (CHO cells, insect cells infected by baculovirus, or transgenic animals and plants) has yet been optimized. This review describes the advantages of using milk for antibody production in comparison with the other systems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
