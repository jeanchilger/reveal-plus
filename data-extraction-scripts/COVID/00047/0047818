<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2000-07-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Foodborne viral illness - status in Australia</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Norwalk-like virus contamination of oysters and orange juice, and hepatitis A virus contamination of oysters have been responsible for large outbreaks of foodborne viral disease in Australia. Rotavirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, parvovirus and other enteroviruses also contribute to the incidence of gastroenteritis in this country but the role of foods and waters in transmitting these viruses is unclear. Protocols for the investigation, surveillance and reporting of foodborne viral illness require further development to enable a more accurate description of the problem. Few laboratories have the capability to analyse foods for viruses and specific training in this technology is needed. Management of food safety in Australia largely relies on the implementation of HACCP principles, but these need to be adapted to address the specific risks from viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
