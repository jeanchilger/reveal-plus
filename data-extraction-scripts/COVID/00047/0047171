<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Infections virales émergentes</TITLE><BODY>SUMMARY Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have again entered the public arena in recent years. This is due to factors such as evolving lifestyles, ecological and socio-political upheavals, and recent diagnostic advances. Numerous pathogens, including viruses like West Nile, Chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis on the one hand, and hemorrhagic fever viruses like Ebola and Maburg, are particular concerns. Recently, the Corona virus responsible for SARS, which caused an epidemic sufficiently worrisome to challenge crisis management concepts, was successfully isolated. It is in this context that so-called “ bird flu’ “ , may be on the verge of causing a human pandemic. Pox and Monkeypox are “ virtually emerging “ viruses that have potential for use in bioterrorism. The management and treatment of these emerging infectious diseases calls for new approaches, organizations and infrastructures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
