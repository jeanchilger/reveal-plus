Methods We compared a single dose of 100 mg/kg of IV magnesium sulfate vs placebo for acute bronchiolitis. Patients received bronchodilator therapy, nebulized hypertonic saline, and 5 days of dexamethasone if there was eczema and/or a family history of asthma. Time to medical readiness for discharge was the primary efficacy outcome. Bronchiolitis severity scores and need for infirmary or hospital admission and for clinic revisits within 2 weeks were secondary outcomes. Cardiorespiratory instability onset was the safety outcome. Results A total of 162 previously healthy infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis aged 22 days to 17.6 months (median, 3.7 months) were enrolled. Approximately one-half of patients had eczema and/or a family history of asthma; 86.4% had positive findings on nasopharyngeal virus swabs. Geometric mean time until medical readiness for discharge was 24.1 h (95% CI, 20.0-29.1) for the 78 magnesium-treated patients and 25.3 h (95% CI, 20.3-31.5) for the 82 patients receiving placebo (ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.52-1.80]; P = .91). Mean bronchiolitis severity scores over time were similar for the two groups. The frequency of clinic visits in the subsequent 2 weeks (33.8% and 27.2%, respectively) was also similar. Fifteen magnesium recipients (19.5%) vs five placebo recipients (6.2%) were readmitted to the infirmary or hospital within 2 weeks (P = .016). No acute cardiorespiratory side effects were reported. Conclusions IV magnesium did not provide benefit for patients with acute bronchiolitis and may be harmful.
