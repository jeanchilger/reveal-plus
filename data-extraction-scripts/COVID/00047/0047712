We aimed to determine the reliability of a combination of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS), Internal Medicine in-Training Examination (IM-ITE®) and OSCE, and to verify the correlation between the small-scale OSCE+DOPS+IM-ITE®-composited scores and 360-degree evaluation scores of first year post-graduate (PGY1) residents. Methods Between 2007 January to 2010 January, two hundred and nine internal medicine PGY1 residents completed DOPS, IM-ITE® and small-scale OSCE at our hospital. Faculty members completed 12-item 360-degree evaluation for each of the PGY1 residents regularly. Results The small-scale OSCE scores correlated well with the 360-degree evaluation scores (r = 0.37, p < 0.021). Interestingly, the addition of DOPS scores to small-scale OSCE scores [small-scale OSCE+DOPS-composited scores] increased it's correlation with 360-degree evaluation scores of PGY1 residents (r = 0.72, p < 0.036). Further, combination of IM-ITE® score with small-scale OSCE+DOPS scores [small-scale OSCE+DOPS+IM-ITE®-composited scores] markedly enhanced their correlation with 360-degree evaluation scores (r = 0.85, p < 0.016). Conclusion The strong correlations between 360-degree evaluation and small-scale OSCE+DOPS+IM-ITE®-composited scores suggested that both methods were measuring the same quality. Our results showed that the small-scale OSCE, when associated with both the DOPS and IM-ITE®, could be an important assessment method for PGY1 residents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
