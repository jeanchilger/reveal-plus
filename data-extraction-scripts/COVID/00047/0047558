Recently we have shown that a set of nine synthetic antimicrobial peptides, four originating from thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins named PD1–PD4 and five synthetic repeats of arginine-tryptophan (RW) repeats (RW1-5) demonstrate antibacterial activity in plasma and platelets. Using WR strain of vaccinia virus (VV) as a model virus for enveloped virus in the present study, we tested the same nine synthetic peptides for their antiviral activity. A cell culture-based standard plaque reduction assay was utilized to estimate antiviral effectiveness of the peptides. Our analysis revealed that peptides PD3, PD4, and RW3 were virucidal against VV with PD3 demonstrating the highest antiviral activity of 100-fold reduction in viral titers, whereas, PD4 and RW3 peptide treatments resulted in 10–30-fold reduction. The EC50 values of PD3, PD4 and RW3 were found to be 40μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 6.5μM, respectively. In VV-spiked plasma samples, the virucidal activity of PD3, PD4 and RW3 was close to 100% (90–100-fold reduction). Overall, the present study constitutes a new proof-of-concept in developing peptide therapeutics for vaccinia virus infections in biothreat scenarios and as in vitro viral reduction agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
