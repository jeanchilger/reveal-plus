Work was carried out in 22 sheep farms, with (i) flock size over 150 animals, (ii) presence of clinical signs of diarrhoea in lambs in the flock and (iii) close and continuous contact and movement of shepherd dogs within the animal shed of each farm. Faecal sample collection from lambs was performed within 48h of onset of clinical signs and prior to administration of any antimicrobial or antiparasitic medication to lambs. Faecal samples were also collected from puppies in the farm. In total, samples were collected from 126 lambs and 58 puppies. Samples were processed by using established techniques for isolation of bacteria, detection of viruses and observation of protozoan oocycts. Escherichia coli isolates obtained during the study, were tested for antimicrobial resistance against a variety of antimicrobial agents. In total, 236 bacterial isolates were recovered from faecal samples of lambs and 165 isolates from faecal samples of puppies. E. coli was the most frequently isolated microorganism: 104 isolates from lambs and 109 isolates from puppies were recovered. Other bacteria isolated were Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., (lambs and puppies), Clostridium perfringens, Citrobacter freundi, Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae (only lambs) and Streptococcus spp. (only puppies). Group A Rotavirus was detected in samples from lambs (2.5%) and Parvovirus in samples from puppies (5%). Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were observed in samples from lambs and puppies. This is the first report of isolation of S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and of detection of Rotavirus from lambs in Greece. Rates of E. coli isolates from puppies resistant to antimicrobial agents were, in general, smaller than respective rates in isolates from lambs. Two pairs of isolates from the same farm (one from a lamb and one from a puppy) with identical patterns of resistance to antimicrobial agents were detected, which provides some evidence in support of a hypothesis that members of each pair might possibly have been spread from one animal species to the other.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
