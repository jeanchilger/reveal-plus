The selection of aerosol delivery system for hospitalized children can have a significant impact on the utilization of healthcare resources. DESIGN AND SETTING: A quality improvement project to evaluate the impact of conversion to MDI-spacer to administer bronchodilators (BDs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) to hospitalized children on the utilization of hospital resources. The project was conducted in a tertiary pediatric ward from April to May 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The project was conducted over a six-week period. In the first two weeks, data were gathered from all hospitalized children receiving BDs and/or ICSs by nebulizers. This data collection was followed by a two-week washout period during which training of healthcare providers and operational changes were implemented to enhance the conversion to MDI-spacer. In the last two weeks, data were gathered from hospitalized children after conversion to MDI-spacer. The primary outcomes included the mean time (in minutes) of medication preparation and delivery. Secondary outcomes included the following: need for respiratory therapy assistance, estimated cost of treatment sessions, and patient/caregiver satisfaction. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-five treatment sessions were enrolled (288 on nebulizers, 287 on MDI-spacer). The nebulizer group had more male predominance and were slightly older compared to the MDI-spacer group (male: 59% vs. 53% and mean age: 52 vs. 40 months respectively). The duration of treatment preparation and delivery was significantly lower in the MDI-spacer group (2 min reduction in preparation time and 5 min reduction in delivery time; p < 0.01). Caregivers mastered MDI-spacer use after an average of two observed sessions, eliminating the need for respiratory therapy assistance during the hospital stay. Medication cost analysis showed savings in favor of MDI-spacer (cost reduction per 100 doses: 50% for albuterol, 30% for ipratropium bromide, and 87% for ICSs). The patient satisfaction survey showed “very good” to “excellent” levels in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Conversion to MDI-spacer for BDs and ICSs administration in hospitalized children improve hospital resource utilization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
