This infectious disease results in significant losses in the swine industry and specific anti-PRRSV drugs are needed. In this study, we evaluated a novel class of antisense compounds, peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs), for their ability to suppress PRRSV replication in cell culture. P-PMOs are analogs of single-stranded DNA and contain a modified backbone that confers highly specific binding to RNA and resistance to nucleases. Of six P-PMOs tested, one (‘5UP1’), with sequence complementary to the 5′-terminal 21 nucleotides of the PRRSV genome, was found to be highly effective at reducing PRRSV replication in a specific and dose-dependent manner in CRL11171 cells in culture. 5UP1 treatment generated up to a 4.5log reduction in infectious PRRSV yield, while a control P-PMO had no effect on viral titer. Immunofluorescence assay with an anti-PRRSV monoclonal antibody confirmed the titer observations. The sequence-specificity of 5UP1 effect was confirmed in part by a cell-free luciferase reporter assay system, which showed that 5UP1-mediated inhibition of translation decreased if the target-RNA contained mispairings in relation to the 5UP1 P-PMO. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the production of PRRSV negative-sense RNA was reduced if 5UP1 was added to cells at up to 6h post-virus inoculation. Cell viability assays detected no cytotoxicity of 5UP1 within the concentration-range of this study. These results indicate that P-PMO 5UP1 has potential as an anti-PRRSV agent.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
