<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-10-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Galliformes and Columbiformes</TITLE><BODY>Galliformes and columbifomes are closely associated with humans and some species have been domesticated for well over 5000 years. Both orders remain diverse, ranging from the common domestic poultry species (e.g., chicken, turkey, and squabs) to the more exotic species found in the wild and in zoological collections. While many species have been benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges, others have declined in numbers and some have become threatened (e.g., Trinidad piping-guan and wood quail) or even extinct (e.g., dodo and passenger pigeon). Nondomestic galliformes and columbiformes are susceptible to many of the same diseases that occur in domestic species, yet predisposition may be different. Furthermore, disease prevalence depends on exposure and potential risk factors. Infectious diseases that tend to be more common under intensive commercial production may not pose as great a risk to exotic and free-living species.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
