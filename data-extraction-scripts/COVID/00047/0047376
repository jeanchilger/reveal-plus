The separation and purification of glycyrrhizin from a methanol–water (70:30 (v/v)) extract of liquorice roots was achieved using high-speed counter-current chromatography. The separation was performed at a preparative scale in a one-step separation with a two-phase solvent system composed of ethyl acetate–methanol–water (5:2:5 (v/v)). The lower phase was used as the mobile phase in the head-to-tail elution mode. The present method yielded 42.2mg glycyrrhizin at 96.8% purity from 130mg of the crude exact with 95.2% recovery as determined by HPLC analysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
