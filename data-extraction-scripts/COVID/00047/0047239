Method Patients≥18years old who either had not received corticosteroid or had taken corticosteroids within 14days from symptom onset were included. Patients receiving corticosteroids beyond 15days or other investigational treatment within 21days from symptom onset were excluded. Of 1313 eligible patients, 1287 with major corticosteroid dosage-type combinations were analysed. Results Crude death rate was lower among 1188 steroid-treated patients compared to 99 patients in Group No Steroid (17.0% vs. 28.3%). Among four corticosteroid groups studied, mortality was lowest in the low-dose oral prednisolone (Group P) and high-dose methylprednisolone (Group MP) groups. On multivariate analysis of the corticosteroid groups, independent factors related to death were: corticosteroid group, older age, co-morbidity, worse chest X-ray score, worse respiratory status at Days 8–10 and higher admission white cell count. Again Groups P and MP had significantly lower adjusted odds ratios for death and lower bacterial and fungal culture rates. Despite worse chest X-ray scores and higher cumulative corticosteroid dosages in Group MP compared to Group P, fewer patients required rescue pulsed corticosteroid. Patients on hydrocortisone (Group HC) had the highest positive culture rates. Conclusion We speculate that corticosteroid with higher in-vitro inflammatory potency administered at timing and dosages commensurate with disease severity may be conducive to better outcome from SARS as a consequence of more effective control of immunopathological lung damage.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
