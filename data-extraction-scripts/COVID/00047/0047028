<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Recent advancements for the evaluation of anti-viral activities of natural products</TITLE><BODY>Significant progress has been achieved for the development of novel anti-viral drugs in the recent years. Large numbers of these newly developed drugs belong to three groups of compounds, nucleoside analogues, thymidine kinase-dependent nucleotide analogues and specific viral enzyme inhibitors. It has been found that the natural products, like plant extract, plant-derived compounds (phytochemicals) and so on, as well as traditional medicines, like Ayurvedic, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Chakma medicines and so on, are the potential sources for potential and novel anti-viral drugs based on different in vitro and in vivo approaches. In this chapter some of these important approaches utilised in the drug discovery process of potential candidate(s) for anti-viral agents are being discussed. The key conclusion is that natural products are one of the most important sources of novel anti-viral agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
