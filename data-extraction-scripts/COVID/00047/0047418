Risk modifiers include abuse of alcohol and tobacco, malnutrition, and obesity. The Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) and the simplified Early Acute Lung Injury Score predict ARDS based on clinical and investigational criteria. Hospital-acquired ARDS may result from a medley factors of which high tidal volume ventilation, high oxygen concentration, and plasma transfusion are most commonly implicated. The Checklist for Lung Injury Prevention (CLIP) has been developed to ensure compliance with evidence-based practice that may affect ARDS occurrence. To date, no pharmacologic intervention has been shown to prevent ARDS&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
