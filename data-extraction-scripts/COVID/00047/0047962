Occupational and sports medicine research has attempted to determine a non-invasive proxy for core temperature particularly when access to participants is limited and thermal safety is of a concern due to protective encapsulating clothing, hot ambient environments and/or high endogenous heat production during athletic competition. This investigation aimed to determine the validity of inner canthus of the eye temperature (T EC) as an alternate non-invasive measure of intestinal core temperature (T C) during rest, exercise and post-exercise conditions. Twelve physically active males rested for 30min prior to exercise, performed 60min of aerobic exercise at 60% V̇O2max and passively recovered a further 60min post-exercise. T EC and T C were measured at 5min intervals during each condition. Mean differences between T EC and T C were 0.61°C during pre-exercise, −1.78°C during exercise and −1.00°C during post-exercise. The reliability between the methods was low in the pre-exercise (ICC=0.49 [−0.09 to 0.82]), exercise (ICC=−0.14 [−0.65 to 0.44]) and post-exercise (ICC=−0.25 [−0.70 to 0.35]) conditions. In conclusion, poor agreement was observed between the T EC values measured through IRT and T C measured through a gastrointestinal telemetry pill. Therefore, T EC is not a valid substitute measurement to gastrointestinal telemetry pill in sports and exercise science settings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
