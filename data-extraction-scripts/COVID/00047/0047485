We present a reproducible experimental infection model for BRSV in 2–5-month-old, conventionally reared Jersey calves. Thirty-four colostrum-fed calves were inoculated once by aerosol and intratracheal injection with BRSV. Respiratory disease was recorded in 91% of the BRSV-inoculated calves, 72% had an accompanying rise in rectal temperature and 83% exhibited >5% consolidation of the lung tissue. The disease closely resembled natural outbreaks of BRSV-related pneumonia, and detection of BRSV in nasal secretions and lung tissues confirmed the primary role of BRSV. Nine mock-inoculated control calves failed to develop respiratory disease. This model is a valuable tool for the study of the pathogenesis of BRSV and for vaccine efficacy studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
