The use of molecular epidemiology to document RSV transmission in the outpatient setting has not been well described. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of two nosocomial outbreaks of RSV at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA). Subjects included patients seen at the SCCA with RSV detected in two outbreaks in 2007-2008 and 2012, and all employees with respiratory viruses detected in the 2007-2008 outbreak. A subset of samples was sequenced using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the RSV attachment glycoprotein coding region. RESULTS: Fifty-one cases of RSV were identified in 2007-2008. Clustering of identical viral strains was detected in 10 (67%) of 15 patients with RSV sequenced from 2007-2008. As part of a multimodal infection control strategy implemented as a response to the outbreak, symptomatic employees had nasal washes collected. Of 254 employee samples, 91 (34%) tested positive for a respiratory virus, including 14 with RSV. In another RSV outbreak in 2012, 24 cases of RSV were identified; nine (90%) of 10 patients had the same viral strain, and 1 (10%) had another viral strain. CONCLUSIONS: We document spread of clonal strains within an outpatient cancer care setting. Infection control interventions should be implemented in outpatient, as well as inpatient, settings to reduce person-to-person transmission and limit progression of RSV outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
