Approximate concepts are introduced to description logics based on rough set theory, and a kind of new rough description logic RDL AC (rough description logic based on approximate concepts) is proposed based on approximate concepts. The syntax, semantics and properties of the RDL AC are given. It is proved that the approximate concept satisfiability (definitely satisfiability and possibly satisfiability) reasoning problem and approximate concepts rough subsumption reasoning problem w.r.t. rough TBox in RDL AC may be reduced to the concept satisfiability reasoning problem in (almost) standard ALC (the description logic that provides the Boolean concept constructors plus the existential and universal restriction constructors). The works of this paper provide logic foundations for approximate ontologies and theoretical foundations for reasoning algorithms of more expressive rough description logics including approximate concepts, number restrictions, nominals, inverse roles and role hierarchies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
