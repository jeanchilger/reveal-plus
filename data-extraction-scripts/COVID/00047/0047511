<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-08-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Design, synthesis and evaluation of a series of acyclic fleximer nucleoside analogues with anti-coronavirus activity</TITLE><BODY>A series of doubly flexible nucleoside analogues were designed based on the acyclic sugar scaffold of acyclovir and the flex-base moiety found in the fleximers. The target compounds were evaluated for their antiviral potential and found to inhibit several coronaviruses. Significantly, compound 2 displayed selective antiviral activity (CC(50) > 3x EC(50)) towards human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, but not severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. In the case of HCoV-NL63 the activity was highly promising with an EC(50) < 10 μM and a CC(50) > 100 μM. As such, these doubly flexible nucleoside analogues are viewed as a novel new class of drug candidates with potential for potent inhibition of coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
