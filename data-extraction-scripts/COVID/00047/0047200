We investigated the ability of murine glial cells of different ages to stimulate clones of allospecific T lymphocytes. We also investigated the effects of supernatants from cultures of activated T cells on the immunologic recognition of MHC antigens on murine glial cells. Lymphocyte clones specific for Class I, Class II and non-MHC, background antigens were obtained from C57B1/6J-anti-DBA/2 mixed lymphocyte cultures. Glial cell cultures were prepared from newborn syngeneic (C57B1/6J) and allogeneic (DBA/2) mouse brains. Glial cultures 1–4 weeks of age were able to stimulate α-Class I-specific clones. No stimulation of α-Class II or α-background clones was noted. Incubation of glial cells with supernatants from cultures of alloantigen-activated spleen cells (C57131/0-anti-DBA/2) resulted in a decreased ability of glial cells to stimulate a-Class I responses. In contrast supernatant-treated cultures acquired the capacity to stimulate a-Class II-specific clones. No responses were noted in clones responsive to non-MHC antigens. The ability to stimulate α-Class II-specific clones was most prominent with one-week-old glial cultures and was lost by four weeks of culture. The increased susceptibility of younger glial cultures to the modulatory effects of lymphokines from activated T cells may be a factor in the increased susceptibility of the immature central nervous system to persistent viral infections and the development of autoimmune phenomena.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
