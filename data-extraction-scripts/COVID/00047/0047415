The reovirus isolate showed an atypical hemagglutination pattern and a retarded electrophoretic mobility of the S1 segment, which is characteristic of MRV type 3 (MRV-3). Assignment of the isolated virus to MRV-3 was confirmed by type-specific RT-PCR assays, targeting the S1 gene, and by subsequent sequence analysis of the PCR product. By phylogeny based on the S1 gene of several MRVs, the isolate fell into lineage E, along with the murine strain T3C9/61 and the bovine strains T3C18/61 and T3C31/59. Conversely, L1 sequences were found to segregate regardless of the viral type. A total of 110 fecal samples, 56 nasal and 31 ocular swabs from dogs with diarrhea or nasal/ocular discharge were tested by a nested-PCR assay specific for reoviruses, and no sample was found to contain MRV RNA, a finding that is apparently in contrast with the seroprevalence (25.77%) observed in dogs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
