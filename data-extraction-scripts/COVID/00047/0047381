High levels of E1A DNA were found in the lungs of COPD patients, where its expression increased with disease severity. In lung epithelial cells, E1A increased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and interleukin-8 expression, as well as nuclear factor-κB activation, in response to inflammatory stimuli. In addition to regulating the mediators that promote emphysema, E1A upregulates transforming growth factor-β1 expression in bronchiolar epithelial cells and transforms lung epithelial cells to express mesenchymal markers. These results support its additional role in the airway remodeling process reported in COPD.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
