Immune suppression is thought to be crucial in disease progression. However, data on immune responses during SFTS are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in CD4 T-cell subsets throughout the entirety of infection and analyse their relationships with disease severity in SFTS patients. In parallel with CD4 T-cell depletion, decreased Th1, Th2 and Treg numbers, but comparable Th17-cell numbers, were observed in deceased patients compared with those in surviving patients. Additionally, increased Th2 and Th17-cell percentages in the residual CD4 T-cell population led to aberrant Th2/Th1 and Th17/Treg ratios, which were positively correlated with disease severity. Collectively, our data indicated that CD4 T-cell deficiency, Th2 and Th17 bias were closely correlated with the severity of SFTS, indicating therapeutic potential of early immune interventions to ameliorate disease severity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
