Drugs that inhibit the ion channel formed by the 3a protein can be expected to inhibit virus release, and would be a source for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Here we demonstrate that emodin can inhibit the 3a ion channel of coronavirus SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 as well as virus release from HCoV-OC43 with a K 1/2 value of about 20μM. We suggest that viral ion channels, in general, may be a good target for the development of antiviral agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
