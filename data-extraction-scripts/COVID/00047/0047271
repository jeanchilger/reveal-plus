Methods Cross-sectional survey research design and purposive sampling were used in this study, for which 50 men and 50 women were recruited from a medical center in northern Taiwan. Results After coronary artery bypass graft surgery, both male and female patients used more problem-focused coping strategies than emotion-focused coping strategies. In comparison with men, women tended to use more blaming of self and had slightly higher scores on both state and trait anxiety. Conclusion Clinicians need to be aware that the use of appropriate coping strategies can reduce patient anxiety, a finding that needs to be considered when designing effective interventions for these patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
