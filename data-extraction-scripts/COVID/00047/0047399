<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Attitudes to basic life support among medical students following the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong</TITLE><BODY>Summary Background In 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affected 1755 people in Hong Kong, including 386 health care professionals, some of whom were infected during resuscitation attempts of affected patients. This study seeks to explore whether this epidemic has altered the willingness of Hong Kong medical students to perform basic life support and mouth-to-mouth ventilation during an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods A questionnaire was used to survey Year 4 medical students at the end of their undergraduate anaesthesia attachment, during which basic life support (BLS) skills were taught. The survey was conducted during July and August 2003, approximately two months after Hong Kong was removed from the World Health Organisation SARS Infected Areas list, and was designed to examine student confidence in BLS skills, their perceptions of the risks associated with performing BLS and their willingness to perform BLS in varying situations. Results The response rate was over 60% (35 from a possible 54). Students were positive regarding the adequacy of their BLS training. They were concerned about disease transmission during resuscitation but were less positive regarding whether the risks had increased due to SARS. In all situations they were significantly more likely to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation for a family member compared with a stranger (p <0.001) and to withhold mouth-to-mouth ventilation if either vomit or blood were present in the victim's mouth. Conclusions Hong Kong medical students feel able to perform BLS if required. They are concerned about the risk of disease transmission, including SARS, during resuscitation, but would be more likely to withhold mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in the presence of vomit or blood than due to a fear of contracting SARS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
