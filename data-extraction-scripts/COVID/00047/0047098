<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-09-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Introduction to Food Irradiation and Medical Sterilization</TITLE><BODY>This chapter is comprehensive overview of sterilization and disinfectant processes used for food-borne disease control and medical sterilization. Pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and endospores are described along with other infectious agents. The processes for controlling these infectious agents in food are summarized. These processes include not only irradiation by the two most important processes, electron beam and gamma ray, but by other processes such as ultraviolet, microwave, and infrared radiation. Medical sterilization and disinfectant processes are reviewed. Besides irradiative processes, thermal processes such as steam autoclave and dry heat are reviewed. Many liquid and gaseous chemical disinfectants are covered. The commercially important ethylene oxide sterilization process is discussed. Dealing with bioterrorism agents is briefly discussed. Throughout this chapter, the mechanisms, the irradiation, sterilization, and chemical disinfectant processes used to destroy the pathogens are discussed often in chemical detail.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
