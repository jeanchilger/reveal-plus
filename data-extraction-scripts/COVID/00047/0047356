The virus, named Bo-Circo-like virus CH, has a circular genome with 3909 nucleotides (nt). Six putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, including Rep, capsid (Cap) and four proteins of unknown function. Both the genome size and the number as well as the organization of encoded ORFs, Bo-Circo-like virus CH is most closely related to Po-Circo-like virus 21 detected in pig faeces. A preliminary survey using specific primers for the Rep region showed that 5.3% (4/75) of diarrheic samples were positive for Bo-Circo-like virus, and all 42 healthy samples were negative. In conclusion, our results indicate that Bo-Circo-like virus CH may represent a new virus in bovine. Further investigation is needed to determine the relationship between the virus infection and diarrhea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
