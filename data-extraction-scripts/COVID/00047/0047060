The current vaccines are less satisfactory to confer protections from heterologous infections and long-term persistence, and the need for better vaccines are urgent. The immunological hallmarks in PRRSV-infected pigs include the unusually poor production of type I interferons (IFNs-α/β) and the aberrant and delayed adaptive immune responses, indicating that PRRSV has the ability to suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses in the host. Type I IFNs are the potent antiviral cytokines and recent studies reveal their pleiotropic functions in the priming of expansion and maturation of adaptive immunity. Thus, IFN antagonism-negative PRRSV is hypothesized to be attenuated and to build effective and broad- spectrum innate and adaptive immune responses in pigs. Such vaccines are promising alternatives to traditional vaccines for PRRSV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
