<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-09-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Workers in the Food Industry</TITLE><BODY>Staphylococcus aureus is part of the common flora on the skin and mucous membranes of mammals and approximately 20–30% of humans are persistently colonized, mainly by mostly susceptible human-adapted isolates. In contrast, colonization with methicillin-resistant S. aureus is rare (approximately 1%), predominantly transient and associated with prior contact to the health care system. Additionally, in recent years livestock-associated S. aureus clones contributed to colonization in humans, especially in those working in close contact to farm animals. A considerable percentage of colonizing S. aureus isolates is equipped with enterotoxin genes. Humans carrying enterotoxigenic isolates represent a contamination source when handling food, thus generating a continuous risk of S. aureus food intoxication. Molecular characterization of isolates colonizing humans and obtained from food, respectively, enables the tracing of food-related outbreaks back to the source of food intoxication. We will summarize current knowledge about the S. aureus population colonizing humans, including those in close contact to animals and food, respectively. Additionally, we will review data on the molecular characterization of S. aureus isolates related to staphylococcal foodborne disease and the elucidation of staphylococcal foodborne outbreaks. Staphylococcal food poisoning is a common foodborne disease, mediated by the ingestion of enterotoxins produced by enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus. For several outbreaks of foodborne S. aureus disease, colonized personnel could be identified as the source of food contamination. However, because of the widespread occurrence of enterotoxigenic strains as human colonizers and the often transient nature of colonization, the source of contamination cannot always be identified unambiguously. Therefore, compliance with hygiene measures is the most important requirement to prevent food contamination by both human colonization and environmental S. aureus reservoirs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
