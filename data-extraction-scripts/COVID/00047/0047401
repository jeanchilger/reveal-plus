While research has mainly focused on virus associated autoimmune activation, less is known about prevention of autoimmunity, especially following resolving infections associated with CNS tissue damage. This review discusses novel insights on control of self-reactive (SR) T cells activated during neurotropic coronavirus-induced demyelination. A new concept is introduced that SR T cells can be dampened by distinct regulatory mechanisms in the periphery and the CNS, thereby preventing autoimmune disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
