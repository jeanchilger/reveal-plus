<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-10-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Nanomaterials in Biosensors: Fundamentals and Applications</TITLE><BODY>With the recent advancement of nanomaterials and nanostructured materials, the point-of-care biosensor devices have shown a potential growth to revolutionize the future personalized health care diagnostics and therapy practices. This chapter deals with the fundamentals of nanomaterials-based biosensors. The first chapter covers the brief details of nanotechnology with its types and an introduction to the synthesis of nanomaterials and their importance to construct transducers. The different components of transducers such as electrochemical, optical, piezoelectric, thermal, surface plasmon resonance, and so on for biosensors have been explained in this chapter. Various principles utilized for development of enzymatic biosensors, immunosensors, DNA, and whole-cell biosensors have been included in this chapter. Immobilization of bioreceptors is a crucial step to fabricate biosensors and their stepwise demonstration and conjugation of nanomaterials with nanomaterials have been described.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
