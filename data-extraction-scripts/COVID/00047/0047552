Purpose To compare the differences between northern and southern hospitals in Mainland China with respect to nurses’ job satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey design was selected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent t test, chi-square test, correlation, and linear regression. Results Nurses in northern hospitals were older, had higher educational levels yet received lower pay in comparison with their counterparts in the southern region. Despite these salary differences, those in the north consistently rated their job satisfaction greater in all areas except professional opportunities. Conclusion Regional differences were related to nurses’ job satisfaction. Potential contributing factors included philosophical, cultural, and economic differences between the 2 regions. The noteworthy regional differences that potentially related to nurse’ job satisfaction should be investigated in future studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
