With the continuing spread of MERS-CoV, prophylactic and therapeutic treatments are urgently needed. In this study, we prepared purified equine F(ab’)2 from horses immunized with MERS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing MERS-CoV S, M and E proteins. Both IgG and F(ab’)2 efficiently neutralized MERS-CoV replication in tissue culture. Passive transfer of equine immune antibodies significantly reduced virus titers and accelerated virus clearance from the lungs of MERS-CoV infected mice. Our data show that horses immunized with MERS-CoV VLPs can serve as a primary source of protective F(ab’)2 for potential use in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of exposed or infected patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
