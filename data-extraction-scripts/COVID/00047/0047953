The overall identities as determined through pairwise analyses of nucleotide sequences of the entire 1.78kb region ranged from 90 to 99%, with the 5b open reading frame (ORF) having the greatest identity (94–99%) while the identities of the E, 5a and M ORFs ranged from 87 to 100%. Nucleotide sequencing of recent field isolates from Alabama (Ala1) and California (Cal3) revealed distinct shifts in homology in the M gene, indicating two apparent recombination events between the Holland 52/Mass41-like strain and an Ark-like strain, both origins of commonly used vaccine strains. Putative sites of recombination could also be identified in both the E and M ORFs of laboratory strains of IBV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
