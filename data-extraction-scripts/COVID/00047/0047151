Over a month since the outbreak, more than 13,000 patients with COVID-19 have be cured and discharged from hospital until now. For the clinical cure criteria in China, twice successive negative results of Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid detection are the important index, in addition to normal body temperature for 3 days as well as obvious improvement in respiratory symptoms and CT scan [2]. In the present work, we reported that Sars-Cov-2 nucleic acid was still detectable in sputum obtained by nebulization from a cured patient. On January 22, a 49-year-old man presented himself with fever for 4 days to a clinic. Throat swab detection was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the diagnostic criteria [2] as follows (1): the positive result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection (2); a history of short stay in Wuhan within 14 days; and (3) symptoms of fever, and multiple patchy areas of ground-glass opacity on CT scan. After the active treatment, the patient recovered from fever and other respiratory symptoms on February 4. On February 9 and February 10, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was successively negative in his throat swab samples. The CT scan result showed that the inflammation was significantly decreased in both lungs. Both the results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection and CT scans indicated a recovery trend, and the patient was ready for discharge. On February 13, the throat swab and sputum by nebulization were collected before the patient was discharged. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was still detected in sputum from the patient although negative result of throat swab detection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
