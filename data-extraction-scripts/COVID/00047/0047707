Here we identify the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein as a previously unrecognized component of the IFN response. IFN stimulates an association between PLZF, the promyelocytic leukemia protein and histone deacetylase 1, to induce a decisive subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consequently, PLZF-deficient mice have a specific ISG defect and as a result are more susceptible to viral infection. This susceptibility correlates with a marked decrease in the expression of the key antiviral mediators and an impaired IFN-mediated induction of natural killer cell function. These results provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of IFN signaling and the induction of innate antiviral immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
