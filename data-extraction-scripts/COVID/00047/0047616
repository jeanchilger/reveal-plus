We developed an optimal design algorithm that calculates optimal observation times in conjunction with optimal experimental perturbations in order to maximize the amount of information gained from longitudinal data derived from such experiments. We applied the algorithm to a validated model of a synthetic Brome Mosaic Virus (BMV) gene network and found that optimizing experimental perturbations may substantially decrease uncertainty in estimating BMV model parameters.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
