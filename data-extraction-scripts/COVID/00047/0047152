In this report, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method was developed to assess the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Two internally quenched fluorogenic peptides, 1NC and 2NC, corresponding to the N-terminal and the C-terminal autocleavage sites of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, respectively, were used as substrates. SARS-CoV 3CLpro seemed to work more efficiently on 1NC than on 2NC in trans-cleavage assay. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the His41 residue, the N-terminal 7 amino acids, and the domain III of SARS-CoV 3CLpro were important for the enzymatic activity. Antibodies recognizing domain III could significantly inhibit the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The effects of class-specific protease inhibitors on the trans-cleavage activity revealed that this enzyme worked more like a serine protease rather than the papain protease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
