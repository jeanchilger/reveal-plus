<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME VACCINES</TITLE><BODY>The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected over 1600 individuals with nearly 600 deaths since it was first identified in human populations in 2012. No anti-viral therapies or vaccines for treatment and prophylaxis are available. Here, we discuss approaches to developing MERS vaccines, including a summary of previous efforts to develop vaccines useful against human and non-human coronaviruses. A striking feature of MERS is the important role that camels have in transmission. Camel vaccination may be a novel approach to preventing the human infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
