<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Hospital-Associated Infections in Small Animal Practice</TITLE><BODY>Hospital-associated infections (HAIs) occur in veterinary hospitals of all types and sizes, and their frequency is likely to increase. Urinary tract infections, pneumonia, bloodstream infections, surgical site infections, and infectious diarrhea are the HAIs most frequently identified in veterinary medicine. A hospital infection control program, consisting of an infectious disease control officer, written protocols, and staff training, is critical to reducing HAIs and promoting patient, staff, and client health. Infection control protocols (plans) should include discussion of hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment, cleaning and disinfection, patient management, with-in hospital surveillance, and antimicrobial stewardship.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
