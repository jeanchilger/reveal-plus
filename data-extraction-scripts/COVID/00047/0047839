<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 4 Diagnosis and Methods</TITLE><BODY>Abstract A number of methodologies are currently available for viral diagnosis and basic research, ranging from immunological methods, such as ELISA, to molecular methods, such as PCR-based diagnosis. Other immunological methods include immunofluorescence assay and immunoblot. In addition, some classical methods, such as plaque assay and hemagglutination, are still utilized in laboratories. Tissue culture is conveniently used for virus cultivation and propagation. Experimental animals are used for studies involving viral pathogenesis. Density gradient centrifugation is used for the purification of virus particles. Finally, molecular methods are used for the genetic analysis (ie, mutation) of viral gene function by using the replicon.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
