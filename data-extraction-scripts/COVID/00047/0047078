Objective We aimed to compare characteristics, complications, and outcomes between severe RV- and influenza virus (IFV)-associated pneumonia in adults. Study design We used prospective cohort data of adult patients with severe pneumonia who had been admitted to the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital over a 4-year period. The clinical features and outcomes of 27 patients with RV-positive bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were compared to those of 51 pneumonia patients with IFV-positive BAL fluid or IFV-positive nasopharyngeal specimens. Results Of 356 patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL and respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RV was the most commonly identified virus (8.1%) from BAL fluid. Patients with RV-associated pneumonia were more likely to be immunocompromised than patients with IFV-associated pneumonia (81.5% vs. 33.3%, p <0.001). Bacterial coinfection tended to be less common in the RV group (18.5% vs. 37.3%, p =0.09). Although septic shock was less common in the RV group (29.6% vs. 54.9%, p =0.03), other clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and radiologic patterns were similar between the groups. The 28-day mortality of patients with severe RV- and IFV-associated pneumonia was similarly high (29.6% vs. 35.3% respectively, p =0.61). Conclusions Severe RV-associated pneumonia patients were more likely to be immunocompromised and less likely to present septic shock. Overall clinical features were similar and mortalities of both groups were comparably high. Studies of larger cohorts encompassing mild to moderate pneumonia patients are needed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
