For the first time, Isatis tinctoria L. hairy root cultures were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (ultraviolet-A, ultraviolet-B, and ultraviolet-C) in an attempt to promote the production of pharmacologically active flavonoids. Results showed that the maximum flavonoid accumulation (7259.12 ± 198.19 μg/g DW) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures treated by 108 kJ/m2 dose of UV-B radiation increased 16.51-fold as compared with that in control (439.68 ± 8.27 μg/g DW). Additionally, antioxidant activity enhancement and cell wall reinforcement were found in the treated I. tinctoria hairy root cultures, indicating the positive-feedback responses to oxidative stress mediated by ultraviolet-B radiation. Moreover, the expression of chalcone synthase gene was tremendously up-regulated (up to 405.84-fold) in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures following ultraviolet-B radiation, which suggested chalcone synthase gene might play a crucial role in flavonoid augmentation. Overall, the present work provides a feasible approach for the enhanced production of biologically active flavonoids in I. tinctoria hairy root cultures via the simple supplementation of ultraviolet-B radiation, which is useful for the biotechnological production of these high-added value compounds to fulfil the ever-increasing demand in pharmaceutical fields.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
