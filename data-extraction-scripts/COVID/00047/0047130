While antigen detection techniques are widely used in Clinical Microbiology laboratories, for the diagnosis of viruses, some parasites and some bacteria, molecular techniques are routinely used only for some pathogens (such as Clostridium difficile). However, molecular techniques are constantly evolving, and they allow a rapid diagnosis for an increasing number of pathogens, with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, they are also able to detect virulence factors or resistance mechanisms. Syndromic surveillance systems, which detect different pathogens simultaneously, are very promising because they enable the most frequent pathogens to be diagnosed in a few hours and they can be very useful in certain patients. For the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection, molecular techniques are able to detect bacteria and its resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, allowing the most appropriate treatment to be selected for each patient when bacterial culture is not possible.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
