Chemical modifications of the T-ag polypeptide may be important for its multifunctional capacity. T-ag is additionally modified by glycosylation. T-ag was metabolically labeled in SV40-infected cells with tritiated galactose or glucosamine, but not with mannose or fucose. The identity of glycosylated T-ag was established by immunoprecipitation with a variety of T-ag-specific antisera, including monoclonal antibodies. Incorporation of labeled sugar into T-ag was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled sugars, but not in the presence of excess unlabeled amino acids. Labeled monosaccharides could be preferentially removed from T-ag with a mixture of glycosidic enzymes. In addition, galactose was removed from purified T-ag by acid hydrolysis and identified as such by thin-layer chromatography. T-ag oligosaccharides were resistant to treatment with EndoH, and glycosylation was not inhibited by tunicamycin. Together, these data strongly suggest that T-ag is glycosylated. Several characteristics, including lack of mannose labeling, EndoH resistance, and tunicamycin resistance, suggest that T-ag is not an N-linked glycoprotein. Rather, these properties are more consistent with the identification of T-ag as an O-linked glycoprotein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
