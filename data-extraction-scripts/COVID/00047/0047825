Here, we show that double stranded short interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules corresponding to aMPV phosphoprotein (P) gene silence P RNA and protein expression. These siRNAs broadly reduced the expression of other viral proteins in addition to P, but did not have a discernable effect on cellular protein expression. The exposure of cells to P-specific siRNAs also led to inhibition of virus replication as evidenced by marked reduction in the progeny virion titers. Taken together, the findings suggest that exogenous P silencing siRNAs can inhibit aMPV replication with potential implications in the design of novel siRNA based prophylactics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
