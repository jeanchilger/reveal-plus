<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Fetal Thrombotic Vasculopathy Perinatal Stroke, Growth Restriction, and Other Sequelae</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Clots in the fetal circulation of the placenta may occlude or narrow the lumens of fetal vessels sufficiently to diminish the placental oxygen and nutritional exchange, causing significant reduction in placental function. When extensive, growth restriction, neonatal encephalopathy, and stillbirth may occur. Propagation of clots in other organs, such as brain, kidney, and liver, may affect the function of these organs, resulting in infarcts and neonatal stroke. This article presents an account of the placental pathology and clinical sequelae of this condition, called fetal thrombotic vasculopathy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
