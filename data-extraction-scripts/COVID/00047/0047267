Upon infection, DMVs have been shown to harbor the replicase complex of positive-strand RNA viruses such as MHV, poliovirus, and equine arteritis virus. Recently, it has been shown that autophagy proteins are proviral factors that favor initiation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here, we identified ATG5 as an interacting protein for the HCV NS5B. ATG5/NS5B interaction was confirmed by co-IP and metabolic labeling studies. Furthermore, ATG5 protein colocalizes with NS4B, a constituent of the membranous web. Importantly, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a strong colocalization of ATG5 and NS5B within perinuclear regions of infected cells at 2 days postinfection. However, colocalization was completely lacking at 5 DPI, suggesting that HCV utilizes ATG5 as a proviral factor during the onset of viral infection. Finally, inhibition of autophagy through ATG5 silencing blocks HCV replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
