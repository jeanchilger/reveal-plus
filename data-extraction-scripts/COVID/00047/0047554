However, until now no stepwise solid-phase synthesis has been accomplished due to the difficult combination of N-methyl amino acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids. We report here the first stepwise solid-phase synthesis of the anthelmintic cyclooctadepsipeptide PF1022A based on an Fmoc/THP-ether protecting group strategy on Wang-resin. The standard conditions of our synthesis allow an unproblematic adaption to an automated peptide synthesizer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
