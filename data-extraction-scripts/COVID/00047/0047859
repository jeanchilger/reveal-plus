<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Botanical immunodrugs: scope and opportunities</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Modulation of the immune system can be addressed through a variety of specific and non-specific approaches. Many agents of synthetic and natural origin have stimulatory, suppressive or regulatory activity. There is growing evidence that drugs or biological agents capable of modulating single pathways or targets are of limited value as immune-related therapies. Systems biology approaches are now gaining more interest compared with monovalent approaches, which can be of limited benefits with complications. This has stimulated interest in the use of ‘cocktails’ of immunodrugs to restore immunostasis. Botanicals are chemically complex and diverse and could therefore provide appropriate combinations of synergistic moieties useful in drug discovery. Here, the importance of traditional medicine in natural product drug discovery related to immunodrugs is reviewed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
