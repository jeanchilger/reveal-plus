Here we develop a novel mathematical model, based on the interim guidance, to examine the nonlinear transmission–treatment–donation–stockpile dynamics during an Ebola outbreak and with a large scale use of the transfusion therapy in the population. We estimate the reduction of case fatality ratio by introducing convalescent blood transfusion as a therapy, and inform optimal treatment–donation–stockpile strategies to balance the treatment need for case fatality ratio reduction and the strategic need of maintaining a minimal blood bank stockpile for other control priorities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
