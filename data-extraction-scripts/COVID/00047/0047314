Recently, however, blood transfusion service faces the challenge from emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), mainly zoonotic origin. Pathogens are microorganisms, mostly viruses, that usually require vectors for their transmission to humans. The relation of some EIDs to transfusion has been proved, in other cases it is considered likely. The paper presents views on EIDs etiology and spread and explains the epidemiologic basic terminology. It describes the principles and methods of EIDs risk assessment as well as prioritization of EIDs with regard to transfusion risk. It outlines the principles of international cooperation and rapid response to newly emerging threats. More attention is devoted to such diseases as West Nile fever, malaria, dengue and chikungunya which are recently a real epidemiological threat. Preventive measures to reduce the threat of EIDs transmission have also been discussed as well as their impact on the safety and supply of blood and blood components.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
