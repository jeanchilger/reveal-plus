Several enteropathogens are associated with diarrhea in young calves, with Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection being the most common type of colibacillosis. The rise of antibiotic resistance in a number of medically important bacterial pathogens has revived interest in the use of bacteriophages as anti-bacterial therapeutic agents. Here we describe the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study designed to evaluate the effect of an oral bacteriophage cocktail on fecal E. coli colony-forming units (CFU). Ten calves were enrolled in the study to either the bacteriophage group or the placebo group for 22 feedings. Calves in the bacteriophage treatment group (n=6) received a total of 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) (volume=5ml) of each of four bacteriophages while the placebo group (n=4) received only phosphate-buffered saline (5ml). Fresh fecal samples and blood samples were collected daily from each calf and analyzed for bacterial count and presence of bacteriophage. E. coli-infecting phages were recovered from all phage-treated calves at concentrations of 10² to 10³ PFU per gram of rectal contents, but none was detected in serum. Phage treatment caused a reduction in fecal E. coli when compared to the control group: the mean log CFU for the placebo-treated group was 9.25 (SE=0.42) versus 9.11 (SE=0.34) for the phage-treated group, but the difference was not statistically significant.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
