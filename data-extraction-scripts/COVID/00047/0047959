Here, we report the development of an improved molecular diagnostics tool that utilizes CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor that couples a nuclease inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) and single microring resonator biosensor, enables label-free and real-time detection of pathogenic DNA and RNA. We addressed the clinical utility of this CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor in tick-borne illnesses including scrub typhus (ST) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), whose clinical presentations are too similar to be easily differentiated. By using CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor, we achieved single molecule sensitivity for the detection of ST (0.54 aM) and SFTS (0.63 aM); this detection sensitivity is 100 times more sensitive than that of RT-PCR assay. Finally, CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor was able to clearly distinguish between ST and SFTS in serum samples within 20 min. We believe that CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor will be useful for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic tool that is suitable for immediate clinical applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
