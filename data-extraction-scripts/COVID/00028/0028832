The identification at species level among the 18 established Bcc members is an essential tool for epidemiological studies and infection control policies. In the early 2000s the epidemiology of Burkholderia cepacia (Bcc) in Argentina was characterized by the occurrence of a B. contaminans outbreak that took place in major CF centres. This situation was quite different from other countries where B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans have been the most frequent Bcc infecting species in CF patients. Although B. contaminans outbreak was studied, little is known about the evolution of Bcc epidemiology during the last years. The aim of this study was to analyse Bcc infections in CF patients (pt) attending Hospital de Niños “R. Gutiérrez” in 3 different periods between 2004 and 2014. Incidence and distribution of Bcc species have been described. 2004–2005: Incidence 13.5% (22/163 pt). B. contaminans 55.6% (10/18), B. cepacia 16.7% (3/18), B. cenocepacia and B. seminalis 11.1% (2/18), B. multivorans 5.6% (1/18), 4 nonviable strains. 2007–2009: Incidence 6.6% (12/181 pt). B. contaminans 72.7% (8/11), B. cepacia 27.3% (3/11), 1 nonviable strain. 2012–2014: Incidence 5.4% (10/184 pt). B. contaminans 90% (9/10), B. cepacia 10% (1/10). Conclusion B. contaminans remains the most frequent isolated species among the new cases of infection. Although incidence values have decreased, these results suggest the situation with B. contaminans hasn't been solved yet. More studies specially focusing on the transmission of these bacteria and the possible sources of infection are needed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
