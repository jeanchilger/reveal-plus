The identification of this protein has led to the recognition of a family of related water-selective channels, the aquaporins, that are found in animals, plants and microbial organisms. In order to provide insight into the remarkable but simple function of these membrane proteins, their structures are being elucidated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
