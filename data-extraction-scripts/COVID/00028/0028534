However, there is a lack of a method to simultaneously detect and distinguish PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels. In this study, we aimed to establish a dual ultrasensitive nanoparticle DNA probe-based PCR assay (dual UNDP-PCR) based on functionalized magnetic bead enrichment and specific nano-technology amplification for simultaneous detection and distinguish diagnosis of PEDV and TGEV. The detection limit of dual UNDP-PCR for single or multiple infections of PEDV and TGEV is 25 copies/g, which is 400 times more sensitive than the currently known duplex RT-PCR, showing better specificity and sensitivity without cross-reaction with other viruses. For pre-clinical fecal samples, the dual UNDP-PCR showed a markedly higher positive detection rate (52.08%) than conventional duplex RT-PCR (13.21%), can rapidly and accurately identify targeted pathogens whenever simple virus infection or co-infection. In summary, this study provides a technique for detecting and distinguishing PEDV and TGEV in preclinical levels, which is high sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, low cost and broad application prospect.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
