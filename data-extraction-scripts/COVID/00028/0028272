Comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke are strongly associated with the need of intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukemia. Aim and methods We made a flash survey on COVID19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web based survey. Results We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed. At the time of the survey, over 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken as well as treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. Conclusion Thus, even children receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
