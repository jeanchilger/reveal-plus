As of mid-March, Singapore remains in a containment mode with enhanced surveillance and limited community spread. Within this context, our service for pediatric eating disorder care has had to make significant adaptations to our models of service delivery as well as respond to the changing psychosocial needs of our patients. Given infection control requirements, we have instituted modular staffing for our inpatient and outpatient settings, necessitating task shifting and an increased use of technology for communication. Due to reduced outpatient capacity and the need to minimize non-urgent trips to the hospital, we have implemented telemedicine and have leveraged on partnerships with school counselors and other community partners. “Coronaphobia” has influenced our patients’ willingness to attend visits and worsened existing health anxiety for some. Responsiveness to families’ and patients’ health and financial concerns has been essential. As COVID-19 impacts more countries, our institution’s experience can provide insight into challenges and possible adaptations to providing ongoing care for eating disorder patients in this environment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
