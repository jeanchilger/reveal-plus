Methods A prospective European primary care study recruited adults with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection between Nov-Apr 2007-2010. Real-time in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to test for six common respiratory viruses. In this secondary analysis, symptom severity (scored 1=no problem, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) and symptom duration were compared between groups with different viral aetiologies using regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Additionally, associations between baseline viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) value) and illness course were assessed. Results The PCR tested positive for a common respiratory virus in 1,354 of the 2,957 (45.8%) included patients. The overall mean symptom score at presentation was 2.09 (95%CI 2.07-2.11) and the median duration until resolution of moderately bad or severe symptoms was 8.70 days (interquartile range 4.50-11.00). Patients with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV) or rhinovirus had a significantly higher symptom score than patients with no virus isolated (0.07-0.25 points or 2.3-8.3% higher symptom score). Time to symptom resolution was longer in RSV infections (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.96) and hMPV infections (AHR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.94) than in infections with no virus isolated. Overall, baseline viral load was associated with symptom severity (difference 0.11, 95%CI 0.06-0.16 per 10 cycles decrease in Ct value), but not with symptom duration. Conclusions In healthy, working adults from the general community presenting at the general practitioner with acute cough and/or suspected LRTI respiratory viruses other than influenza impose an illness burden comparable to influenza. Hence, the public health focus for viral respiratory tract infections should be broadened.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
