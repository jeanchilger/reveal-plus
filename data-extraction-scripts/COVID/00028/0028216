Morphological studies use optical and electronic microscopes to determine the physical damage on the cell-wall and the possible cell lysis that confirms the viability and microorganism death. The key parameters of the tailoring the surface of the photoactive nanostructures such as the metal functionalization with bacteriostatic properties, hydrophilicity, textural porosity, morphology and the formation of heterojunction systems, can achieve the effective eradication of the microorganisms under natural conditions, ranging from practical to applications in environment, agriculture, and so on. However, to our knowledge, a comprehensive review of the microorganism/nanomaterial interface approach has rarely been conducted. The final remarks point the ideal photocatalytic way for the effective prevention/eradication of microorganisms, considering the resistance that the microorganism could develop without the appropriate regulatory aspects for human and ecosystem safety.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
