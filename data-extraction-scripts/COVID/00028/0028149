<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-09-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Ovomucin – a glycoprotein with promising potential</TITLE><BODY>Ovomucin, accounting for ∼3.5% of total egg white protein, is responsible for the thick gel characteristics of liquid egg white. Besides its excellent foaming and emulsion capacities, it possesses anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-tumor and other bioactivities. This paper reviews compositional, structural, physicochemical, functional and biological properties of ovomucin, as well as development of methods of extraction. As one of the least defined proteins in egg white, further study is required to characterize the structure and to explore its full potential in new applications as functional foods and nutraceuticals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
