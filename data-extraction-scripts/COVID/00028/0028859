<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-10-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Pneumonia Awareness Year, 2004: Scientific Impact Through Publications in Archivos de Bronconeumología</TITLE><BODY>Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious infectious disease. Morbidity and mortality rates continue to be high in spite of major advances and steady progress in diagnosis and treatment. The economic impact of the disease is also great. It is therefore necessary to enlist the public, primary care and emergency physicians, and public policy administrators to join forces to treat and prevent pneumonia for the common good. The annual incidence of pneumonia in the population over the age of 14 years is 1.6 to 2.6 episodes/1000 inhabitants. The mortality rate is 14.1 per 100000 inhabitants, and the associated costs are €115 million annually. The RESPIRA Foundation and the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) declared 2004 to be pneumonia awareness year with the aim of coordinating efforts to raise awareness, distribute information, and foster debate.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
