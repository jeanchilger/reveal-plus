Immunological and non-immunological defences of the gastrointestinal are impaired in early life. Consequently the gut of the preterm infant is predisposed to bacterial overgrowth. A wide range of pathogenic bacteria and viruses have been isolated from infants with necrotizing enterocolitis or detected histologically. The presence of bacterial metabolites in the breath, intestinal bullae (hydrogen) and urine (D-lactate) during the course of the illness is further confirmatory evidence. The presence of bacteria or bacterial products (such as exo- and endotoxin) in the circulation will lead to ischaemia of the intestine and other organs either directly or via mediators such as cytokines or platelet activating factor. Future studies in necrotizing enterocolitis should be directed to understanding and modulating inflammatory mediators in necrotizing enterocolitis and preventing the disease with breast milk and nutritional supplements (glutamine, short chain fatty acids), chemoprophylaxis, and antibodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
