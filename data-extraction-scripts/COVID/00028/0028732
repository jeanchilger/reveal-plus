Over the past decades the application of dynamic modelling and control has aided understanding of their complexities. At the same time using such complex systems as test-beds for new control methods has highlighted their limitations (e.g. in relation to system identification) and has thus acted as a catalyst for methodological advance. This paper continues the theme of exploring opportunities and achievements in applying modelling and control in the bio- and ecological domains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
