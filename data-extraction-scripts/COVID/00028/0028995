If mishandled, it could cause disease spread and secondary pollution of dioxin. China produced huge amount medical wastes due to large population. Through a decade, medical waste centralized disposal sector rapidly developed with both incineration and non-incineration technology. With fully consideration advanced foreign technology, a set of Best Available Technology system of China gradually formed suitable for Chinese national conditions. This article placed emphasis on best available technology system of medical wastes centralized incineration facilities, and analyzed the application of technique retrofit of medical wastes centralized incineration facilities incorporated with case study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
