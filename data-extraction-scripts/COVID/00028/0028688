Such pre-vaccine assessment might allow not only population-based, but also more personalized vaccination strategies (‘precision vaccination’). If baseline immune signatures are predictive, the underlying mechanism they reflect may also determine vaccination outcome. Thus, baseline signatures might contribute to identifying interventional targets to be modulated prior to vaccination in order to improve vaccination responses. This concept has the potential to transform vaccination strategies and usher in a new approach to improve global health.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
