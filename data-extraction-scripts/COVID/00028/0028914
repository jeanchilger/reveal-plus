Besides a standard geometric Brownian motion, another two driving processes are taken into account: a stationary Poisson point process and a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. The classical harvesting problem for this model is a big difficult puzzle since the corresponding Fokker–Planck equations with three types of noise are very difficult to solve. Our main goal of this paper is to work out the optimization problem with respect to stationary probability density. One of the main contributions is to provide a new equivalent approach to overcome this problem. More precisely, an ergodic method is used to show the almost surely equivalency between the time averaging yield and sustainable yield. Results show that the optimal strategy changes with environment. An interesting thing is that the optimal strategy for each state is equivalent to the global optimality.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
