RSV was identified in 208 of the 365 specimens. In Caen, hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis had secretions mostly weakly positive (90/154) than strongly positive (64/154), in spite of specimens taken at an early stage of the disease, without any relation to the severity of bronchiolitis. Paired sera were rarely available for serology (11/154). Increasing IF antibodies are present in 7 cases, and absent with CF test. On 80 acute sera, IF antibodies were absent (21/80) or low (28/80). In the other cases (39/80), IgM activity was also detected two times out of three.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
