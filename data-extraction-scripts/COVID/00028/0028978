<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Development of the Electronic Surveillance Monitoring System on Web Applications</TITLE><BODY>Abstract This paper presents the electronic surveillance monitoring system (ESMS) via the web based application used especially for the health sector. The system is created for three purposes, the alert function for the surveillance and rapid response team (SRRT), the monitoring for inspection and evaluation, and the back-office report. With the import and export functions that are capable to retrieve electronic health record and edit the R506 and R507 data, the SRRT and local team can easily set up and manage their resources. The GPS function helps care takers to identify the geographical data for any countermeasure and action. The program is designed to submit reports automatically to the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH). The SRRT module can operate in both on-line and off-line conditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
