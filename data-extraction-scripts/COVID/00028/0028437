A total of 125 BAL samples from immunosuppressed patients submitted for PJP-IFA were tested. Surplus samples were saved and further tested by using the PJ-CMV PCR assay. Among the 125 samples, P. jirovecii was detected in 31.2% (39/125) and in 40% (50/125) of the specimens using IFA and PJ-CMV PCR respectively. Eleven of the PJ-CMV PCR positive samples were negative by direct IFA for P. jirovecii. All samples positive by direct IFA were also positive by PJ-CMV PCR. Using the direct IFA as a gold standard, the PJ-CMV PCR sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for detection of P. jirovecii were 100%, 87.2%, 78% and 100%, respectively. However, after reviewing the clinical diagnosis, the specificity and PPV increased to 100%. Of the 50 P. jirovecii samples positive by PJ-CMV PCR, 18 (36%) were also positive for CMV by the PJ-CMV PCR. The co-infection rate was found to be 37.5% (6/16) and 35.2% (12/34) in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients. This study indicated that the DiaSorin Molecular PJ-CMV multiplex real-time PCR assay has higher sensitivity than direct IFA for detection of P. jirovecii and provides rapid detection of PJ and CMV infection in BAL samples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
