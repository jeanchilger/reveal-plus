Some of the CoVs are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans. In December 2019, the world awoke to a new zoonotic strain of CoV that was named SARS-CoV-2 (standing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which has been classified as a high-consequence infectious disease. In addition, serious complications related to COVID-19 have been reported in some patients. These include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, septic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The pharmacist, as a healthcare practitioner, can play an important role in hindering the spread of COVID-19, and can be an active participant in national and community efforts to fight and contain this outbreak.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
