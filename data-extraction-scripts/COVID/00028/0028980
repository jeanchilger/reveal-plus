<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Keynote Speaker II Biomedical Engineering Research in the Social Network Analysis Era: Stance Classification for Analysis of Hoax Medical News in Social Media</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Biomedical engineering research trend can be healthcare models with unobtrusive smart systems for monitoring vital signs and physical activity. Detecting infant facial cry because of inability to communicate pain, recognizing facial emotion to understand dysfunction mechanisms through micro expression or transform captured human expression with motion device into three-dimensional objects are some of the applied systems. Nowadays, collaborated with biomedical research, mining and analyzing social network can improve public and private health care sectors as well such as research health news shared on social media about pharmaceutical drugs, pandemics, or viral outbreaks. Due to the vast amount of shared news, there is an urgency to select and filter information to prevent the spread of hoax or fake news. We explored in depth some steps to classify hoaxes written as news articles. This discussion also encourages on how technologies of social network analysis could be used to make new kinds improvement in health care sectors. Then close with a description of limitless future possibilities of biomedical engineering research in social media.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
