The intestinal flora of pigs contains several hundred microbial species, mostly strict anaerobes. A great amount of these bacteria reside in the large intestine that in adult pigs consists of mainly Gram-positive bacteria such as cocci, lactobacilli, eubacteria, and clostridia. The composition of the intestinal microflora is a result of the interaction between the microorganisms that colonize the gut and the intestinal physiology of the pigs. While a part of this microflora is constantly present in the gut (resident flora), some microorganisms have a short residence and dynamically change the composition of the microflora. The stability and diversity of this flora has a tremendous role in maintaining the health status of the pigs, especially during the suckling and post-weaning period. The digestive tract of the newborn piglet is specialized on a diet comprising milk. Therefore, a high lactase activity is present in the small intestine, at least for as long as milk comprises the dominant feed source. While several methods, including molecular-based techniques, are available to detect and identify unculturable bacterial flora of the gut, there is a need for more advanced techniques to measure the functional status of the normal flora in response to dietary feed and environmental stress.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
