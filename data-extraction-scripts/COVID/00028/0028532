<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2002-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Rotavirus outbreak in central Australia</TITLE><BODY>Abstract In May 2001, one of the largest outbreaks of Rotavirus in living memory swept through central Australia, resulting in 246 emergency department presentations and the hospitalisation of 137 children in a single month. Hundreds more throughout the region were afflicted. Of the hospitalised cases, 96 per cent were under 4 years of age and over 90 per cent were Aboriginal. There were no reported deaths from the outbreak. The response by health personnel was similar to that experienced during other natural disasters, stretching local resources beyond their normal capacity. This report summarises the pathogenesis, clinical features and treatment of Rotavirus, and describes the management of a major outbreak of this potentially lethal and devastating disease in a unique and isolated context.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
