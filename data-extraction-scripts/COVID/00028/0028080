Analysis of the viral RNA was carried out by Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. Fourteen electrophoretypes were identified. A single dominant electrophoretype was found during the first months of the rotavirus seasonal outbreak. In contrast, a large variety of RNA patterns were observed during the latter portion of the study period. Subgrouping of rotavirus isolates by a double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal-detecting antibodies showed that all strains belonged to subgroup II. Mixed rotavirus electrophoretypes appeared in 4 cases (8.16 %).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
