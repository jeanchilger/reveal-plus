Previously these viruses were known to be important agents of respiratory and enteric infections of domestic and companion animals and to cause approximately 15% of all cases of the common cold. This Review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, interactions with the host immune response and disease pathogenesis and highlights the recent identification of numerous novel coronaviruses and the propensity of this virus family to cross species barriers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
