<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-01-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Public Health Threat of New, Reemerging, and Neglected Zoonoses in the Industrialized World</TITLE><BODY>Microbiologic infections acquired from animals, known as zoonoses, pose a risk to public health. An estimated 60% of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic. Of these pathogens, >71% have wildlife origins. These pathogens can switch hosts by acquiring new genetic combinations that have altered pathogenic potential or by changes in behavior or socioeconomic, environmental, or ecologic characteristics of the hosts. We discuss causal factors that influence the dynamics associated with emergence or reemergence of zoonoses, particularly in the industrialized world, and highlight selected examples to provide a comprehensive view of their range and diversity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
