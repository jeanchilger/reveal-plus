Its genome encodes a number of proteins involved in virus survival and transmission in its hosts, in particular proteins that inhibit signaling pathways in infected macrophages and, thus, interfere with the host's innate immune response. A recently identified novel ASFV viral protein (pI329L) was found to inhibit the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway, TLR3 being a crucial “danger detector.” pI329L has been predicted to be a transmembrane protein containing extracellular putative leucine-rich repeats similar to TLR3, suggesting that pI329L might act as a TLR3 decoy. To explore this idea, we used comparative modeling and other structure prediction protocols to propose (a) a model for the TLR3–Toll-interleukin-1 receptor homodimer and (b) a structural fold for pI329L, detailed at atomistic level for its cytoplasmic domain. As this later domain shares only remote sequence relationships with the available TLR3 templates, a more complex modeling strategy was employed that combines the iterative implementation of (multi)threading/assembly/refinement (I-TASSER) structural prediction with expertise-guided posterior refinement. The final pI329L model presents a plausible fold, good structural quality, is consistent with the available experimental data, and it corroborates our hypothesis of pI329L being a TLR3 antagonist.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
