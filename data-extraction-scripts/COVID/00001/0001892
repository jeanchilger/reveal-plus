<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-04-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Human Bocavirus – Insights into a Newly Identified Respiratory Virus</TITLE><BODY>Human Bocavirus (HBoV) was discovered in 2005 using a molecular virus screening technique. It is often found in respiratory samples and is a likely cause for respiratory diseases in children. HBoV is distributed worldwide and has been found not only in respiratory samples, but also in feces, urine and serum. HBoV infections are mostly found in young children and coinfections with other respiratory viruses are often found, exacerbating the efforts to link HBoV to specific symptoms. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of recent HBoV research, highlighting some recent findings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
