<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Human bocaviruses are highly diverse, dispersed, recombination prone, and prevalent enteric infections</TITLE><BODY>A new species of parvovirus tentatively named human bocavirus 4 (HBoV4) was genetically characterized. Among 641 feces samples from children and adults the most commonly detected bocaviruses species were HBoV2>HBoV3>HBoV4>HBoV1 with HBoV2 prevalence of 21% and 26% in Nigerian and Tunisian children. HBoV3 and HBoV4 species combined were found in 12/192 cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Tunisia and Nigeria and 0/96 healthy Tunisian contacts (p=0.01). Evidence of extensive recombination at the NP1 and VP1 gene boundary between and within species was found. The multiple species and high degree of genetic diversity seen among the human bocaviruses found in feces relative to the highly homogeneous HBoV1 suggest that this world-wide distributed respiratory pathogen may have recently evolved from an enteric bocavirus, perhaps after acquiring an expanded tropism favoring the respiratory track. Elucidating the possible role of the newly identified enteric bocaviruses in human diseases including AFP and diarrhea will require further epidemiological studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
