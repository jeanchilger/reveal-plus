In the present study, we found that without any stimulation, CD4(+) T cells in pleural fluid cells (PFCs) from patients with TBP expressed significantly higher levels of CD69 than PBMCs from patients with tuberculosis (TB) or healthy donors. CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells expressed T-bet and IL-12Rβ2. After stimulation with MTB-specific antigens, CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells expressed significantly higher levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α than CD4(+)CD69(−) T cells, demonstrating that CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells were MTB-specific Th1 cells. In addition, CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells were mostly polyfunctional Th1 cells that simultaneously produced IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α and displayed an effector or effector memory phenotype (CD45RA(−)CCR7(−)CD62L(−)CD27(−)). Moreover, the percentages of CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells were significantly and positively correlated with polyfunctional T cells. Interestingly, sorted CD4(+)CD69(+) but not CD4(+)CD69(−) fractions by flow cytometry produced IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α that were significantly regulated by CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells. Taken together, based on the expression of CD69, we found a direct quantitative and qualitative method to detect and evaluate the in vivo generated MTB-specific polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells in PFCs from patients with TBP. This method can be used for the potential diagnosis and enrichment or isolation of MTB-specific Th1 cells in the investigations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
