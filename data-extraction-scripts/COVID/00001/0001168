By introducing these genes into peripheral blood memory B cells and culturing these cells with factors produced by follicular helper T cells, CD40L and IL-21, we convert them to highly proliferating, cell surface BCR positive, Ig-secreting B cells with features of GC B cells including expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase. We generated cloned lines of B cells specific for respiratory syncytial virus and used these cells as a source of antibodies that effectively neutralized this virus in vivo. This method provides a new tool to study GC B cell biology, signal transduction through antigen-specific B cell receptors, and for the rapid generation of high affinity human monoclonal antibodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
