Many natural compounds have already been found to exhibit significant anti-tumor effects. Lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae, exhibited anti-leukemia effects in vitro and in vivo. The survival rate of HL-60 cells exposed to lycorine was decreased, cell growth was slowed down, and cell regeneration potential was inhibited. HL-60 cells exhibited typical apoptotic characteristic. Lycorine can suppress leukemia growth and reduce cell survival and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. The purpose of this work is to elucidate the mechanism by which lycorine induces APL cells. RESULTS: When HL-60 cells were treated with different concentration of lycorine, the expression of p21 and TNF-α was up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Lycorine also down-regulated p21-related gene expression, including Cdc2, Cyclin B, Cdk2 and Cyclin E, promoted Bid truncation, decreased IκB phosphorylation and blocked NF-κB nuclear import. Cytochrome c was released from mitochondria as observed with confocal laser microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The TNF-α signal transduction pathway and p21-mediated cell-cycle inhibition were involved in the apoptosis of HL-60 cells induced by lycorine. These results contribute to the development of new lycorine-based anti-leukemia drugs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
