<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-12-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Human genomics and preparedness for infectious threats</TITLE><BODY>Public health preparedness requires effective surveillance of and rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks. Inclusion of research activities within the outbreak setting provides important opportunities to maximize limited resources, to enhance gains in scientific knowledge, and ultimately to increase levels of preparedness. With rapid advances in laboratory technologies, banking and analysis of human genomic specimens can be conducted as part of public health investigations, enabling valuable research well into the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
