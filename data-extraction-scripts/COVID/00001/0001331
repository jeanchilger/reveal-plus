Ten of the 41 vaccinee sera tested displayed a VSV/HCV surrogate pseudotype neutralization titer of ≥1/20, 15 of the 36 sera tested had a neutralization titer of ≥ 1/400 against HIV/HCV pseudotype, and 10 of the 36 sera tested had a neutralization titer of ≥1/20 of cell culture grown HCVgenotype 1a. Neutralizing sera had increased affinity, and displayed >2 fold higher specific activity to well characterized epitopes on E1/E2, especially to the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of E2.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
