<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>FREQUENT AND PROLONGED SHEDDING OF BOCAVIRUS IN YOUNG CHILDREN ATTENDING DAYCARE</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: Little is known about HBoV persistence and shedding and the association between HBoV detection and the onset and resolution of respiratory symptoms. METHODS: We performed HBoV testing on nasal swabs from a prospective, longitudinal study of respiratory illness in 119 children attending daycare. RESULTS: HBoV was detected in 70 children (59%), and in 106 (33%) of the 318 study illnesses. Another virus was detected in 76 HBoV+ illnesses (72%). Extended and intermittent shedding was observed, with consistent HBoV detection documented for up to 75 days. HBoV was detected in 20 of 45 asymptomatic enrollment samples (44%) and HBoV prevalence and viral load did not differ significantly between children with and without symptoms at enrollment. HBoV+ illnesses were longer than HBoV- illnesses (OR: 2.44 for symptoms > 7 days, 95% C.I. 1.41, 4.22) and illnesses with HBoV viral load ≥ 4 log-copies/mL required a visit to a health care provider more often than HBoV-illnesses (OR: 1.64, 95% C.I.: 1.02, 2.64). CONCLUSION: HBoV was more common in illnesses with greater severity. However, detection of HBoV was not associated with the presence of respiratory illness or with specific respiratory symptoms in this prospective study of infants and toddlers attending center-based daycare.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
