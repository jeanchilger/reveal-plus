However, the function of 3CL(pro )in host cells remains unknown. This study investigated how the 3CL(pro )affected the secretion of cytokines in the gene-transfected cells. RESULTS: From immunofluorescence microscopy, the localization of c-myc tagged 3CL(pro )was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected A549 cells. Expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was significantly decreased in 3CL(pro)-transfected cells by both RT-PCR and ELISA, but without changes in other cytokines, i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL12p40, TNF-α, and TGF-β. Furthermore, the protein levels of NF-kB decreased in 3CL(pro)-transfected A549 cells when compared to EGFP transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the 3CL(pro )may suppress expression of GM-CSF in transfected A549 cells through down-regulation of NF-kB production.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
