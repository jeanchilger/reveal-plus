It has been postulated but not proven that pDC accumulate in lymph nodes and induce sustained immune activation characteristic of disease. METHODS: The dynamics of the pDC response to acute pathogenic SIV infection of rhesus macaques were studied using methods to track recently divided cells. RESULTS: pDC were lost from blood and lymph nodes in acute SIV infection despite rapid mobilization and recruitment. pDC had a low frequency of infection, were uniformly activated and had increased levels of apoptosis, while maintaining normal function. CONCLUSIONS: pDC mobilization into blood and lymph nodes in acute SIV infection does not keep pace with excessive pDC loss through activation and apoptosis. The depletion of pDC from lymphoid tissues in acutely infected rhesus macaques does not support a pathogenic role for pDC in disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
