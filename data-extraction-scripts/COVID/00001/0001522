<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003-11-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome–associated Coronavirus Infection</TITLE><BODY>Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection can be asymptomatic is unclear. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV among 674 healthcare workers from a hospital in which a SARS outbreak had occurred. A total of 353 (52%) experienced mild self-limiting illnesses, and 321 (48%) were asymptomatic throughout the course of these observations. None of these healthcare workers had antibody to SARS CoV, indicating that subclinical or mild infection attributable to SARS CoV in adults is rare.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
