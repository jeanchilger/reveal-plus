In this study, the crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (amino acids 58–195) with a molecular weight of 20 kDa are reported. HCoV-OC43 N-NTD was crystallized at 293 K using PEG 1500 as a precipitant and a 99.9% complete native data set was collected to 1.7 Å resolution at 100 K with an overall R (merge) of 5.0%. The crystals belonged to the hexagonal space group P6(5), with unit-cell parameters a = 81.57, c = 42.87 Å. Solvent-content calculations suggest that there is likely to be one subunit of N-NTD in the asymmetric unit.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
