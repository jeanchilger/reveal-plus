IBV encodes 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2–nsp16) which play crucial roles in RNA transcription and genome replication. Nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) has been identified as a protein that is essential to viral replication because of its single-stranded RNA-binding ability. The gene segment encoding IBV nsp9 has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein has been crystallized and the crystals diffracted X-rays to 2.44 Å resolution. They belonged to the cubic space group I432, with unit-cell parameters a = b = c = 123.4 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. The asymmetric unit appeared to contain one molecule, with a solvent content of 62% (V (M) = 3.26 Å(3) Da(−1)).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
