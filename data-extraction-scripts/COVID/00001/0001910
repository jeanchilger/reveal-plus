<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-12-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Monkeypox Virus Infections in Small Animal Models for Evaluation of Anti-Poxvirus Agents</TITLE><BODY>An ideal animal model for the study of a human disease is one which utilizes a route of infection that mimics the natural transmission of the pathogen; the ability to obtain disease with an infectious dose equivalent to that causing disease in humans; as well having a disease course, morbidity and mortality similar to that seen with human disease. Additionally, the animal model should have a mode(s) of transmission that mimics human cases. The development of small animal models for the study of monkeypox virus (MPXV) has been quite extensive for the relatively short period of time this pathogen has been known, although only a few of these models have been used to study anti-poxvirus agents. We will review those MPXV small animal models that have been developed thus far for the study of therapeutic agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
