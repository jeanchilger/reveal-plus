In recent years, additional genes at this locus have been identified with patterns of expression that extend to cells of the myeloid lineage where many of the encoded inhibitory receptors have equally important functions as regulators of immune homeostasis. In the present review we highlight the roles of some of these receptors including recent insights gained with regard to the identification of exogenous and endogenous ligands, mechanisms of cellular inhibition and activation, regulated expression within different cellular and immune contexts, as well as functions that include the regulation of bone homeostasis and involvement in autoimmunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
