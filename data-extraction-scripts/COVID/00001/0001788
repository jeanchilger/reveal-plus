However, identifying pathogen-specific epitopes targeted by these cells has been elusive. Using MHC class II/peptide tetramers and intracellular cytokine staining, we identify T reg cells recognizing two virus-specific CD4 T cell epitopes in the coronavirus-infected central nervous system as well as naive T cell precursor pools. These T reg cells are detected at the same time as effector T cells (T eff cells) exhibiting the same specificity and can suppress T eff cell proliferation after stimulation with cognate peptide. These virus-specific T reg cells may be especially effective in inhibiting the immune response during the peak of infection, when virus antigen is maximal. Furthermore, these T reg cells express both IL-10 and IFN-γ after peptide stimulation. IFN-γ expression is maintained during both acute and chronic phases of infection. Identification of T reg cell target epitopes by cytokine production is also applicable in autoimmune disease because myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein–specific Foxp3(+) T reg cells express IL-10 and IL-17 at the peak of disease in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These results show that pathogen epitope-specific Foxp3(+) T reg cells can be identified on the basis of cytokine production.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
