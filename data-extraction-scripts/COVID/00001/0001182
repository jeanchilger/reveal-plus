<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009</DATELINE><TITLE>Synthesis and Pharmacological Evaluation of Schiff Bases of 4-(2-Aminophenyl)-Morpholines</TITLE><BODY>In the present study, a novel series of 4-(2-aminophenyl)morpholines were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral analysis. The synthesized compounds were screened for analgesic (100 and 200 mg/kg), antiinflammatory (200 and 400 mg/kg), antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. N-benzylidine-2-morpholoino benzenamine (1) and N-(3-nitro benzylidine)-2-morpholino benzenamine (3) exhibited significant analgesic, antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
