<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-05-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Synthetic Biology: Applications Come of Age</TITLE><BODY>Synthetic biology is bringing together engineers and biologists to design and build novel biomolecular components, networks and pathways, and to use these constructs to rewire and reprogram organisms. These re-engineered organisms will change our lives in the coming years, leading to cheaper drugs, “green” means to fuel our cars, and targeted therapies to attack “superbugs” and diseases such as cancer. The de novo engineering of genetic circuits, biological modules, and synthetic pathways is beginning to address these critical problems and is being used in related practical applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
