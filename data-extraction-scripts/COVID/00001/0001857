It was questioned if this is a safe vaccine. Therefore, we investigated the safety of an inactivated monovalent H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine METHODS: We focused on the H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine Pandemrix(® )and applied a self reporting questionnaire in a population of healthcare workers (HCWs) and medical students at a major university hospital. RESULTS: In total, 4337 individuals were vaccinated, consisting of 3808 HCWs and 529 medical students. The vaccination rate of the employees was higher than 40%. The majority of individuals were vaccinated in November 2009. In total, 291 of the 4337 vaccinations were reported to lead to one or more adverse reactions (6.7%). Local reactions were reported in 3.8%, myalgia and arthralgia in 3.7%, fatigue in 3.7%, headache in 3.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data together with available data from several national and international institutions points to a safe pandemic influenza vaccine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
