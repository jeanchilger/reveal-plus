<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>NKG2D contributes to efficient clearance of picornavirus from the acutely infected murine brain</TITLE><BODY>Activated murine cytotoxic T cells express the NKG2D natural cytotoxicity receptor. This receptor recognizes MHC class I-like molecules expressed on the surface of infected cells and serves to augment T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The role of NKG2D-mediated augmentation in the clearance of central nervous system viral infections has not been explored. Using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus model we found that NKG2D-positive CD8+ cytotoxic T cells enter the brain, that NKG2D ligands are expressed in the brain during acute infection, and that interruption of NKG2D ligand recognition via treatment with a function blocking antibody attenuates the efficacy of viral clearance from the central nervous system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
