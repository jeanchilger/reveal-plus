One of the mechanisms that can help resolving infection is antibody-dependent, complement-mediated lysis (ADCML) of infected cells. ADCML consists of virus-specific antibodies that bind to cell surface expressed viral proteins which result in complement activation and cell lysis. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of FIP-virus (FIPV) infected cells towards ADCML and to examine the role of the accessory proteins 3abc and 7ab in this process. ADCML assays, using FIPV strain 79-1146 and its deletion mutant strain Δ3abc/Δ7ab, were performed on: (i) CrFK cells that show surface-expressed viral antigens, (ii) monocytes without surface-expressed viral proteins due to retention and (iii) monocytes with surface-expressed viral proteins since the antibody-mediated internalization of these proteins was blocked. As expected, no ADCML was detected of the monocytes without surface-expressed viral antigens. Surprisingly, no lysis was observed in the CrFK cells and the monocytes that do show surface-expressed viral proteins, while controls showed that the ADCML assay was functional. These experiments proof that FIPV can employ another immune evasion strategy against ADCML (besides preventing surface expression): the inhibition of complement-mediated lysis. This new evasion strategy is not attributed to the group-specific proteins since lysis of cells infected with FIPV Δ3abc/Δ7ab was not detected.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
