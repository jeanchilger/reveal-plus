<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-01-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Innovations in Oligonucleotide Drug Delivery</TITLE><BODY>Oligonucleotides (ONs) are a new class of therapeutic compounds under investigation for the treatment of a variety of disease states, such as cancer and HIV, and for FDA approval of an anti-CMV retinitis antisense molecule (Vitravene™, Isis Pharmaceuticals). However, these molecules are limited not only by poor cellular uptake, but also by a general lack of understanding regarding the mechanism(s) of ON cellular uptake. As a result, various delivery vehicles have been developed that circumvent the proposed mechanism of uptake, endocytosis, while improving target specific delivery and/or drug stability. This review describes various traditional and novel delivery mechanisms that have been employed to improve ON cellular delivery, cost effectiveness, and therapeutic efficacy. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
