To date, more than 2200 laboratory-confirmed human cases have been identified in 27 countries, and more than 800 MERS-CoV associated deaths have been reported since its outbreak in 2012. Rapid laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV is the key to successful containment and prevention of the spread of infection. Though the gold standard for diagnosing MERS-CoV infection in humans is still nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) of the up-E region, an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) could also be of use for early diagnosis in less developed locations. In the present method, a step-by-step guide to perform a MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) capture ELISA using two NP-specific monoclonal antibodies is provided for readers to develop their in-house workflow or diagnostic kit for clinical use and for mass-screening project of animals (e.g., dromedaries and bats) to better understand the spread and evolution of the virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
