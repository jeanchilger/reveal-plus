In turn, viruses have developed sophisticated mechanisms to establish productive infections, counteracting the host innate immune responses. Increasing evidence indicates that these antiviral factors may have a dual role by directly inhibiting viral replication, as well as by sensing and transmitting signals to induce antiviral cytokines. Recent studies have pointed at new, unappreciated mechanisms of viral evasion of host innate protective responses including manipulating the host ubiquitin system. Viral inhibition of antiviral factors by ubiquitin-dependent degradation is emerging as critical evasion mechanism of the antiviral response. In addition, recent studies have uncovered new mechanisms by which viral encoded proteins inhibit ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modification of host proteins involved innate immune signaling pathways. Here we discuss recent findings and novel strategies that viruses have developed to counteract these early innate antiviral defenses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
