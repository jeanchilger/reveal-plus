To evaluate the diagnostic performance of laboratories an external quality assurance (EQA) study was performed in 2004. Participating laboratories (9/20) correctly detected anti-SARS antibodies in serum samples without false positive results in an immunofluorescence assay. In contrast, only 4/13 laboratories detected most of the anti-SARS antibody positive samples without false positive results using enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and/or immunoblot. The overall results clearly demonstrate that serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV remains at an early stage of development, with further technical improvements required, particularly with respect to the use of SARS specific EIAs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
