The risk of infection after transplant is determined by the interaction of several factors, including age, type of organ transplanted, type and intensity of immunosuppression, environmental exposures, and the consequences of invasive procedures. Compared with adult transplant recipients, children are at higher risk of developing primary infection with various organisms after transplantation, as they often lack previous immunity from natural exposure to many microbes and often have not completed their primary immunization series at the time of transplantation. This article provides an overview of the risk factors, timing, and types of infectious complications associated with organ transplantation in children.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
