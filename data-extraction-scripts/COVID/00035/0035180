A sensitive real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the IBV nucleocapsid gene (N) was developed to screen clinical samples for presence of IBV. Conventional RT-PCRs amplifying hypervariable regions (HVRs 1–2 and 3) of the IBV S1 gene were developed and amplificates used for nucleotide sequence-based typing of IBV field strains in Egyptian chickens directly from clinical samples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
