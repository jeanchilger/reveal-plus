Many of those who eventually died, did so in the critical (intensive) care units of various hospitals around the world, and many secondary cases of SARS arose in healthcare workers looking after such patients in these units. Research on SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) demonstrated that this virus belongs to the same family of viruses, the Coronaviridae that causes the common cold, with some important differences. Properties of this virus have been discovered which can be used to develop important infection control policies within hospitals to limit the number of secondary cases. These properties include environmental survival, transmissibility, viral load in various organs and fluids and periods of symptomatic illness during which infectivity is greatest. Various barrier methods were used throughout the epidemic to protect healthcare workers from SARS, with varying degrees of success. Treatment of SARS patients has mainly involved steroid therapy, with or without ribavirin, but there is no consensus on the best treatment protocol, as yet. This review focuses on the implications of SARS for healthcare workers and patients on critical care units.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
