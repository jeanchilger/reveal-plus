However, the benefit and cost-effectiveness vary in each country or community because they have different standard practices and health care systems. In Japan, rapid antigen tests (RATs) have been frequently used for pediatric respiratory infections. We investigated the impact and cost-effectiveness of a multiplex PCR (mPCR) respiratory panel for pediatric respiratory infections in a Japanese community hospital. Methods We replaced RATs with an mPCR respiratory panel (FilmArray®) for admitted pediatric respiratory infections on March 26, 2018. We compared the days of antimicrobial therapy (DOT) and length of stay (LOS) during the mPCR period (March 2018 to April 2019) with those of the RAT period (March 2012 to March 2018). Results During the RAT and mPCR periods, 1132 and 149 patients were analyzed. The DOT/case was 12.82 vs 8.56 (p < 0.001), and the LOS was 8.18 vs 6.83 days (p = 0.032) in the RAT and mPCR groups, respectively. The total costs during admissions were ∖258,824 ($2331.7) and ∖243,841 ($2196.8)/case, respectively. Pathogen detection rates were 30.2% vs 87.2% (p < 0.001). Conclusion Compared to conventional RATs, the mPCR test contributed to a reduction in the DOT and LOS in a Japanese community hospital for admission-requiring pediatric respiratory infections. However, a proper stewardship program is essential to further reduce the unnecessary usage of antimicrobials.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
