This disease is infectious, especially in hospital settings. Health care workers have expressed great concern, including those working in obstetrics wards, defined as high-risk areas. METHOD: Four weeks after implementation of universal precautionary measures at a teaching hospital in Hong Kong, a survey of the health care staff was conducted to identify their feelings and opinions. RESULTS: In spite of general knowledge about SARS epidemics and related mortality, most respondents stated that universal precautionary measures were not very necessary, especially in the obstetrics ward. In addition, respondents were generally dissatisfied with the measures, as most items imposed extra work, inconvenience, and burdens on the staff. CONCLUSION: Our findings reported the views and satisfaction levels of the front-line staff of an obstetric unit concerning precautionary measures against SARS. The importance of individualized design and implementation of infection control measures is highlighted and discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
