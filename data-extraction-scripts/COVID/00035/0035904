We report the synthesis of a series of 2’-homoazanucleosides, in which the nucleobase is attached to the 2’-position of the pyrrolidine ring via a methylene linker. A suitable orthogonally protected iminosugar was synthesized by ring closing metathesis and dihydroxylation as key steps and further converted to a series of 8 nucleoside analogues through Mitsunobu reaction with suitably protected nucleobases. The 5′ position of the adenine analogue was then further derivatized with thiols to afford 2 additional compounds. The final compounds were evaluated for biological activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
