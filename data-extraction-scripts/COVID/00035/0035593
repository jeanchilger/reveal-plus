The key reaction involved Friedel–Crafts tigloylation of 5,7-dihydroxy-4-n-propyl thiocoumarin 6 employing an appropriate solvent of CS2–PhNO2 in a ratio of 7:3. In its biological evaluation for anti-HIV activity, (±)-thia-calanolide A 3 demonstrated comparatively less activity with calanolide A and its synthetic analogue aza-calanolide. Further, (±)-3 has been resolved by chiral HPLC to (+) and (−)-3.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
