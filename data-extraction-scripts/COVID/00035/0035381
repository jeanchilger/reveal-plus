A total of 649 patients seen between January and May 2002 and between January and May 2003 were evaluated. Treatment characteristics and waiting times were recorded. March 20 to May 30, 2003, was defined as the peak period of incidence and was compared with the same period in 2002. During the SARS epidemic, there was a 21% decrease in the number of patient consultations and a 15% reduction in the number of patients treated with RT. There was no significant change in the tumor type or reason for referral. Short fractionation schedules were employed for 35% of treated patients compared with 34% in 2002. Patient waiting times between referral and treatment decreased during the period of interest, from 16 days to 8 days (P = 0.021). This study demonstrates a reduction in palliative RT services that is similar in magnitude to decreases observed in other essential cancer services during the SARS epidemic. Use of single-fraction RT and delayed follow-up visits may help to minimize hospital transfers and visits in the event of future infectious disease outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
