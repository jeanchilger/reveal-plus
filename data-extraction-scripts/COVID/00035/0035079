Should we change our approach?</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Introduction Kawasaki disease (KD) is a multisystem vasculitis associated with coronary artery abnormalities. Infections could be a trigger of the inflammation. The main aim of this study was to describe the presence of infections in children with KD, and to analyse the clinical characteristics and the presence of coronary abnormalities in these cases. Patients and methods A retrospective study was performed within the Kawasaki Disease network (KAWA-RACE (2011-2016). An analysis was performed that included patients with positive microbiological findings (PMF) during the acute phase, as well as those with a previous recent infection (PRI) during the 4 weeks preceding KD diagnosis. Results The study included a total of 621 children with KD, with PMF being found in 101 (16.3%) patients, and a PRI in 107 (17.2%). Significantly less echocardiographic abnormalities were found in the group with a PRI, when compared to those without a PRI (23 vs. 35%, P =.01) and also a lower proportion of overall coronary artery lesions (16 vs. 25%, P =.054). No significant differences were found in the proportion of aneurysms in either of these groups (PRI or PMF) when compared to those without infection. Conclusions In the present study, no differences were found in the incidence of coronary aneurysms in either of the groups, with or without PRI or PMF. Therefore, if KD is suspected, appropriate treatment should be started despite having a confirmed infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
