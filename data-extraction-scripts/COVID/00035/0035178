These cells resemble the typical morphology of embryonic stem cells, express pluripotency markers, and are able to transmit through germlines. To date, iPSCs of many species have been generated, whereas generation of bat iPSCs (biPSCs) has not been reported. To facilitate in-depth study of bats at the molecular and cellular levels, we describe the successful derivation of biPSCs with a piggyBac (PB) vector that contains eight reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Nanog, cMyc, Lin28, Nr5a2, and miR302/367. These biPSCs were cultured in media containing leukemia inhibitory factor and three small molecule inhibitors (CHIR99021, PD0325901, and A8301). They retained normal karyotype, displayed alkaline phosphatase activity, and expressed pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, TBX3, and TRA-1-60. They could differentiate in vitro to form embryoid bodies and in vivo to form teratomas that contained tissue cells of all three germ layers. Generation of biPSCs will facilitate future studies on the mechanisms of antiviral immunity and longevity of bats at the cellular level.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
