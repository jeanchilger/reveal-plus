In the present study, a new C-geranylated flavone, paucatalinone C (1) and five known C-geranylated flavanones (2–6) were isolated. In addition, a total of 34 C-geranylated flavonoids were detected by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS coupling techniques from the CH2Cl2 extract of P. catalpifolia. Futhermore, anti-aging effects of isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro with premature senescent 2BS cells induced by H2O2. Phytochemical results indicated that P. catalpifolia was a natural resource of abundant C-geranylated flavonoids. Diplacone (3) and paucatalinone A (5) were the potent anti-aging agents in the premature senescent 2BS cells induced by H2O2 and the C-geranyl substituent may be an important factor because of its lipophilic character.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
