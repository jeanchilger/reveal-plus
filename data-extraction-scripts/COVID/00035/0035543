This is of benefit to the mother, safeguarding the integrity of the lactating mammary gland, but also of huge importance for protection of the suckling offspring. The antimicrobial substances in milk can be classified into two categories. First, nonspecific, broad-spectrum defense substances, which have evolved over long periods of time, and secondly, substances like antibodies, which are specifically directed against particular pathogens and have developed during the mother's lifetime. Substances in both categories may be targets for biological intervention and manipulation with the goal of improving the antimicrobial properties of milk. These alterations of milk composition have applications in human as well as in animal health.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
