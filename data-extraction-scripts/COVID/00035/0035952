In our previous studies, the proteinase was identified as a 33-kDa protein in IBV-infected cells, and its catalytic center was shown to consist of H2820 and C2922 residues. It is released from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins by autoprocessing at two Q–S dipeptide bonds (Q2779–S2780 and Q3086–S3087). In this report, further characterization of the two cleavage sites demonstrates that the N-terminal Q2779–S2780 site is tolerant to mutations at the P1 position. Deletion of the C-terminal region of the proteinase shows that a significant amount of the enzymatic activity is maintained upon deletion of up to 67 amino acids, suggesting that the extreme C-terminal region may be dispensable for the proteolytic activity of the proteinase. Analysis of the autoprocessing kinetics in vitro reveals that proteolysis at the Q2779–S2780 site is the first cleavage event mediated by this proteinase. This is followed by cleavage at the Q3086–S3087 site. The occurrence of both cleavage events in intact cells is potentially rapid and efficient, as no intermediate cleavage products covering the proteinase were detected in either IBV-infected or transfected cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies further show differential subcellular localization of the proteinase in IBV-infected cells and in cells expressing the 3C-like proteinase alone, indicating that additional roles in viral replication might be played by this protein. Finally, a Q–A (Q3379–A3380) dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 10,663 to 10,668 was demonstrated to be a cleavage site of the proteinase.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
