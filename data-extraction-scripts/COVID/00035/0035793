As TRTV was known to generate polycistronic mRNAs, cDNA was generated from TRTV strain U K/3 BV/85-infected Vero cell mRNAs using an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to a region of the F gene. Sequencing of four cDNAs revealed that the gene adjacent to the beginning (3′ end) of the F gene was that for the matrix (M) protein, i.e., that TRTV had the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. This was unexpected as human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, the type species of the genus Pneumovirus, has the partial gene order 3′-M-SH-G-F-5′, where SH and G are the small hydrophobic protein and attachment glycoprotein, respectively. Instead TRTV resembled the Morbillivirus and Paramyxovirus genera of the Paramyxoviridae (subfamily Paramyxoviridae) which have the partial gene order 3′-M-F-5′. Two further oligonucleotides, one corresponding to a sequence near the end of the M gene and the other (oligo B) to a sequence near the beginning of the F gene, with their 5′ ends spaced 300 nucleotides apart on the basis of the cDNA sequence, were used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic RNA as template. Only a PCR product of 0.3 kb was obtained. The same sized product was also obtained using these oligonucleotides and genomic RNA from three other TRTV strains (SA/91 /78, UK/8544/85, and SA/2381/88) which had been grown in chicken tracheal organ cultures. In addition PCR was performed using genomic RNA from TRTV-3BV and SA/2381/88 with oligo B and another oligonucleotide near the 5′ end of the gene upstream from M, spaced 1141 nucleotides apart on the basis of the sequence data. Only a 1.14-kb PCR product was obtained. Larger products would have been expected if another gene had been situated between M and F. The absence of such larger products, plus the demonstration that infected cells contained M-F dicistronic mRNAs, supported the conclusion that in the TRTV genome the M gene is adjacent to the F gene in the order 3'-M-F-5′. The 5′ termini of the M and F mRNAs were confirmed by mRNA mapping. The TRTV M gene encoded a protein of 254 amino acids, very similar to that of RS virus (256 residues; 37% amino acid identity) but very different from that of the morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (approximately 350 residues). Thus, on the basis of the sequences of both the M and the F genes, TRTV is more closely related to the pneumoviruses than to the paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
