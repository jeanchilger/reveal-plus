However, many host-targeted agents are natural products which can be difficult to optimize using synthetic chemistry alone. We describe the orthogonal combination of bioengineering and semisynthetic chemistry to optimize the drug-like properties of sanglifehrin A, a known cyclophilin inhibitor of mixed non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide origin in order to generate the drug candidate NVP018 (formerly BC556). NVP018 is a potent inhibitor of HBV, HCV and HIV-1 replication, shows minimal inhibition of major drug transporters and has a high barrier to generation of both HCV and HIV-1 resistance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
