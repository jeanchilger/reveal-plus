Sponsored by the Japan Society of Applied Physics with co-sponsorship by the 162nd Committee on Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Photonic and Electronic Devices of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, technical sessions focused on topics ranging from growth and material characterisation to fabrication and commercialisation of devices such as high power FETs and laser diodes. This is a review of talks related to high power devices, AlGaN/GaN FETs, that have recently been the focus of intense scrutiny and may replace GaAs technology in the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
