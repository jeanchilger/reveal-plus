Two membrane modules were compared in continuous operation for about 75 days. During stable operation, SMBR achieved almost complete phage removal for both membrane modules. For the 0.22μm module, the cake layer, the gel layer and the membrane contributed 6.3log, 3.1log and 1.7log, respectively to phage removal, confirming the importance of the cake/gel layer formed on the surface of membrane. The damage of the cake/gel layer resulted in the decrease of phage removal. As for the 0.1μm one, the membrane alone played a major role in phage removal. Inactivation by activated sludge and adsorption by cake/gel layer contributed about 3.6log to phage removal everyday so that there was no phage accumulation in bulk solution. The results demonstrated that SMBR was an efficient system and recommended for treatment of virus-bearing wastewater.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
