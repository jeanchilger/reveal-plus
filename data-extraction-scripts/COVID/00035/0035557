In addition, earlier investigations demonstrated that contamination of the BLV antigen-producing cell culture systems by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) may give rise to misinterpretation of serological test results after BVDV vaccination of cattle. By co-cultivation of peripheral leukocytes of a BLV-infected cow with a permanent sheep kidney cell line, a new BLV-producing cell line named PO714 was established. This line carries a BLV provirus of the Belgian species and has been tested to be free of a variety of possibly contaminating viruses and mycoplasms. Investigations of a panel of well-characterised sera by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and capture ELISA (cELISA) tests using antigen prepared from this new cell line in comparison with antigen of the well-known cell line FLK/BLV yielded comparable results. False positive results caused by BVDV cross-reactions could be eliminated when tests were carried out with antigen derived from the new cell line.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
