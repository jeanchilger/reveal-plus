Despite their strong efficacy, they need to be carried by nanoscale delivery systems that can protect them against degradation in biological fluids, increase their cellular uptake and favor their subcellular distribution. Several studies have highlighted the potential of local pulmonary delivery of siRNAs for the treatment of lung diseases. For this purpose, nanoscale delivery systems were addressed to target passively or actively the target cell. This review discusses the possibilities of approaching lung delivery of nanoscale particles carrying siRNAs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
