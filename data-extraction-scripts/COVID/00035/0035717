A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for simulating the wind flow field and the pollutant dispersion was developed and validated by wind tunnel data. Then the spreading of the pollutant emitted from different locations to a rectangular-shaped high-rise residential (HRR) building was numerically studied. The pollutant source location was set in a wide range of the position angle and distance between the source and the building. It was found that the pollutant concentration on the building decreases with an increase in the emission distance whereas the effect of the position angle is more complicated. Interestingly, there is a critical range of the position angle from which the emitted pollutants will not spread to the building in a significant way. The effect of the source location was linked to the wind flow field around the building, particularly with several major flows. The vertical distributions of the pollutant concentration on different faces were also investigated, and it was found that these are more affected by the vertical flow near each face. Finally, a mathematical model was developed to evaluate the pollutant concentration as a function of the emission distance and position angle. These findings are helpful to the understanding of the dispersion of airborne pollutants around high-rise buildings and the related hazard management in urban design.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
