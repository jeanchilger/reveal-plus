<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-03-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Pharyngitis</TITLE><BODY>Abstract “Sore throat” or pharyngitis is one of the most frequent complaints of patients in the acute care setting, accounting for nearly 7 million pediatric and 6 million adult visits each year. On the surface, pharyngitis would appear to pose few challenges to the clinician; the site of infection is both visible and accessible for inspection and culture, and the majority of pharyngeal pathogens are self-limiting respiratory viruses. Unfortunately, the diagnosis and management of acute pharyngitis is complicated by the 10% to 30% of cases caused by bacterial pathogens, particularly group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS). Concerns over the risk of suppurative and nonsuppurative complications associated with GAS pharyngitis have fueled the widespread practice of empirical antimicrobial therapy. However, the consequences of antimicrobial overuse, measured by cost, adverse events, and bacterial resistance, have refocused attention on the need for targeted therapy based on an appreciation of the epidemiology and diverse clinical presentations of acute pharyngitis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
