Membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology presents a more efficient system at removing pathological microorganism compared with existing wastewater treatment systems. In the past 8yr, over 50 MBR plants have been successfully built for hospital wastewater treatments, with the capacity ranging from 20 to 2000m3/d. MBR can effectively save disinfectant consumption (chlorine addition can decrease to 1.0mg/L), shorten the reaction time (approximately 1.5min, 2.5–5% of conventional wastewater treatment process), and attain a good effect of inactivation of microorganism. Higher disinfection efficacy is achieved in MBR effluents at lower dose of disinfectant with less disinfection by-products (DBPs). Moreover, when capacity of MBR plants increases from 20 to 1000m3/d, their operating cost decreases sharply.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
