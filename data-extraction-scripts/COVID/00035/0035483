In routine diagnostic procedures, infection is determined by microscopy, which is not sufficient to differentiate these species. We investigated whether routine Cryptosporidium diagnostic procedures need improvement to include species determination. The relation of Cryptosporidium spp. and subtype with the clinical picture and other pathogens was also investigated. A total of 782 diarrhoeal calf samples were analysed and Cryptosporidium infection was diagnosed in 198 samples. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in 178, C. bovis in six and mixed C. bovis/C. parvum in seven samples. Twenty-seven C. parvum subtypes were identified, of which 16 were newly described. Except for three herds, only one subtype per herd was identified. Cryptosporidium parvum-positive calves were younger than C. bovis-positive calves and most C. parvum infections were seen at 1–3weeks of age. Oocyst counts were higher in C. parvum samples. Yellow faecal colour was associated with C. parvum infection. Watery faeces had no greater association with C. parvum infection, but C. parvum subtype family IIa was more common than subtype family IId in watery faecal samples. No other pathogens were detected in the six C. bovis-infected calves, indicating a pathogenic potential. Our results show that species determination does not need to be included in routine Cryptosporidium diagnostic procedures in order to estimate the clinical relevance of infection in diarrhoeal calves. The maximum age when analysis for clinical cryptosporidiosis is performed can be lowered to 6weeks of age. However, the indicated pathogenic potential of C. bovis warrants further attention.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
