<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-09-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Adrenal infections</TITLE><BODY>Summary Adrenal infections are an important but under-recognized clinical entity. The adrenal gland can be infected by a myriad of pathogens including fungi, viruses, parasites, and bacteria. Infection can directly or indirectly cause tissue damage and alteration in endocrine function. Direct damage occurs via microbial replication and local production of toxic compounds, such as endotoxins. Indirect damage results from alterations in the regulation of a host's immunologic and endocrine mediators in response to damage by a microbe at a distant site. Variations in pathogen tropism, adrenal anatomy, and host immune integrity contribute to the progression of active disease and discernable adrenal dysfunction. Early recognition and intervention in the case of adrenal infection can significantly improve outcome, demonstrating the need for increased clinical suspicion in the appropriate clinical setting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
