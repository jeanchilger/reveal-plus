The influence of structural alternations on antiviral activity was studied. Several derivatives exhibit antiviral activity against HIV and vaccinia virus (middle micromolar range), HSV-1 and HSV-2 (lower micromolar range) and VZV and CMV (nanomolar range), although the parent unbranched PEE–ANPs are inactive. Adenine as a nucleobase and the methyl group attached to the PEE chain proved to be a prerequisite to afford pronounced antiviral activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
