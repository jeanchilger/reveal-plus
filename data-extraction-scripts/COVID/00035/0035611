<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 9 Environmental and Occupational Health</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Environmental and occupational health is affected by chemical, physical, radiological, and biological agents in the air, water, and soil. Health risks include injury, and exposure to toxic radiation, carcinogenic and teratogenic agents, leading to cancer, lung and heart diseases. Environmental factors may result in instant death or long-term illness from unsafe environmental or working conditions. The environment affects populations from small workplace settings to large-scale communities, as well as having global effects. International and governmental responsibility, through policies, laws, regulations, standards, policies, and planning, is vital for tackling global aspects of pollution, including climate change, cataclysmic natural events, drought, air and water pollution, and the potentially catastrophic effects of weather changes. Preparation for disasters is a core public health function in managing the after-effects of tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, and drought. These are potent political and public health issues with huge economic and societal effects.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
