Early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial for effective treatment. Syndromic diagnostic testing using novel, rapid multiplexed molecular platforms represents a new opportunity for rapidly targeted antimicrobial therapy to improve patient outcomes and facilitate antibiotic stewardship. In this article we review the currently available testing platforms and discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of rapid testing in pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
