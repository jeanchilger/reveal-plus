<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-08-31</DATELINE><TITLE>The pandemic influenza threat: a review from the primary care perspective</TITLE><BODY>Summary Aims This paper aims to summarise the growing literature concerning an imminent future influenza pandemic, from the primary care perspective. Methods Sources of literature were scanned and relevant material short-listed for further study from: (1) WHO and CDC websites; (2) PUBMED; and (3) papers mentioned in references of full-text papers. Results Outbreaks of avian influenza in Asia and elsewhere indicate that the world may be moving towards a pandemic influenza outbreak. The WHO Global Influenza Preparedness Plan 2005 unifies the world with the vision of tackling the next pandemic influenza outbreak as a global effort that includes healthcare provider and patient alike. Conclusions We need to update ourselves and keep our staff and patients informed to make infection control measures part of our daily activities. In areas where there are contacts with animal reservoirs of influenza A, patients need to be reminded that they need to protect themselves from being infected.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
