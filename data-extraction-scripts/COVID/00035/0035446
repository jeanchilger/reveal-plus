Differential recognition of self vs non-self RNA is a considerable challenge as the inability to differentiate may trigger aberrant immune responses. Recent work identified the composition of the RNA 5′, including the 5′ cap and its methylation state, as an important determinant of recognition by the host. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the modified 5′ RNA recognition and viral antagonism of RNA receptors. Here, we will discuss RIG-I and IFIT proteins as examples of host proteins that detect dsRNA and ssRNA, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
