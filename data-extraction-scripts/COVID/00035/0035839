This retrospective study aims to introduce the system, and to utilize the data collected for further investigation of the lifespan and mortality of the domesticated cat population stratified by demographic variables. Our data revealed that 1325 domesticated cats were acquired between 2012 and 2014. The median age of the study population was 8.0 years (IQR 3.0–13.0; range 0.0–22.7). Neutered and purebred cats lived longer. The most common causes of death were renal and urologic disorders, followed by neoplasia, infection, cardiovascular disorders, and trauma. Independent factors for common causes were surveyed. Advanced age and neutering was found to be associated with death due to renal and urologic disorders as well as with neoplasia. In contrast, younger age was found to be associated with death due to trauma and infection; being unneutered and living in the capital city were found to be associated with death due to trauma. Being male or purebred was found to be associated with death due to cardiovascular disorders.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
