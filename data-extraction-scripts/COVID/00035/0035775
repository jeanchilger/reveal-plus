Information on management practices was obtained by administering a questionnaire compiled using a modified Delphi technique. Data were analyzed using univariable and multivariable negative binomial regression. Overall, 30% of the calves in the study were shedding C. parvum oocysts, with at least one positive calf detected in 77% of herds. Within-herd prevalence ranged from 0 to 80%. Predictors significantly associated with an increased prevalence of shedding in multivariable modelling were the use of calf scour prophylaxis in cows (risk ratio [RR] 1.70, P <0.01) and calves (RR 1.38, P =0.02) and the feeding of milk replacer in the first week of life (RR 1.40, P =0.02). In contrast, the presence of concrete flooring in calf housing areas (RR 0.59, P <0.01) and the use of soap or detergent when washing calf feeding utensils (RR 0.61, P <0.01) appeared to be protective.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
