Fever (> 38°C) was the earliest symptom (50/53 SARS vs. 5/31 non-SARS, p < 0.0001), preceding cough by a mean of 4.5 days. The initial chest X-ray study was normal in 22/53 SARS cases versus 5/31 non-SARS cases. SARS patients with an initially normal chest X-ray study developed infiltrates at a mean of 5 ± 3.44 days after onset of fever (21/22 SARS vs. 0/5 non-SARS). Rapid radiographic progression of unifocal involvement to multifocal infiltrates was seen in 22 of 24 SARS vs. 0 of 26 non-SARS patients (p < 0.0001). Pleural effusion was not present in any SARS patients but was seen in 6 of 26 non-SARS cases (p < 0.0001). Initial lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were all more common in SARS than non-SARS (p < 0.0001). They may help differentiate SARS from non-SARS if a reliable and rapid diagnostic test is not available.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
