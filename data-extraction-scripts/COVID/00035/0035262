Development of indicators and computational methods</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The process of translating strategic sustainability objectives into concrete action at project-specific levels is a difficult task. The multi-dimensional perspectives of sustainability such as economy, society, environment, combined with a lack of structured methodology and information at various hierarchical levels, further exacerbate the problem. This paper (Part 1 of a two-part series) proposes an analytical decision model and a structured methodology for sustainability appraisal in infrastructure projects. The paper uses the ‘weighted sum model’ technique in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and the ‘additive utility model’ in analytical hierarchical process (AHP) for multi-criteria decision making, to develop the model from first principles. It discusses the development of key performance indicators encapsulated within the analytical model. It concludes by discussing other potential applications of the proposed model and methodology for process automation as part of integrated sustainability appraisal in infrastructure design and construction. Part 2 uses a case study to demonstrate the model application in infrastructure sustainability appraisal at design stages. The paper also discusses the challenges for sustainability research, and gives recommendations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
