Vaccine platforms provide an effective tool by which strategically designed peptide and protein antigens are modularized to enhance their immunogenicity. These modular vaccine platforms can overcome issues faced by traditional vaccine manufacturing and have the potential to generate safe vaccines, rapidly and at a low cost. This review introduces two promising platforms based on virus-like particle and liposome, and discusses the methodologies and challenges.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
