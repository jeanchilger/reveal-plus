To explore non-peptidic inhibitors of HRV 3Cpro, a series of novel heteroaromatic esters was synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory activity against HRV 3Cpro, to determine the structure–activity relationships. The most potent inhibitor, 7, with a 5-bromopyridinyl group, had an IC50 value of 80nM. In addition, the binding mode of a novel analog, 19, with the 4-hydroxyquinolinone moiety, was explored by molecular docking, suggesting a new interaction in the S1 pocket.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
