The analysis draws upon data from fieldwork and documentary materials with a focus on the UK and EU (2002–05) and explores four arenas: governance and regulatory policy; commercialisation and the market; ‘evidentiality’ manifest in evidence-based policy; and publics’ and technology users’ values and ethics. The analysis suggests that there is a trend toward ‘purification’ across these arenas, both material and socio-political. A common process of partitioning is found in stakeholders’ attempts to define a clear terrain, which the field of tissue-engineered technology might occupy. We conclude that pollution ideas and partitioning processes are useful in understanding regulatory ordering and innovation in the emerging technological zone of human tissue engineering.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
