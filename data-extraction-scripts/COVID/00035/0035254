<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-02-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Pneumonia</TITLE><BODY>By nearly any criteria, pneumonia (infection of the pulmonary parenchyma) must be considered one of the most important categories of disease affecting the respiratory system. This chapter is organized primarily as a general discussion of the clinical problem of pneumonia. As appropriate, the focus on individual etiologic agents highlights some characteristic features of each that are particularly useful to the physician. Also covered is a commonly used categorization of pneumonia based on the clinical setting: community-acquired versus nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia. In current clinical practice, the approach to evaluation and management of these two types of pneumonia is often quite different. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of several infections that were uncommon or primarily of historical interest until recently, as the threat of bioterrorism emerged. In addition to reviewing inhalational anthrax, the chapter briefly describes two other organisms considered to be of concern as potential weapons of bioterrorism: Yersinia pestis (the cause of plague) and Francisella tularensis (the cause of tularemia).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
