The biological activity of metal complexes is determined by the metal itself, its oxidation state, the types and number of coordinated ligands and their strength of binding, the geometry of the complex, redox potential and ligand exchange rates. For organic drugs a variety of readily observed spin I =1/2 nuclei can be used (1H, 13C, 15N, 19F, 31P), but only a few metals fall into this category. Most are quadrupolar nuclei giving rise to broad lines with low detection sensitivity (for biological systems). However we show that, in some cases, heteronuclear NMR studies can provide new insights into the biological and medicinal chemistry of a range of elements and these data will stimulate further advances in this area.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
