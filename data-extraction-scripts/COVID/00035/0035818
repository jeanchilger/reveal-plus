Calves were separated from the dam and fed 2L of colostrum in nipple-bottles or allowed to nurse the dam for 3 d. Calves were housed in individual hutches or wooden pens in a barn. Intake of colostrum by calves allowed to nurse the dam was not controlled. Serum IgG and IgM concentrations at 24h of age were greater for calves that nursed the dam. Scours were less severe when calves were housed in hutches, but number of days scouring was unaffected by treatment. Calves fed colostrum in nipple-bottles and housed in the barn consumed more starter than did other calves from 3 to 5 wk of age. The BW were greater for calves allowed to nurse the dam and housed in hutches. Feed efficiency over the 35-d study was improved when calves nursed the dam. Optimal transfer of passive immunity and housing in hutches appeared to maximize health and growth in this study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
