Understanding the molecular basis in relation to the virulence of HP-PRRSV is essential for effectively controlling clinical infection and disease. In the current study, we constructed and rescued a serial of mutant viruses in nsp9 and nsp10 based on the differential amino acid sites between HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1/3.9. The replication efficiency in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and the pathogenicity of the mutant viruses for piglets were analyzed. Our results showed that the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of nsp9 decreased the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in PAMs, and could attenuate its virulence for piglets, suggesting that the residues 586 and 592 of nsp9 are critical sites natively in determining the fatal virulence of the Chinese HP-PRRSV for piglets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
