<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-01-17</DATELINE><TITLE>Sialoglycans and genetically engineered plants</TITLE><BODY>Plants express N-glycosylation pathways and produce N-glycosylated proteins but differ from the mammalian-type proteins. Therefore attempts are made to design and engineer plant glycosylation pathways that can produce mammalian-type glycosylated moieties so that large quantities of biopharmaceuticals compatible to the human body can be produced. Most of the studies of plant expression systems for molecular farming have been conducted on Nicotiana sp. and genetic engineering and molecular biology tools have enabled the generation of glycoengineered plant for human use in the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins. We have discussed in this chapter the advances of glycoengineering in plants with special reference to the reconstruction of silaylation pathways in plants and the latest application in the production of antibody and therapeutics in plants.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
