The research was carried out in 14 out of 16 Polish provinces in the years 2003–2005. The investigation was conducted on three types of farms: large farms (>100 sows), medium farms (25–100 sows) and small farms (<25 sows). Diarrhoea of unweaned piglets was observed on all the examined farms. Overall, 780litters of suckling piglets from 104 farms and 267 mother sows were examined. The faeces were analyzed with the modified McMaster method. Isopsora suis was found in 217 (27.8%) litters from 70 (66.7%) farms. Eimeria spp. was detected only in 20 (2.6%) litters from 12 (11.5%) farms. On the large farms I. suis infection was detected in 31.7% of litters whereas Eimeria spp. in 1.4% of them. On the medium sized farms I. suis was found in 18.1% of litters and Eimeria spp. in 0.6%. On the small farms I. suis was detected in only 13.2% of litters, whereas Eimeria spp. in as many as 28.9%. I. suis and Eimeria spp. oocysts were found in 18 (6.7%) and 16 (6%) sows respectively. From 72 sows producing I. suis infected piglets only 12 (16.7%) shed I. suis oocysts and as little as 4 (5.6%) shed Eimeria oocysts. In the remaining 56 sows (77.8%) no cases of coccidian infections were detected. The results of this investigation demonstrate the high prevalence of I. suis in suckling piglets on the large swine farms in Poland.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
