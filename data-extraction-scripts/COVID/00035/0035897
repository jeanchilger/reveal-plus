The SARS-CoV protein 6 is 63 amino acids in length and has been previously involved in virus pathogenicity and replication. To further analyze this functions, the interaction of SARS-CoV protein 6 with other viral and/or cellular factors has been analyzed during SARS-CoV infective cycle. Protein 6 immunoprecipitation from extracts of SARS-CoV infected cells and mass spectrometry analysis revealed an interaction of viral proteins 6 and 9b in biologically relevant conditions. This interaction has been reinforced by co-localization of both proteins in the cytoplasm of SARS-CoV infected cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
