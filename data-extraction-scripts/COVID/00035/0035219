Although the initial interaction of JCV with host cells occurs through direct binding of the major viral capsid protein (VP1) with cell-surface molecules possessing sialic acid, these molecules have not yet been identified. In order to isolate monoclonal antibodies which inhibit attachment of JCV, we established an immunoscreening system using virus-like particles consisting of the VP1. Using this system, among monoclonal antibodies against the cell membrane fraction from JCV-permissive human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells, we isolated a monoclonal antibody designated as 24D2 that specifically inhibited attachment and infection of JCV to IMR-32 cells. The antibody 24D2 recognized a single molecule of around 60 kDa in molecular weight in the IMR-32 membrane fraction. Immunohistochemical staining with 24D2 demonstrated immunoreactivity in the cell membrane of JCV-permissive cell lines and glial cells of the human brain. These results suggested that the molecule recognized by 24D2 plays a role in JCV infection, and that it might participate as a receptor or a co-receptor in JCV attachment and entry into the cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
