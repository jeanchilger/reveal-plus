As infectious diseases evolve and develop resistance to existing pharmaceuticals, the marine environment provides novel leads against fungal, parasitic, bacterial, and viral diseases. Many marine natural products have successfully advanced to the late stages of clinical trials, including dolastatin 10, ecteinascidin-743, kahalalide F, and aplidine, and a growing number of candidates have been selected as promising leads for extended preclinical assessment. Although many marine-product clinical trials are for cancer chemotherapy, drug resistance, emerging infectious diseases, and the threat of bioterrorism have all contributed to the interest in assessing natural ocean products in the treatment of infectious organisms. In this review, we focus on the pharmacologically tested marine leads that have shown in-vivo efficacy or potent in-vitro activity against infectious and parasitic diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
