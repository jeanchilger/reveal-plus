We have determined the nucleotide sequence of ORF 1a, encoded within the first 13.7 kb of gene 1, for the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-AS9). Putative papain-like protease domains, a picornavirus 3C-like protease domain, two hydrophobic domains, and a domain "X" of unknown function, previously identified in other coronaviruses (1-3), are also present in ORF 1a of MHV-A59. Comparison between the ORF 1a sequence of MHV-A59 and the published sequence of the JHM strain of MHV (2) showed a high degree of similarity with the exception of several short regions. We sequenced one region of MHV-JHM that contained an 18 amino acid insertion relative to A59 and four other regions in which the sequences of the two strains differed. The MHV-2 and MHV-3 strains were else sequenced in some of these regions. Our analysis confirmed the presence of only one heterogeneous region in ORF 1a of MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM which is also present in MHV-2. Our findings indicate the need to modify the published sequence of MHV-JHM.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
