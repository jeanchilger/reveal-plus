The pronounced cytostatic activity of EAdo was confirmed. EAdo and its 2,6-diaminopurine analogue showed inhibitory activity against vaccinia virus (EC(50): 0.31 and 51 μM, respectively). Derivative 10 on the other hand was found active against varicella zoster virus (EC(50): 4.68 μM).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
