A new, reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for the rapid (within 1h), simultaneous detection of A and B group HRSV. Primers specific for groups A and B were designed to amplify the N and L genes of HRSV, respectively. A fluorescent dye, calcein, was used as an indicator for the endpoint visual detection and/or real-time amplification of HRSV RNA. The detection limit of the new method was 281.17 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml for HRSV A and 1.58 TCID50/ml for HRSV B. To evaluate the validity of this method, a comparison with RT-PCR was performed using 77 nasopharyngeal swabs as samples. Both RT-LAMP and RT-PCR detected HRSV in 38 HRSV samples, yielding a positive rate of 49%. Of the RT-LAMP positive samples, 36 (95%) were also positive by RT-PCR, while two were negative by RT-PCR. Among the 36 RT-LAMP and RT-PCR positive samples, 11 belonged to HRSV group A, while 25 belonged to group B. The results show that the new RT-LAMP is simple, rapid and well suited for HRSV diagnosis, especially in a limited-resource setting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
