There is a need for higher titers of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) vectors both for therapeutic use as well as in the manufacturing of clinical grade adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. HSV-1 yield increased when primary human fibroblasts were treated with anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone or valproic acid. In our search for compounds that would increase HSV-1 yield, we investigated another anti-inflammatory compound, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). Although ATA has been previously shown to have antiviral effects, we find that low (micromolar) concentrations of ATA increased HSV-1 vector production yields. Our results showing the use of ATA to increase HSV-1 titers have important implications for the production of certain HSV-1 vectors as well as recombinant AAV vectors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
