<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Anesthesia as a Risk for Health Care Acquired Infections</TITLE><BODY>Anesthesia is delivered in a variety of modalities including general, regional, or local. Patients are most vulnerable when receiving anesthesia, as they must depend on the anesthesia team to provide this care without untoward effects. It is expected that patients will be protected from health care acquired infections (HAIs) by appropriate use of infection prevention measures. In addition, the anesthesia team may be at risk of HAIs because of their intimate contact with the patient's blood and respiratory system. Adequate adherence to infection prevention methods should reduce the risk of occupation exposure and infection to the anesthesia team members. Health care associated infections involving anesthesia have been transmitted from health care worker to patient, patient to patient, and patient to the anesthesia provider. This article further discusses the risks for HAIs apparent in intravascular cannulation, endotracheal intubation, and the development of surgical site infections, and examines occupational measures to prevent infections in the health care worker. Regardless of the health care setting or the level of provider, the standard of care for infection prevention and managerial oversight of this care should remain the same.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
