<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-11-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral zoonoses in Europe</TITLE><BODY>Abstract A number of new virus infections have emerged or re-emerged during the past 15 years. Some viruses are spreading to new areas along with climate and environmental changes. The majority of these infections are transmitted from animals to humans, and thus called zoonoses. Zoonotic viruses are, as compared to human-only viruses, much more difficult to eradicate. Infections by several of these viruses may lead to high mortality and also attract attention because they are potential bioweapons. This review will focus on zoonotic virus infections occurring in Europe.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
