Envelope proteins are the ideal targets for antiviral strategies development due to their indispensable roles in virus entry, and inhibitory peptides targeting them have been proved to be promising in blocking virus infection. In this study, the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS) in combination with known structural data was applied to identify potential inhibitory peptides that targeted the envelope protein VP28 of WSSV. Results showed that two potential inhibitory peptides were identified, one of which exhibited not only obvious antiviral activity, but also broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The inhibitory peptide identified here can serve as a lead compound for anti-WSSV strategies development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
