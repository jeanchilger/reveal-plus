We designed and synthesized a tetraphenylethylene derivative bearing alkyne groups which were used for combination by click chemistry. The new TPE compound bearing alkyne groups was used to synthesize fluorescence oligosaccharide probes which have lactosyl and 6′-sialyllactosyl moieties as ligands. We found that the TPE compounds bearing lactosyl and 6′-sialyllactosyl moieties were useful for detection of RCA120 and SSA lectins, respectively. Moreover, we have shown that TPE-based fluorescent oligosaccharide probe bearing 6′-sialyllactose moiety can be utilized as a “turn-on” fluorescent sensor for detection of influenza virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
