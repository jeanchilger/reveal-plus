Upon adoptive transfers into these mice, MHC-restricted LCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes homed specifically to either the choroid plexus (SV40 promoter) or β cells of the islets of Langerhans (rat insulin promoter). The availability of promoters specific for neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes makes this approach compelling for evaluating T cell trafficking into the CNS and for analyzing antigen presentation in vivo in the CNS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
