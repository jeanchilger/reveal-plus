There is currently a knowledge gap on what impact restoring ecosystems has on human health. In restoring ecosystems there is a drive to restore the functionality of ecosystems rather than restoring ecosystems to ‘pristine’ condition.

Even with this uncertainty, the restoration of ecosystems for human health is still a necessity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
