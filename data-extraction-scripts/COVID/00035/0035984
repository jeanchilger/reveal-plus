An ELISA with consecutive addition of antigen and test serum to an antibody-coated plate gave higher positive: negative absorbence ratios than an ELISA in which antigen and test serum were added simultaneously. Sera collected from breeding and fattening herds in The Netherlands (n = 1313) and the F.R.G. (n = 716) were tested, and antibodies to Breda virus were demonstrated in 94% of adult cattle. Ninety percent of newborn calves had high levels of maternal antibodies, which waned until the age of 3 months. Active seroconversion occurred between 7 and 24 months in most animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
