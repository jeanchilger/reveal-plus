A fundamental characteristic of the CD8 T lymphocyte pool is that it is composed of millions of clones; each with a unique T cell receptor capable of recognizing a limited number of peptides displayed at the cell surface bound to the grooves of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. Naïve CD8 T lymphocytes are normally resting and circulate between the blood and secondary lymphoid organs in search of their cognate peptide–MHC complexes. During viral infections, bone marrow–derived professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs) in secondary lymphoid organs display viral peptides on their MHC I molecules. Specific CD8 T lymphocytes that recognize these peptide–MHC adducts become activated (primed), proliferate extensively, and develop into effectors capable of killing infected cells, identified by the presence at their surface of the pertinent viral peptide–MHC complexes. This article describes how the process of priming naïve CD8 T lymphocytes occurs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
