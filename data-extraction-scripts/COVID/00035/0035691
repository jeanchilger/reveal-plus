So far, they have essentially been selected and used on the basis of their virus-neutralizing activity and/or cell-killing activity to blunt viral propagation via direct mechanisms. There is, however, accumulating evidence that they can also induce long-lasting protective antiviral immunity by recruiting the endogenous immune system of infected individuals during the period of immunotherapy. Exploiting this property may revolutionize antiviral mAb-based immunotherapies, with benefits for both patients and healthcare systems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
