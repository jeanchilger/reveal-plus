This great movement of people has significant positive and negative consequences on nature, societies, cultures and economies. Desired worldwide for its economic benefits, tourism is anticipated to double during the next 20 years, and the multiple consequences of such rapid growth, call for a preventative approach at all strategic and professional levels, in order to avoid negative impacts. Considering mass tourism as a reality of our contemporary life that cannot be neglected by current efforts to endorse sustainable tourism, this paper draws attention to one of its key players—the tour operators—advancing the proposition that they play significant roles in affecting changes in behaviors and attitudes towards more responsible forms of tourism. Aiming to facilitate a constructive debate on the matter, the article presents a few of the most important arguments that underscore the potential that tour operators’ have in promoting sustainable tourism.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
