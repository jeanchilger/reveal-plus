We report the development of vitiligo in four patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—related conditions and in one patient with hepatitis who later developed both psoriasis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Other common features were hepatitis and multiple other viral infections. Ribavirin was associated with repigmentation in one patient. Vitiligo may be an example of an autoimmune disease triggered by viral infection in a genetically predisposed host.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
