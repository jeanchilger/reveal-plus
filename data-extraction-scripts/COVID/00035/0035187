Cases included eight cats with feline infectious peritonitis and two cats with toxoplasmosis. Abnormalities affecting the CNS were observed in MR images in 10 (71%) cats. Intracranial lesions appeared as slightly hypointense foci in T1-weighted images in two (14%) cats, as hyperintense foci in T2-weighted images in seven (50%) cats and as hyperintense foci after intravenous administration of a gadolinium-based contrast medium in 10 (71%) cats. In six cats with lesions in T1- and/or T2-weighted images, additional lesions were visible in T1-weighted images obtained after gadolinium-based contrast medium administration. In three cats, lesions were visible only after contrast medium administration. In our study, MR imaging (MRI) did not appear to detect all cases of CNS inflammation in the population of cats with inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, MRI adds information about the sites and morphology of intracranial lesions that should help to distinguish between neoplasia and inflammatory conditions and, possibly, between different inflammatory conditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
