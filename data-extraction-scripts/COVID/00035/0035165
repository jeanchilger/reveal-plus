We report a monoclonal antibody (FVM04) that targets a uniquely exposed epitope within the RBS, cross-neutralizes Ebola (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), and to a lesser extent Bundibugyo viruses, and shows protection against EBOV and SUDV in mice and guinea pigs. The antibody cocktail ZMapp™, is remarkably effective against EBOV (Zaire), but does not cross-neutralize other ebolaviruses. By replacing one of the ZMapp™ components with FVM04, we retained the anti-EBOV efficacy while extending the breadth of protection to SUDV, thereby generating a cross protective antibody cocktail. In addition, we report several mutations at the base of the ebolavirus glycoprotein that enhance the binding of FVM04 and other cross-reactive antibodies. These findings have important implications for pan-ebolavirus vaccine development and defining broadly protective antibody cocktails.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
