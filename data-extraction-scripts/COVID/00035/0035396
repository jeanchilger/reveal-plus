We generated a SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein-expressing recombinant vaccinia virus (RVV-S) using highly attenuated strain LC16m8. Intradermal administration of RVV-S into rabbits induced neutralizing (NT) antibodies against SARS-CoV 1 week after administration and the NT titer reached 1:1000 after boost immunization with RVV-S. Significantly, NT antibodies against SARS-CoV were induced by administration of RVV-S to rabbits that had been pre-immunized with LC16m8. RVV-S can induce NT antibodies against SARS-CoV despite the presence of NT antibodies against VV. These results suggest that RVV-S may be a powerful SARS vaccine, including in patients previously immunized with the smallpox vaccine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
