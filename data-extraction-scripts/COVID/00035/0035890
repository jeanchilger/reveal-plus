The activity of the prodrugs was evaluated in vitro against different virus families. Whereas ester derivatives of PEEHx and (S)-HPMPHx were antivirally inactive, monoesters of PEEG, and mono- and diesters of (S)-HPMPG showed pronounced antiviral activity against vaccinia virus and/or herpesviruses. Monoesters of (S)-HPMPG emerged as the most potent and selective derivatives against these DNA viruses. None of the compounds were inhibitory against RNA viruses and retroviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
