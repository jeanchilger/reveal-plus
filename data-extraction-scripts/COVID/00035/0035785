A total of 372 tissues or serum samples collected from pigs distributed in 9 provinces/municipalities of China during the period from February 2011 to November 2012 were assayed for T. gondii antigens and antibodies using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, while the PCR was designed for the detection of the PRRSV, CSFV and PCV-2, respectively. The total positive rate of T. gondii, PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2 was 9.14% (34/372), 50.00% (186/372), 37.10% (138/372) and 3.23% (12/372), respectively. Among the 34 T. gondii positive samples, 26 samples were simultaneously infected with T. gondii and viruses, while the remaining eight samples were infected with T. gondii alone. In addition, the co-infection rate of T. gondii with PRSSV, T. gondii with PRSSV and CSFV, T. gondii with PRSSV and PCV-2, T. gondii with CSFV and PCV-2, T. gondii with PRSSV, CSFV and PCV-2 was 1.61% (6/372), 4.03% (15/372), 0.27% (1/372), 0.27% (1/372) and 0.81% (3/372), respectively. The results of the present survey revealed that PRRSV and CSFV were the common pathogens co-existing with porcine toxoplasmosis in China, and both of them could increase the chances of T. gondii infection in pig. This is the first report of T. gondii co-infections with viruses in pigs. It is very important to understand the interactions of parasite and virus, and can be used as reference data for the control and prevention of co-infections of T. gondii and viruses in pigs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
