<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-11-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Gene–Environment Interactions: Eco-Genetics and Toxicogenomics</TITLE><BODY>Gene–environment interactions likely account for a large portion of the “missing heritability” or “dark matter” of genetic associations with traits and diseases. In concert with the powerful methods and scale of genomic population analyses, a complementary effort is needed to capture data about behavioral and environmental variables acting on the genetic substrate and contributing importantly to disease risk. Examples from environmental exposures to foods and food additives, infectious agents, inhaled pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, sensory stimuli, and allergic and sensitizing agents are summarized. Epigenomics and protein folding/misfolding are recently recognized mechanisms for some of these interactions and effects.
