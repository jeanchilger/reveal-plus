In many situations, composite nonwovens might fulfill multiple objectives. Applications of composite nonwovens are quite diverse and increasing in the area of air, liquid and engine filtration. The developmental objectives of composite filtering media are lower energy consumption, longer filter life, high filtration capacity, greater dust holding (in depth filtration) and easy cleanability (of surface filter), satisfying more than one functional requirement and easier maintenance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
