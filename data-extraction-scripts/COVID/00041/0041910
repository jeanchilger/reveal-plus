Most of the existing studies assumed that all infected individuals can transmit disease- related information or can be perceived by their neighbors. However, owing to lack of distinct symptoms for patients in the initial stage of infection, the disease information cannot be transmitted in the population, which may lead to the wrong perception of infection risk and inappropriate behavior response. In this work, we divide infected individuals into Exposed-state (without obvious clinical symptoms) individuals and Infected-state (with evident clinical symptoms) individuals, both of whom can spread disease, but only Infected-state individuals can diffuse disease information. Then, in this work we establish UAU-SEIS (Unaware–Aware–Unaware–Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Susceptible) model in multiplex networks and analyze the effect of asymptomatic infection and the isolation of Infected-state individuals on the density of infection and the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, we extend the UAU-SEIS model by taking the individual heterogeneity into consideration. Combined Markov chain approach and Monte-Carlo Simulations, we find that asymptomatic infection has an effect on the density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold, and the extent of the effect is influenced by whether Infected-state individuals are isolated or treated. In addition, results show that the individual heterogeneity can lower the density of infected individuals, but cannot enhance the epidemic threshold.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
