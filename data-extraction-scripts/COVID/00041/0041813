While most adopted children will have common illnesses, others may have unique medical issues as a result of the conditions in their birth country requiring a broadened differential diagnosis. Knowledge of these issues is essential in the management of these patients. This review will predominately focus on infectious disease issues commonly seen in international adoptees but will also discuss other medical conditions and some of the psychosocial issues which may be encountered by caregivers in the emergency department.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
