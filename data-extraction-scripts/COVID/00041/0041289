METHODS: The syntheses of complexes of coumarin analogues were accomplished by mixing a hydro-alcoholic solution of 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues with transition metal chlorides. The structural environment of the synthesized molecules was characterized using different instrumental methods. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by the agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: The cobalt complexes of (E)-3-((4-chlorophenyl) diazenyl)-4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one (HL(1)): (4a) and (E)-3-((4-methoxyphenyl) diazenyl)-4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one (HL(2)): (4e) showed excellent antimicrobial activities compared with their ligands. CONCLUSION: The reports of the antimicrobial investigation showed that the cobalt complexes of 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues exhibited potential antimicrobial activity that was stronger than that of their ligands.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
