This assay measures the initial enzyme activity rate during the first minute of the reaction, which ensures linear velocity relative to time and a progress curve slope proportional to analyte concentration. During this period, the enzyme substrate is in large excess relative to the analyte/antibody-enzyme complex, and enzyme catalysis proceeds in steady-state conditions. Analyses of repeatability gave coefficients of variation between 4.4 and 9.7 (interassay) and 4.4 and 6.4 (intra-assay), and analyte detectability ranged from 5.8 to 12 ng/ml. The Z-factor calculated for analyte samples at their end dilution yielded mean values from 0.57 to 0.87, which confirmed assay robustness. This initial velocity-based sandwich ELISA is a simple, sensitive, reproducible method to quantitate bi-epitopic antigens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
