The ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine were found to have different levels of antioxidant properties in the test models. Both ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) (0.5–2.5 mg/ml) and lycorine (0.010 mg–0.050 mg/ml) increases the percentage of lipid peroxidation inhibition (26.25 ± 0.23% and 19.25 ± 0.23%) and enhances the free radical scavenging activity (20.92 ± 0.22% and 20.52 ± 0.22%), scavenging of hydrogen peroxide (25.67 ± 0.17% and 23.07 ± 0.3%) superoxide anion scavenging activity (27.69 ± 0.16% and 16.09 ± 0.7%) at concentration of 2.5 and 0.050 mg of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine, respectively. But compared with tocopherol (P < 0.05) less activity was observed by C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine. The ethanolic extract of C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine were normalized to reduce the level of glutathione and also to sustain the status of protein in erythrocytes during the peroxyl radical [2,2-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)] induced oxidative damage in ex vivo model. The present results of the investigations demonstrated that protective nature of the C. asiaticum (L) and lycorine will be considered as a significant natural antioxidant source.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
