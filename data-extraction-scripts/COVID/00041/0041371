Objective : The present report analyse the discrepant results that could be obtained by the commercially available diagnostic tests and that can mask the reliable viral diagnosis. Study design : One fecal sample was collected from a hospitalized child aged 6 months with acute watery diarrhea and dehydration. The fecal specimen was processed the same day for the rotavirus and adenovirus antigen detection. Results : The sample was positive for rotavirus antigen by one-step membrane test based on immunochromatographic assays (ICA) and enzyme immunoassays (EIA) monoclonal test but it was negative by an EIA polyclonal test, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and RT-PCR assays. In the other hand, the sample was positive for adenovirus antigen by ICA and EIA adenovirus type 40/41. Finally, the sample showed by PAGE an electrophoretic profile resembled that of reovirus. Conclusion : The use of a wide repertory of diagnosis tests allowed to reach an unusual reovirus–adenovirus type 40/41 dual infection. This case also point out the potential participation of reovirus in the ethiology of the diarrhea illness.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
