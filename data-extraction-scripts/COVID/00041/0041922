Our objective was to develop a cell culture system to grow HRV-C. Epithelial cells from human sinuses (HSEC) were differentiated at air–liquid interface (ALI). Differentiated cultures supported 1–2 logs growth of HRV-C15 as detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Two distinguishing features of HRVs are acid lability and optimal growth at 33–34 °C. We used this system to show that HRV-C15 is neutralized by low pH (4.5). In contrast to most HRV types, replication of HRV-C15 and HRV-C41 was similar at 34 and 37°C. The HSEC ALI provides a useful tool for quantitative studies of HRV-C replication. The ability of HRV-C to grow equally well at 34°C and 37°C may contribute to the propensity for HRV-C to cause lower airway illnesses in infants and children with asthma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
