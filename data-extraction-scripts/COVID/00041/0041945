<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-12-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Coronavirus non-structural protein 16: Evasion, attenuation, and possible treatments</TITLE><BODY>The recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), nearly a decade after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, highlights the importance of understanding and developing therapeutic treatment for current and emergent CoVs. This manuscript explores the role of NSP16, a 2′O-methyl-transferase (2′O-MTase), in CoV infection and the host immune response. The review highlights conserved motifs, required interaction partners, as well as the attenuation of NSP16 mutants, and restoration of these mutants in specific immune knockouts. Importantly, the work also identifies a number of approaches to exploit this understanding for therapeutic treatment and the data clearly illustrate the importance of NSP16 2′O-MTase activity for CoV infection and pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
