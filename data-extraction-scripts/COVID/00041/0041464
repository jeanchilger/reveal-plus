The potential to control oral biofilms through the use of nanoparticles, classified as particles having a size no greater than 100nm, is reviewed in this chapter. Exploitation of the toxic properties of nanoparticles to bacteria, viruses, and fungi, in particular metals and metal oxides and their incorporation into other materials has increased markedly over the past decade. The potential of nanoparticles to control the formation of biofilms within the oral cavity, as a function of their antimicrobial, antiadhesive, and delivery capabilities, is now coming under close scrutiny. Formulation of materials at the nanoscale range does require novel physicochemical and technological approaches.
