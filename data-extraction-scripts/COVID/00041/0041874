Effectiveness of loaded sit-to-stand resistance exercise for children with mild spastic diplegia: a randomized clinical trial. Objective To investigate effectiveness of a functional strengthening program, the loaded sit-to-stand (STS) resistance exercise, for children with cerebral palsy (CP). Design A single-blind, randomized block design. Setting STS exercises were carried out at the children’s homes. Participants Twenty children (12 boys, 8 girls; age range, 5−12y) with spastic diplegia CP and classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification System as level I or II were stratified by their severity and age and randomly allocated into either the experimental or control group. Intervention Both groups received their regular physical therapy. The experimental group underwent loaded STS exercise 3 times a week for 6 weeks. Main Outcome Measures Goal dimension scores of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), gait speed, 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) of the loaded STS, isometric strength of knee extensor, and Physiological Cost Index (PCI). The outcome measures were conducted at the beginning and end of the 6-week study. Results After loaded STS exercise, the experimental group showed statistically significant differences in GMFM goal dimension scores, 1-RM STS, and PCI from the control group. The changes in gait speed and isometric strength of the knee extensor did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Conclusions After the loaded STS exercise, children with mild spastic diplegia improved their basic motor abilities, functional muscle strength, and walking efficiency.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
