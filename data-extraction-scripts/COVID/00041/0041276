Groups 1, 2 and 3, twice a day, were administered chitosan oligosaccharide at a dose of 100, 500, and 1000 mg/kg for 7 days, respectively, with milk replacer. In group 4, lambs with cryptosporidiosis were subjected to normal feeding as control without drug administration. Clinical examinations of lambs were made before treatment (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after treatment and 5 ml of blood was collected from vena jugularis for blood analysis of all lambs. Weight changes of lambs were recorded at 0, 7, 14, and 21 days. Stool specimens were collected pre-treatment (day 0) and on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 post-treatment to determine oocyst excretion of lambs with cryptosporidiosis. Lambs with a mean oocyte counts >10 after stool examination were included to the treatment. Changes in clinical hematology, blood gases and biochemical parameters were observed during the course of treatment, but these changes were limited. Weight loss was observed at 7th day according to 0th day the lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis but gradually weight increase was observed at 14th and 21st days and these changes were similar in all groups. Oocyst excretion decreased in all groups during treatment. According to 0th day, there was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in oocyte excretions in the third day in group 1 and 2, and in day 5 in the group 3 and 4. Significant changes (p < 0.05) were observed in oocyst excretions on the third and fifth days among the groups. As a result, in lambs with experimental cryptosporidiosis, chitosan oligosaccharide improved in clinical signs and stool character shorter than the positive control group and the administration of chitosan oligosaccharide at doses of 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg for 7 days significantly reduced oocyst excretion but not enough to remove cryptosporidiosis completely.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
