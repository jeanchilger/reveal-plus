Addition of ligand oxides (LO) causes a red shift in the λ(max) values of oxo(salen) complexes and an increase in absorbance with the concentration of LO along with a clear isobestic point. The reaction shows first-order dependence on oxo(salen)-chromium(V)(+) ion and fractional-order dependence on PSAA and ligand oxide. Michaelis–Menten kinetics without kinetic saturation was observed for the reaction. The order of reactivity among the ligand oxides is picoline N-oxide > pyridine N-oxide > triphenylphosphine oxide. The low catalytic activity of TPPO was rationalized. Both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents in the phenyl ring of PSAA facilitate the reaction rate. The Hammett plots are non-linear upward type with negative ρ value for electron-donating substituents, (ρ(−) = −0.740 to −4.10) and positive ρ value for electron-withdrawing substituents (ρ(+) = +0.057 to +0.886). Non-linear Hammett plot is explained by two possible mechanistic scenarios, electrophilic and nucleophilic attack of oxo(salen)chromium(V)(+)-LO adduct on PSAA as the substituent in PSAA is changed from electron-donating to electron-withdrawing. The linearity in the log k vs. E(ox) plot confirms single-electron transfer (SET) mechanism for PSAAs with electron-donating substituents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
