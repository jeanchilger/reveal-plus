Polyclonal antibody preparations are increasingly being replaced by highly potent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Cocktails of mAbs and bispecific constructs can be used to simultaneously target multiple viral epitopes and to overcome issues of neutralization escape. Advances in antibody engineering have led to a large array of novel mAb formats, while deeper insight into the biology of several viruses and increasing knowledge of their neutralizing epitopes has extended the list of potential targets. In addition, progress in developing inexpensive production platforms will make antiviral mAbs more widely available and affordable.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
