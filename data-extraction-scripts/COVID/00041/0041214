It has the advantages of fast analysis, high sensitivity, high resolution and low-cost of samples. Plastic chip has the potential of mass production for clinical use for its advantages in biocompatibility and low cost. In this work, the method for fabrication of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) chip was described, and conditions for DNA separation were investigated with the chip. The PMMA microchip was used for detection of multiplex PCR products of 18 and 36 cases with SARS and hepatitis B virus infection under optimized separation conditions. Microchip electrophoresis showed higher sensitivity, higher resolution and less time consumption when compared with gel electrophoresis. The microchip electrophoresis with PMMA chip provided a rapid, sensitive and reliable method for analysis of multiplex PCR products.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
