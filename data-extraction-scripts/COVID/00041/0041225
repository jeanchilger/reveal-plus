Maximin H6, which is found in skin secretions of frogs of the Bombinae family, attacks gram-negative bacteria and acts haemolytically. While the peptide spontaneously folds into similar structures in both neutral dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) and negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles, its structure is more flexible in SDS as shown by (15)N relaxation measurements. In addition, it is bound closer to the surface of the micelle and rotated by ∼70° around its helix axis in the negatively charged membrane surrogate compared to the structure in DPC. This might form the basis for peptide–peptide interactions through a GxxxG motif, which could finally lead to membrane disruption and, thus, preferential attack of negatively charged microbial cell walls.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
