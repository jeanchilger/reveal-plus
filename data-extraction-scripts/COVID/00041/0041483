HMPV has worldwide prevalence, and is a leading cause of respiratory tract infection in the first years of life, with a spectrum of disease similar to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The disease burden associated with HMPV infection has not been fully elucidated; however, studies indicate that HMPV may cause upper or lower respiratory tract illness in patients between ages 2 months and 87 years, may co-circulate with RSV, and HMPV infection may be associated with asthma exacerbation. The mechanisms and effector pathways contributing to immunity or disease pathogenesis following infection are not fully understood; however, given the clinical significance of HMPV, there is a need for a fundamental understanding of the immune and pathophysiological processes that occur following infection to provide the foundation necessary for the development of effective vaccine or therapeutic intervention strategies. This review provides a current perspective on the processes associated with HMPV infection, immunity, and disease pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
