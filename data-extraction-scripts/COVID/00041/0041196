The universal primers and specific TaqMan probes for each of the three genotypes, genotypes 1, 2, and 3, were designed within the 3′-UTR of the CSFV. Non-CSFV swine virus and clinical samples from specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were both demonstrated to be CSFV-negative by RT-MRT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was determined to be 1 viral copy/μl for each genotype of standard plasmid. For the analytical sensitivity experiment, 100 samples of 14 CSFV genotype 1 strains and 86 samples from CSFV outbreak farms were all detected as CSFV-positive by RT-MRT-PCR, and the genotype results were consistent with the results of sequencing from a previous study. The intra-assay and inter-assay variations of RT-MRT-PCR were below 3% in all experiments. The sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was the same as the reverse transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) and higher than reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and viral isolation from clinical samples. This assay was used further to evaluate the duration of viremia of wild-type CSFV in vaccinated exposed pigs. The results indicated that pigs vaccinated with the E2 subunit vaccine had longer viremia than pigs given the C-strain vaccine, which is compatible with the findings of previous studies. Thus, the new RT-MRT-PCR is a rapid, reproducible, sensitive, and specific genotyping tool for CSFV detection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
