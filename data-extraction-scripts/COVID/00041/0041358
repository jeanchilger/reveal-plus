Objectives To describe post-mortem combined histological and tissue molecular biological techniques for the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and varicella zoster virus co-infection as a cause of death. Study design Real-time quantitative PCR and RT-PCR assays for Herpesviruses, respiratory viruses, Adenovirus, Enterovirus and Parvovirus B19 were performed on multi-organ frozen samples and paraffin-embedded tissues in combination with histology. Results Cytomegalovirus and varicella zoster virus were detected by molecular biology with highest viral loads detected in the lungs (4.6×107 and 1.9×105 genome copies per million of cells, respectively). Pulmonary extensive necrotizing inflammation and immunohistochemistry correlated to virological data. Virological molecular biology was negative on paraffin-embedded tissues. Conclusions This case shows that thorough quantitative virological investigations on frozen tissues must be performed in combination with histology and immunohistochemistry for the determination of the cause of a sudden unexplained infant death.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
