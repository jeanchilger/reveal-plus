Influenza and parainfluenza viruses, syncytial respiratory virus, herpes viruses and adenovirures are the most frequent causes of these severe infections. A review of the literature has been performed in order to update the epidemiology, pathogenesis and therapeutic approach of viral infections affecting immunocompetent patients. Furthermore, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent nosocomial infection in intensive care units and has a high morbidity and mortality rate. It is mainly a bacterial disease, although the potential role of viruses as pathogens or copathogens in VAP is under discussion. Therefore, a brief review of the potential pathogenic role of viruses in VAP has also been performed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
