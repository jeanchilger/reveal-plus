This fatal disease is caused by JE Virus (JEV). The current study was carried out for designing a multi-epitope loaded peptide vaccine to prevent JEV. Based on reverse vaccinology and in silico approaches, octapeptide B-cell and hexapeptide T-cell epitopes belonging to five proteins, viz. E, prM, NS1, NS3 and NS5 of JEV were determined. Hydrophilicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity and aliphatic amino acids of the epitopes were estimated. Further, the epitopes were analyzed for different physicochemical parameters, e.g. total net charges, amino acid composition and Boman index. Out of all the epitopes, a total of four T-cell epitopes namely KRADSS, KRSRRS, SKRSRR and KECPDE and one B-cell epitope i.e. PKPCSKGD were found to have potential for raising immunity in human against the pathogen. Taking into account the outcome of this study, the pharmaceutical industries could initiate efforts to combine the identified epitopes together with adjuvant or carrier protein to develop a multi-epitope-loaded peptide vaccine against JEV. The peptide vaccine, being cost effective, could be administered as a prophylactic measure and in JEV infected individuals to combat the spread of this virus in human population. However, prior to administration into human beings, the vaccine must pass through several clinical trials.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
