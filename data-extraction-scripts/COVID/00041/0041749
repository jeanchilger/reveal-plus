The efficacy of parenteral administration of widely used modified live virus PRRS vaccine (PRRS-MLV) against genetically divergent PRRSV strains remains questionable. Therefore, we evaluated an alternate and proven mucosal immunization approach by intranasal delivery of PRRS-MLV (strain VR2332) with a potent adjuvant to elicit cross-protective immunity against a heterologous PRRSV (strain MN184). Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate (Mtb WCL) was chosen as a potent mucosal adjuvant due to its Th1 biased immune response to PRRS-MLV. Unvaccinated pigs challenged with MN184 had clinical PRRS with severe lung pathology; however, vaccinated (PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL) pigs challenged with MN184 were apparently healthy. There was a significant increase in the body weight gain in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated PRRSV challenged pigs. Vaccinated compared to unvaccinated, virus-challenged pigs had reduced lung pathology associated with enhanced PRRSV neutralizing antibody titers and reduced viremia. Immunologically, an increased frequency of Th cells, Th/memory cells, γδ T cells, dendritic cells, and activated Th cells and a reduced frequency of T-regulatory cells were detected at both mucosal and systemic sites. Further, reduced secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) and upregulation of the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ in blood and lungs were detected in mucosally vaccinated, PRRSV-challenged pigs. In conclusion, intranasal immunization of pigs with PRRS-MLV administered with Mtb WCL generated effective cross-protective immunity against PRRSV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
