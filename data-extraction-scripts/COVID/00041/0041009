The low inter-assay coefficient of variation recorded demonstrated that this method is highly repeatable. Compared with SPF cats, cytokine production was upregulated in most of the samples from FCoV-positive non-symptomatic cats. The appearance of a case of FIP in the cattery was associated with an increased expression of cytokines, in particular there was an increased production of IL-1β and IFN-γ, suggesting that these cytokines might protect infected cats from the disease. This hypothesis was also supported by the low levels of IFN-γ recorded in blood from cats with FIP.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
