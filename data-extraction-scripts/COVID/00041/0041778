Since current options for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections are limited, there is an essential need for the development of effective therapies against HIV/HBV co-infections. RNA interference (RNAi) has been used as a powerful tool to silence genes in cells and animals. In this study, we developed a small interfering RNA generation system that expressed two different siRNAs to target the HBs gene of HBV and the gp120 gene of HIV in Bel-7402 and HEK293T cells, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the two siRNA molecules could simultaneously inhibit the expression of HBs and gp120 by 81% and 89%, respectively. In addition, dual siRNA molecules significantly decreased the production of HBs, and simultaneously inhibited the replication of HBV and HIV. This dual siRNA generation system not only proved to be a novel approach for studying functions of multiple genes simultaneously, but also provides a potential approach for the treatment and prevention of HIV and HBV co-infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
