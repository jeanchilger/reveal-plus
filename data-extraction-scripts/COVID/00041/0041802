However, CPs have additional and important roles in the virus infection cycles and in the cellular responses to infection. These activities involve CP binding to RNAs in both sequence-specific and nonspecific manners as well as association with other proteins. This review focuses on CPs of both plant and animal-infecting viruses with positive-strand RNA genomes. We summarize the structural features of CPs and describe their modulatory roles in viral translation, RNA-dependent RNA synthesis, and host defense responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
