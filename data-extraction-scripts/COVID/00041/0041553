In this report the first successful isolation of CRCoV from a dog with respiratory disease is described. The isolate CRCoV-4182 was cultured in HRT-18 cells but failed to replicate in a number of other cell lines. The nucleotide sequence of the 3′-terminal portion of the CRCoV genome was determined including all open reading frames from the NS2 gene to the N gene. Comparison with other coronavirus sequences showed a high similarity to bovine coronavirus (BCoV). The region between the spike and the E gene was found to be the most variable and was used for phylogenetic analysis of several CRCoV strains. CRCoV-4182 showed a mutation within the non-structural protein region downstream of the S gene leading to the translation of an 8.8kDa putative protein comprising a fusion of the equivalent of the BCoV 4.9kDa protein to a truncated version of the BCoV 4.8kDa protein. The culture of CRCoV will enable analysis of the expression and function of this and other CRCoV proteins as well as allowing the study of the role of CRCoV in the aetiology of canine infectious respiratory disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
