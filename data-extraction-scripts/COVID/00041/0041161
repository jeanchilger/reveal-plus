Description Logics (DLs) are suitable, well-known logics for managing structured knowledge that have gained considerable attention the last decade. The current research progress and the existing problems of uncertain or imprecise knowledge representation and reasoning in DLs are analyzed in this paper. An integration between the theories of fuzzy DLs and rough DLs has been attempted by providing fuzzy rough DLs based on fuzzy rough set theory. The syntax, semantics and properties of fuzzy rough DLs are given. It is proved that the satisfiability, subsumption, entailment and ABox consistency reasoning in fuzzy rough DLs may be reduced to the ABox consistency reasoning in the corresponding fuzzy DLs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
