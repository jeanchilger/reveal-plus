There are now thought to be four major subclassifications of gastroenteritis-causing viruses; these include rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, including Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses, and astrovirus. The association of these agents with gastroenteritis has been made by their electron microscopic detection in stool and intestinal biopsy specimens from affected patients, the inability to detect the viruses after recovery from disease, and the subsequent development of immunoglobulin responses after infection; in some instances disease transmission was achieved in human volunteers. The association of these viral agents with gastroenteritis has facilitated the study of classification, epidemiology, immunity, diagnostic tests, methods of treatment and, most importantly, disease prevention strategies such as vaccine development for rotavirus. This chapter highlights the major features of these agents, with special attention being given to the pertinent molecular biology as well as current and future prospects for vaccination. Enteric viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with AIDS are also discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
