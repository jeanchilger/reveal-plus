Since experimentation is far easier in vitro, researchers have been sought to develop in vitro assays that are expected to predict activity in vivo. This could be important in both vaccine design and in passive antibody administration. The proposed mechanisms of in vitro neutralization range from those requiring binding of a single antibody molecule to virus to those requiring substantially complete antibody coating of virus. In vitro, antiviral activity can be separated into activity against virions and activity against infected cells. The activity against virions most often considered is neutralization that can be defined as the loss of infectivity, which ensues when antibody molecule(s) bind to a virus particle, and occurs without the involvement of any other agency. In vivo, it is conventional to distinguish phenomenologically between two types of antibody antiviral activity. One of them is the ability of antibody to protect against infection when it is present before or immediately following infection. Evidence for a number of viruses in vitro indicates that lower antibody concentrations are required to inhibit infection propagated by free virus than are required to inhibit infection propagated by cell-to-cell spread.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
