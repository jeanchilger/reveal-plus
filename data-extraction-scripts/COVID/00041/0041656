<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-05-13</DATELINE><TITLE>PNEUMONIA | Atypical</TITLE><BODY>‘Atypical pneumonia’ refers to a clinical syndrome associated with pneumonia (typically mild, nonlobar) and diverse upper respiratory tract and extrapulmonary manifestations. Clinical features overlap with bacterial pneumonia, and co-infection with both typical (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae or other bacteria) and atypical pathogens may occur. ‘Atypical’ pathogens include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella spp. In large epidemiological studies, Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been implicated in 2–18% of community-acquired pneumonias; Chlamydia pneumoniae, in 2–8%; Legionella sp., 1–4%. Atypical pathogens lack cell walls and are resistant to β-lactam antibiotics but are usually susceptible to tetracyclines, macrolides, ketolides, and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In this article, we also review other unusual causes of pneumonia which are transmitted by insects or vectors (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever, cat scratch fever, Q fever, ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and tularemia). These diverse organisms are not found on Gram stain, and diagnosis requires special culture techniques or serological assays. We review the salient clinical and laboratory features of these various disorders, and discuss diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
