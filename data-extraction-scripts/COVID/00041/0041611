Consequently, this has created an exigency in the search for new drugs with improved clinical utility or means of potentiating available ones. To this end, accumulating empirical evidence supports molecular target therapy as a plausible egress and, β-glucuronidase (βGLU) – a lysosomal acid hydrolase responsible for the catalytic deconjugation of β-d-glucuronides has emerged as a viable molecular target for several therapeutic applications. The enzyme’s activity level in body fluids is also deemed a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of some pathological conditions. Moreover, due to its role in colon carcinogenesis and certain drug-induced dose-limiting toxicities, the development of potent inhibitors of βGLU in human intestinal microbiota has aroused increased attention over the years. Nevertheless, although our literature survey revealed both natural products and synthetic scaffolds as potential inhibitors of the enzyme, only few of these have found clinical utility, albeit with moderate to poor pharmacokinetic profile. Hence, in this review we present a compendium of exploits in the present millennium directed towards the inhibition of βGLU. The aim is to proffer a platform on which new scaffolds can be modelled for improved βGLU inhibitory potency and the development of new therapeutic agents in consequential.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
