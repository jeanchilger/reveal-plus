Methods Fifty general ICU survivors (ventilated for ≥5 days) performed a maximal cycle ergometer CPET within 6 weeks of hospital discharge. Health-related quality of life was measured by the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 version 2.0 questionnaire. Results Fifty patients (median age, 57 years; median Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 16) completed a CPET 24 ± 14 days after hospital discharge with no adverse events. Significant exercise limitation was present with peak Vo 2 56% ± 16% predicted and anaerobic threshold (AT) 41% ± 13% of peak predicted Vo 2. Prospectively stratified subgroup comparison showed that patients ventilated for 14 days or more had a significantly lower AT and peak Vo 2 than those ventilated for 5 to 14 days (AT: 9.6 vs 11.7 mL/kg per minute O2, P = .009; peak Vo 2: 12.9 vs 15.3 mL/kg per minute O2, P = .022). At peak exercise, heart rate reserve was 25% ± 14%, breathing reserve was 47% ± 19%, and the respiratory exchange ratio was 0.96 ± 0.11. Ventilatory equivalents for CO2 (Eqco 2) were 39 ± 9. Conclusions Significant exercise limitation is evident in patients who have had critical illness. Etiology of exercise limitation appears multifactorial, with general deconditioning and muscle weakness as major contributory factors. Early CPET appears a practical method of assessing exercise capacity in ICU survivors. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing could be used to select patients who may benefit most from a targeted physical rehabilitation program, aid in exercise prescription, and help assess the response to intervention.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
