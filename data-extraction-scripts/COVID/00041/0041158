<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-09-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Biomarkers for Late-Onset Neonatal Sepsis: Cytokines and Beyond</TITLE><BODY>Acute phase reactants, pro and antiinflammatory mediators including chemokines and cytokines, and cell-surface antigens are nonspecific biomarkers that have been extensively studied for the diagnosis and management of late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) and necrotizing enterocolitis. It is expected that the next generation of biomarkers and tests will be more specific, will pinpoint the precise disease entity, and will provide crucial information on the exact pathogen or category of microorganism and its antibiotic profile within hours of clinical presentation. Research on molecular pathogen detection and proteomic profiling has shown promising results. Academic-industry partnerships are vital for successful development of new diagnostic biomarkers for LONS, which are sensitive, inexpensive, fully automated, and easy to measure, allowing a quick turnaround time for clinical decision making.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
