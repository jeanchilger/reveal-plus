Calves were divided into 2 groups: COL + (n = 10) received fresh colostrum; and COL − (n = 10) which received frozen colostrum containing no viable cells. The calves were assessed before colostrum intake (D0), 48 h of age (D2), and weekly from D7 up to D28. Blood samples were collected for analysis of the distribution of leukocytes, cellular phenotype and in vitro granulocyte function. COL + calves tended to have a high number of neutrophils on D7 (p = 0.073). COL − calves took up significantly more Escherichia coli (measured as MFI) on D7 (p = 0.034). Endogenous production of radicals (as percentage of cells) tended to be higher in COL − calves on D14 (p = 0.061). The intensity of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by granulocytes tended to be higher in COL + calves on D21 (p = 0.094). Overall, ROS production (percent of cells, and MFI) induced by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were higher in COL + calves than COL − calves. It was our observation that COL + calves developed an innate immune response more quickly and efficiently after natural exposure to pathogens after birth. In contrast, COL − calves mounted an innate response more slowly that yielded a persistent inflammatory response after natural exposure to these bacteria agents. This research provides evidence of an advantage to the calf of receiving fresh colostrum on the development and function of the innate immune system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
