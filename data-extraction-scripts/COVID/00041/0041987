Although endogenous mRNA is also 5′-triphosphorylated, backbone modifications and the 5′-ppp-linked methylguanosine ((m7)G) cap prevent immunorecognition. Here we show that the methylation status of endogenous capped mRNA at the 5′-terminal nucleotide (N(1)) was crucial to prevent RIG-I activation. Moreover, we identified a single conserved amino acid (H830) in the RIG-I RNA binding pocket as the mediator of steric exclusion of N(1)-2′O-methylated RNA. H830A alteration (RIG-I(H830A)) restored binding of N(1)-2′O-methylated pppRNA. Consequently, endogenous mRNA activated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not wild-type RIG-I. Similarly, knockdown of the endogenous N(1)-2′O-methyltransferase led to considerable RIG-I stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Studies involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2′O-methyltransferase and RIG-I(H830A) revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape RIG-I. Our data reveal a new role for cap N(1)-2′O-methylation in RIG-I tolerance of self-RNA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
