Adenoviruses express high amounts of non-coding virus associated (VA) RNAs able to saturate key factors of the RNA interference (RNAi) processing pathway, such as Exportin 5 and Dicer. Furthermore, a proportion of VA RNAs is cleaved by Dicer into viral microRNAs (mivaRNAs) that can saturate Argonaute, an essential protein for miRNA function. Thus, processing and function of cellular miRNAs is blocked in adenoviral-infected cells. However, viral miRNAs actively target the expression of cellular genes involved in relevant functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair or RNA regulation. Interestingly, the cellular silencing machinery is active at early times post-infection and can be used to control the adenovirus cell cycle. This is relevant for therapeutic purposes against adenoviral infections or when recombinant adenoviruses are used as vectors for gene therapy. Manipulation of the viral genome allows the use of adenoviral vectors to express therapeutic miRNAs or to be silenced by the RNAi machinery leading to safer vectors with a specific tropism.
