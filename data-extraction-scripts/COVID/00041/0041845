Because of its significance in immune response, JAK-STAT pathway is often targeted by pathogens, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). PRRSV causes reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease in pigs of all ages. A typical feature of the immune response to PRRSV infection in pigs is delayed production and low titer of virus neutralizing antibodies, and weak cell-mediated immune response. One of the possible reasons for the weak protective immune response is that PRRSV interferes with cytokine-mediated JAK-STAT signaling. PRRSV inhibits interferon-activated JAK-STAT signaling by blocking nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. The mechanism is that PRRSV non-structural protein 1β (nsp1β) induces degradation of karyopherin α1 (KPNA1), a critical adaptor in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. PRRSV also antagonizes IL6-activated JAK-STAT3 signaling via inducing degradation of STAT3. In this review, we briefly introduce JAK-STAT signaling, summarize the PRRSV interference with it, and provide perspective on the perturbation in the context of PRRSV-elicited immune response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
