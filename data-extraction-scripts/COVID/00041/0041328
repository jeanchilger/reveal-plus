We previously cloned and characterized a novel jacalin-like lectin gene (Ta-JA1) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which codes a modular JRP with disease response and jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domains and is present only in the Gramineae family. The function of this protein is still unclear. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Ta-JA1 and related proteins from cereals grouped together, which diverged from JRL with an additional N-terminal disease response domain. The recombinant Ta-JA1 proteins agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes, and this hemagglutination activity was preferentially inhibited by mannose. The Ta-JA1 protein was able to inhibit E. coli cell growth. Overexpression of Ta-JA1 in transgenic tobacco plants increased their resistance to infection by tobacco bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens. Our results suggest that Ta-JA1 belongs to a mannose-specific lectin, which may confer a basal but broad-spectrum resistance to plant pathogens. Ta-JA1 and its homologues in maize, rice, sorghum and creeping bentgrass may represent a new type of monocot lectin with a modular structure and diversity of physiological functions in biotic and abiotic stress responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
