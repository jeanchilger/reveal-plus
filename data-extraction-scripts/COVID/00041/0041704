<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-07-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Interfering antiviral immunity: application, subversion, hope?</TITLE><BODY>RNA interference (RNAi), initially recognized as a natural antiviral mechanism in plants, has rapidly emerged as an invaluable tool to suppress gene expression in a sequence-specific manner in all organisms, including mammals. Its potential to inhibit the replication of a variety of viruses has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in mouse and monkey models. These results have generated profound interest in the use of this technology as a potential treatment strategy for viral infections for which vaccines and drugs are unavailable or inadequate. In this review, we discuss the progress made within the past 2–3 years towards harnessing the potential of RNAi for clinical application in viral infections and the hurdles that have yet to be overcome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
