However, the precise type of diseases associated with this new human rhinovirus needs to be investigated. In the present report, we used adapted real-time PCR assays to screen different clinical specimens collected from a 14-month-old boy presenting an acute lower respiratory tract disease complicated by a severe pericarditis. RT-PCR identified picornavirus RNA in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen, pericardial fluid, plasma and stools. This supported the existence of a disseminated viral infection that extended to the pericardial space. 5′UTR and VP1 sequence analysis performed directly from the BAL sample allowed genotyping of the virus as a human rhinovirus C. This observation highlights the need for adapted diagnostic tools and the potential for the new rhinovirus species C to cause complications, including pericarditis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
