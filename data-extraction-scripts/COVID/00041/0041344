The sequences are 2784 and 2630 by long, respectively, and contain a single large open reading frame encoding the VP1 protein, the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IPNV. The proteins exhibit an 88% homology with each other, but only 41% with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) VP1, another member of the Birnaviridae. Despite the low overall homology between the IPNV and IBDV VP1 proteins, homologous regions were detected within the central portion of the proteins. The carboxy-proximal regions of the VP1, which contain very low amino acid homology, displayed evidence of conservation in structural features such as a hydrophilic, highly basic domain. Consensus sequences associated with GTP-binding proteins and RdRps were also detected in VP1. However, unlike the RdRps associated with single-stranded plus RNA viruses, the birnavirus RdRp lacks the Gly-Asp-Asp motif characteristic of this enzyme family.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
