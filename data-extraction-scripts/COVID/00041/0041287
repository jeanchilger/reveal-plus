Intracellular proteins appeared earliest at 0.5 h post inoculation (p.i.) and the infection spread to virtually all cells by 48 h p.i. Viral proteins on the surface of cells were seen first at 16 h p.i., and by 48 h p.i. the entire cell monolayer was IFA positive. Hundred-fold less virus in the inoculum delayed appearance of the intracellular as well as cell-surface viral proteins by 24 h and allowed the infection of only about 1 3 of the cells by 48 h p.i. Kinetics of the development in the proportion of HAd-positive cells correlated with those of the surface fluorescence-positive cells. Morphology of the manifestation of BPI3V proteins is characterized by microphotography.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
