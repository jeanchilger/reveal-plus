One hundred and three serum or plasma samples were selected and tested: 70 were positive by both tests, 24 were negative by both tests. The in-practice test produced five false positive and four false negative results. The sensitivity of the in-practice test was 95% and the specificity was 83%. When the titres were compared it was found that the in-practice test results were significantly correlated with IFA titres but the degree of correlation was not likely to be clinically useful. The IFA titres of the four false negative samples were found to be low (less than 40) which suggests that even a cat with a false negative result is still unlikely to be excreting FCoV. A negative result with the in-practice assay is likely to be reliable for screening cats prior to entry into an FCoV-free cattery or stud. It would also be useful in the investigation of suspected FIP as most cats with this condition have high IFA titres of antibodies. A strong positive result would be useful in the diagnosis of FIP (in conjunction with other biochemical and cytological testing), but positive results would be of limited value in monitoring FCoV infection in healthy cats as the antibody titre could not be reliably compared with those obtained with IFA. All positive results obtained using the in-practice kit should be confirmed and titrated by IFA. The kit also appeared to work efficiently with ascites samples (n=6) but too few samples were analysed to draw firm conclusions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
