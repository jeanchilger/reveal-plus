<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-08-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Cephalotaxus Alkaloids</TITLE><BODY>Cephalotaxus alkaloids represent a family of plant secondary metabolites known for 60 years. Significant activity against leukemia in mice was demonstrated for extracts of Cephalotaxus. Cephalotaxine (CET) (1), the major alkaloid of this series was isolated from Cephalotaxus drupacea species by Paudler in 1963. The subsequent discovery of promising antitumor activity among new Cephalotaxus derivatives reported by Chinese, Japanese, and American teams triggered extensive structure elucidation and biological studies in this family. The structural feature of this cephalotaxane family relies mainly on its tetracyclic alkaloid backbone, which comprises an azaspiranic 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane unit (rings C and D) and a benzazepine ring system (rings A and B), which is linked by its C3 alcohol function to a chiral oxygenated side chain by a carboxylic function alpha to a tetrasubstituted carbon center. The botanical distribution of these alkaloids is limited to the Cephalotaxus genus (Cephalotaxaceae). The scope of biological activities of the Cephalotaxus alkaloids is mainly centered on the antileukemic activity of homoharringtonine (HHT) (2), which in particular demonstrated marked benefits in the treatment of orphan myeloid leukemia and was approved as soon as 2009 by European Medicine Agency and by US Food and Drug Administration in 2012. Its exact mechanism of action was partly elucidated and it was early recognized that HHT (2) inhibited protein synthesis at the level of the ribosome machinery. Interestingly, after a latency period of two decades, the topic of Cephalotaxus alkaloids reemerged as a prolific source of new natural structures. To date, more than 70 compounds have been identified and characterized. Synthetic studies also regained attention during the past two decades, and numerous methodologies were developed to access the first semisynthetic HHT (2) of high purity suitable for clinical studies, and then high grade enantiomerically pure CET (1), HHT (2), and analogs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
