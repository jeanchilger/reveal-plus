Abnormal clinical signs noted during the initial physical examination were hypothermia, dehydration, pale mucous membranes, tachypnea, and severe dyspnea. Thoracic radiographs revealed pleural effusion, an enlarged cardiac silhouette, and areas of lung consolidation. Both blood and thoracic fluid were hyperproteinemic and hypergammaglobulinemic. Antibiotic, corticosteroid, and diuretic supportive treatment provided temporary improvement. After the initial positive response to treatment, the ferret's condition progressively deteriorated until the owners decided to euthanize the patient 15 days after initial presentation. Gross necropsy results revealed 5 mL of serosanguinous fluid within the thoracic cavity, cardiomegaly, and consolidated lungs that had a patchy, pale golden tissue pattern. The histologic diagnosis was endogenous lipid pneumonia. Findings suggest that endogenous lipid pneumonia can be associated with severe respiratory disease in ferrets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
