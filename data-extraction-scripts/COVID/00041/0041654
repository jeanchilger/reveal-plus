However, a parallel commitment to education and training in this field is needed to prepare the next generation of scientists. Education and training are needed to: Improve first responder preparation and awareness, essential to public safety and preservation of the evidence integrity; Provide a larger pool of trained microbial forensics practitioners and; Educate the public and policy makers on the capabilities and limitations of microbial forensics. This chapter provides suggestions for topics, core courses, laboratories, skills, training, education programs, curricular guidelines and resources for microbial forensics that have been codified from a variety of sources including the American Society of Microbiology and American Academy of Forensic Sciences.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
