An increase in the water composition reduced the crystallization degree of AN units, resulting in a variety of the nanoparticle morphology such as the increased particle size, the reduced projection size, the increased projection number, and the decreased inter-projection distance. The difference in the projection morphology strongly affected a dispersibility in water.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
