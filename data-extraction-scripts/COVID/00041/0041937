<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-02-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Plasma therapy against infectious pathogens, as of yesterday, today and tomorrow</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Plasma therapy consists in bringing to a patient in need – in general suffering a severe, resistant to current therapy, and even lethal infection – plasma or specific, fractioned, antibodies, along with other immunoglobulins and possibly healing factors that can be obtained from immunized blood donors; donors (voluntary and benevolent) can be either actively immunized individuals or convalescent persons. Plasma therapy has been used since the Spanish flu in 1917–1918, and regularly then when viral epidemics threatened vulnerable populations, the last reported occurrence being the 2013–2015 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa. The precise action mechanism of plasma therapy is not fully delineated as it may function beyond purified, neutralizing antibodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
