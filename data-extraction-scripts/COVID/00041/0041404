<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1992-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>RNA pseudoknots</TITLE><BODY>Abstract RNA pseudoknots result from Watson-Crick base pairing involving a stretch of bases located between paired strands and a distal single-stranded region. Recently, significant advances in our understanding of their structural and functional aspects have been accomplished. At the structural level, modelling and NMR studies have shown that a defined subset of pseudoknots may be considered as tertiary motifs in RNA foldings. At the functional level, there is evidence that the realm of functions encompassed by RNA pseudoknots extends from the control of translation in prokaryotes, retroviruses and coronaviruses to the control of catalytic activity in ribozymes and the control of replication in some plant viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
