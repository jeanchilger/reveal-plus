It is well established that porcine intestinal epithelium is the target of the TGEV infection, however the mechanism that TGEV invades the host epithelium remains largely unknown. Aminopeptidase N (APN) is a known receptor of TGEV. This study discovered that the extracellular receptor binding domain 1 pertaining to epidermal growth receptor (EGFR) interact with TGEV spike protein. APN and EGFR synergistically promote TGEV invasion. TGEV promotes APN and EGFR clustering early in infection. Furthermore APN and EGFR synergistically stimulate PI3K/AKT as well as MEK/ERK1/2 endocytosis signaling pathways. TGEV entry is via clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis in IPEC-J2 cells. TGEV binds with EGFR, and subsequently promotes EGFR internalization by a clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. These results show that EGFR is a co-factor of TGEV, and that it plays a synergistic role with APN early in TGEV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
