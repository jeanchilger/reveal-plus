Each of two sets of microarrayed probes contained a pair of DNA probes and a pair of their complementary samples labeled with two distinct fluorescent dyes. The sequence of each probe is especially designed so that two targets are simultaneously complementary to two adjacent sections of the probe. The molecular steric effect on the hybridization efficiency is investigated by comparing the dye signals between configurations of one-target and two-target hybridization scenarios. The results show that a low probe concentration gives better hybridization efficiency and the first-hybridization conducted by a shorter-size DNA target improves the hybridization efficiency of the second target coupling onto the same probe.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
