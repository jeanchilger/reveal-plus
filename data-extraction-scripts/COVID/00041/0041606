If strip readers were incorporated, their use could be extended to quantitative analysis. However, their cost and non-portability render commercial strip readers unavailable for use in either home testing, community or rural hospital diagnosis. This is particularly true for on-site testing. Here, a smartphone-based reader was designed and 3D-printed for quantitatively assess AuNPs-LFIS. The basic principle of the devise was relying on a smartphone’s ambient light sensor (SPALS). This sensor was harnessed to measure the transmitted light intensities originating from the T-lines on the strips, the transmitted light intensities vary with concentration of AuNP on the T-lines. To validate this approach, our newly developed smartphone’s ambient light sensor-based reader (SPALS-reader) was used to readout AuNPs-LFIS of three analytical targets: cadmium ion (Cd2+; limit of detection (LOD) was 0.16 ng/mL), clenbuterol (CL; LOD was 0.046 ng/mL), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV; LOD was 0.055 μg/mL). The result showed good consistency with the results of conventional image analysis approaches, indicating that the smartphone-based device is appropriate for use in AuNPs-LFIS readouts. Compared with the traditional analysis method, the developed AuNPs-LFIS reader is easier operated, lower cost and more portable, which provided an on-site quantitative analysis tool for AuNPs-LFIS and enhances the applied range of AuNPs-LFIS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
