This study utilized transchromosomal bovines (TcB) vaccinated with a DNA plasmid encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein sequence to produce human polyclonal antibodies directed against Ebola virus glycoprotein. When administered 1 day postinfection, these TcB polyclonal antibodies provided partial protection and resulted in a 50% survival rate following a lethal challenge of Ebola virus Makona in rhesus macaques.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
