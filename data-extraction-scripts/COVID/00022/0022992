Efforts to enhance expression levels of transgenes coding for antigenic proteins by exploiting promoters, targeting sequences, and enhancer elements have produced rather low quantities of the antigen in plant tissues, but enough to induce immune responses in feeding studies. This review will cover components of various gene constructs used in developing plant-based vaccines against a myriad of viral and bacterial diseases. Specifically, it will focus on sequences that are involved in targeting the antigen to mucosal tissues of the intestinal tract, thus enhancing the immunogenicity of the plant-based vaccine as well as those components that result in higher accumulation of the protein within the plant.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
