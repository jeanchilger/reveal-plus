To counteract this mechanism, many pathogens have evolved to evade, subvert, or exploit autophagy. Here, we report that autophagy proteins (i.e., Beclin-1, Atg4B, Atg5, and Atg12) are proviral factors required for translation of incoming hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA and, thereby, for initiation of HCV replication, but they are not required once infection is established. These results illustrate a previously unappreciated role for autophagy in the establishment of a viral infection and they suggest that different host factors regulate the translation of incoming viral genome and translation of progeny HCV RNA once replication is established.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
