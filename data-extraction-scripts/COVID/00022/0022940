The cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of this glycoside against HIV-1 was studied in MT-4 cell culture. It was found that II was practically non-toxic for MT-4 cells while inhibiting accumulation of virus-specific protein p24 and RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) (IC(50) 3.1 ±1.0 μg/mL).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
