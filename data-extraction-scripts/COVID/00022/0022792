The CDC42 gene mutations are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes characterized by neurodevelopmental, growth, hematological, and immunological disturbances. Case presentation: We report the case of an 11-year-old boy with syndromic features, immunodeficiency, and autoinflammation who developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and malignant lymphoproliferation. In this patient, a novel heterozygous p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene was found by whole exome sequencing. Conclusions: The Cdc42 molecule plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and a wide array of tissue-specific functions, and its deregulation may result in a broad spectrum of molecular and cellular dysfunctions, making patients with CDC42 gene mutations susceptible to infections, immune dysregulation, and malignancy. In the patient studied, a syndromic phenotype with facial dysmorphism, neurodevelopmental delay, immunodeficiency, autoinflammation, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis shares common features with Takenouchi–Kosaki syndrome and with C-terminal variants in CDC42. It is important to emphasize that Hodgkin's lymphoma is described for the first time in the medical literature in a pediatric patient with the novel p.Cys81Tyr mutation in the CDC42 gene. Further studies are required to delineate precisely the CDC42 genotype–phenotype correlations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
