Using a human embryonic kidney 293T cell line to express human TLR3, we determined that poly(I-C)-induced signal could be significantly inhibited by single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs), but not ssRNA or dsDNA. The ssDNA molecules that down-modulated TLR3 signaling did not affect TLR4 and do not require the hypomethylated CpG motif found in TLR9 ligands. The degree of modulation can be altered by the length, base sequence, and modification state of the ssDNAs. An inhibitory ssDNA was found to colocalize with TLR3 in transfected cells and in a cell line that naturally expresses TLR3. The inhibitory ssDNAs can compete efficiently with dsRNA for binding purified TLR3 ectodomains in vitro, while noninhibitory nucleic acids do not. The ssDNAs also decrease the levels of several cytokines produced by the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to poly(I-C) stimulation of native TLR3. These activities indicate that ssDNAs could be used to regulate the inflammatory response through TLR3.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
