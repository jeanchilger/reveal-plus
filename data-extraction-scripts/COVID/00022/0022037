<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-10-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Ribosomal frameshifting into an overlapping gene in the 2B-encoding region of the cardiovirus genome</TITLE><BODY>The genus Cardiovirus (family Picornaviridae) currently comprises the species Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Theilovirus. Cardioviruses have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that encodes a large polyprotein (L-1ABCD-2ABC-3ABCD) that is cleaved to produce approximately 12 mature proteins. We report on a conserved ORF that overlaps the 2B-encoding sequence of EMCV in the +2 reading frame. The ORF is translated as a 128–129 amino acid transframe fusion (2B*) with the N-terminal 11–12 amino acids of 2B, via ribosomal frameshifting at a conserved GGUUUUY motif. Mutations that knock out expression of 2B* result in a small-plaque phenotype. Curiously, although theilovirus sequences lack a long ORF in the +2 frame at this genomic location, they maintain a conserved GGUUUUU motif just downstream of the 2A-2B junction, and a highly localized peak in conservation at polyprotein-frame synonymous sites suggests that theiloviruses also utilize frameshifting here, albeit into a very short +2-frame ORF. Unlike previous cases of programmed -1 frameshifting, here frameshifting is modulated by virus infection, thus suggesting a novel regulatory role for frameshifting in these viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
