Commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used for serological monitoring. The serosurvey revealed seroprevalence rates of 64.28%, 11.26%, 7.87%, 7.84%, 3.82% and 1.59% for PPV, ADV, PRCV, SIV, PRRSV and TGEV, respectively. The seroprevalence rates differed between populations and age classes with the highest number of antibody-positive wild boars in older animals (>1 year old). No antibodies to TGEV were found in Baden–Wuerttemberg and in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania (investigation period 1997/1998). In addition, sera collected in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania in 1997/1998 were negative for SIV. Even though the seroprevalence rates established for these viruses, except for PPV, were relatively low, wild boars may act as a reservoir for pathogens and a source of infection for domestic pigs and humans. Based on the epidemiological situation, no risk of a spread of these viruses should emanate from wild boars, neither for wildlife nor for livestock. However, effective and science-based disease monitoring programmes should continuously be carried out in wild boar populations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
