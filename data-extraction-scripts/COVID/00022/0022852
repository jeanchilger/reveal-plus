Carbon nanoparticles in the form of nanostrings are acting as reporters. As carbon nanotags accumulate in the test zone due to formation of an antibody-antigen-carbon nanotag antibody complex, and this allows for the direct visualization of the analytical signal. Under optimal conditions, influenza A virus can be determined in allantoic fluid inoculated with the virus with a limit of detection of 350 TCID(50).mL(−1) (i.e., the 50% tissue culture infectious dose). No interference is found for several other tested proteins, and for closely related viruses. Cell lysates containing different seasonal strains of influenza A viruses (including the H1N1 and H3N2 strains) collected from clinical samples were analyzed. It is demonstrated that the method can detect both influenza A viruses without interference by biological matrices. In our perception, this method has a wide potential in that it may be extended to a generally applicable platform for rapid diagnosis influenza A viruses.
