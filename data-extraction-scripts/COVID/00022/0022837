These new phenanthridone alkaloid analogues were obtained in both racemic and optically active forms. High enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) were achieved by applying (8S,9S)-9-amino(9-deoxy)epiquinine as an organocatalyst. Due to a side reaction, various methoxyphenanthridine regioisomers were also prepared which afforded further synthetic trans-dihydronarciclasine analogues modified in the ring A of the phenanthridone scaffold.
