Synthesis, structure, and antiviral activity of N-R-amides of 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxylic acids</TITLE><BODY>Dialkylaminoalkylamides of 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-3-carboxylic acids have been obtained as potential antiviral agents. The special features of the spatial structure of one example of the synthesized compounds have been studied. Results are given of the investigation of cytotoxicity and antiviral activity in relation to type 1 herpes virus and coronavirus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
