There is an urgent need for the development of a rapid, simple, and accurate detection method. We established a biochip assay system, including a biochip, sample preparation apparatus, hybridization instrument, chip washing machine, and laser confocal scanner equipped with interpretation software for automatic diagnosis. The biochip simultaneously identified 17 common mycobacterial species by targeting the differences in the 16S rRNA. The system was assessed with 64 reference strains and 296 Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 243 nontuberculous mycobacterial isolates, as well as 138 other bacteria and 195 sputum samples, and then compared to DNA sequencing. The entire biochip assay took 6 h. The concordance rate between the biochip assay and the DNA sequencing results was 100%. In conclusion, the biochip system provides a simple, rapid, reliable, and highly accurate clinical assay for determination of mycobacterial species in a 6-h procedure, from either culture isolates or sputum samples, allowing earlier pathogen-adapted antimicrobial therapy in patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
