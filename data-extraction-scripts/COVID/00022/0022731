The Role of Respiratory Panel PCR in Decreasing Antibiotic Exposure in Patients Diagnosed With a Respiratory Viral Infection</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: Respiratory viral infections (RVI) are becoming increasingly recognized as an important cause of pneumonia. There is limited data regarding the role of rapid PCR testing for RVI and its effect on antibiotic duration and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective chart review in adult patients who were admitted and underwent evaluation with the FilmArray Multiplex Respiratory Panel (RP) (Biomerieux™) using a random sample from July 1, 2016 through April 1, 2018. Patient clinical and virologic characteristics, LOS, antibiotic use, and duration of treatment were collected. A Student’s t-test was performed for all comparisons. RESULTS: We identified 540 patients who were admitted and underwent RP testing. The mean age was 57.1 years (range 19–99), 50.2% were immunocompromised, 23.8% were transplant recipients, 70.4% had respiratory symptoms, and 35.7% had an admitting diagnosis of pneumonia. 55.6% required supplemental O(2) and 24.6% had an ICU admission that required either noninvasive or mechanical ventilation. 22.6% (N = 122) of these patients were diagnosed with an RVI, of which 15 were co-infected with two or more respiratory viruses. There were 41 (34%) rhinovirus/enterovirus, 41 (34%) influenza (Types A/H1, A/H3, A/H1-2209, and B), 16 (13%) RSV, 15 (12%) coronavirus (Types NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1), 13 (11%) metapneumovirus, and 7 (5%) parainfluenza (Types 2, 3, and 4). 85.2% (104/122) of patients with an RVI received antibiotics. The mean LOS and antibiotic duration were 9.07 days and 7.31 days for patients with an RVI when compared with 11.5 days and 10.4 days for patients without an RVI (P = 0.098; P = 0.032), respectively. In patients with an RVI and negative bacterial cultures, the mean LOS was 8.4 days and mean antibiotic duration was 5.9 days when compared with 16.4 days and 15.5 days for all patients with positive bacterial cultures (P = 0.003; P < 0.0001), respectively. The mean time from available results of + RP to antibiotic discontinuation was 5.1 days in the setting of negative bacterial cultures. CONCLUSION: Although antibiotic exposure and time to discontinuation still remained significant in patients diagnosed with an RVI, there was a marked reduction in LOS and antibiotic duration in the subset of patients with an RVI and negative bacterial cultures.
