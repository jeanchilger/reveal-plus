However many (non-retrovirus) RNA viruses can establish “within host” persistent infections that occasionally lead to chronic or reactivated disease. Despite the importance of “within host” persistent RNA virus infections, much has still to be learnt about the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses establish persistent infections, why innate and adaptive immune responses fail to rapidly clear these infections, and the epidemiological and potential disease consequences of such infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
