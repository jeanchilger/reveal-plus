METHODS: The current available randomized controlled trials of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine on SARS were identified through systematically searching literature in any languages or any types of publications. Additional studies of gray literature were also collected. The quality of studies was evaluated by two investigators independently based largely on the quality criteria specified CONSORT. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using RevMan 4.2.0 software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: Six studies (n = 366) fulfilling the inclusion criteria were found, of which the quality of one study was graded as B, the remaining five were graded as C. Two studies were performed with meta-analysis, the other four studies existed some heterogeneity for which meta-analysis could not be performed, a significant effect on lung infiltrate absorption was found in the treatment groups of these two studies [RR 6.68, 95%CI (2.93, 15.24), P < 0.01], there was no significant differences between the mortality [RR 0.86, 95%CI (0.22, 3.29), P = 0.82] and the average dosage of corticosteroid [WMD -39.65, 95%CI (-116.84, 37.54), P = 0.31]. The other three studies also showed significant differences in infiltrate absorption, including national drug No. 2. 3. 4 in combination with Western medicine [RR 5.45, 95%CI (1.54, 19.26)], compound formulas NO. 1 combined with Western medicine [WMD 0.24, 95%CI (0.02, 0.46)], compound formulas combined with Western medicine [RR 8.06, 95%CI (0.40, 163.21)]. Kangfeidian No.4 in combination with Western medicine had no significant effect on symptom improvement such as loss of dyspnea and cough [RR 1.50, 95%CI (0.41, 5.43)] and [RR 1.29, 95%CI (0.30, 5.43)]. CONCLUSION: Integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicines has some positive effects on lung infiltrate absorption in SARS patients, and is recommended as an adjunct treatment for SARS. However, its effect on SARS requires further careful study due to limited available randomized control trials.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
