Our study describes the neuropathology and the diagnostic features of 26 cases of FIP in domestic cats. The average age of affected individuals was 11.8 mo, and there was no sex or breed predisposition. Clinical neurologic signs were noted in 22 cases, and rabies was clinically suspected in 11 cases. Twenty cats had lesions in multiple organs, and 6 cats had lesions only in the brain. Gross neuropathologic changes occurred in 15 cases and consisted of hydrocephalus (10 cases), cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum (6 cases), cerebral swelling with flattening of gyri (2 cases), and accumulation of fibrin within ventricles (2 cases) or leptomeninges (1 case). Histologically, 3 main distinct distributions of neuropathologic changes were observed, namely periventricular encephalitis (12 cases), rhombencephalitis (8 cases), and diffuse leptomeningitis with superficial encephalitis (6 cases). Fresh tissue samples were submitted for fluorescent antibody testing (FAT) after autopsy in 17 cases, and positive results were found in only 7 cases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for feline coronavirus confirmed the diagnosis in all 26 cases. IHC appears to be a more sensitive and reliable test for confirmation of FIP than is FAT.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
