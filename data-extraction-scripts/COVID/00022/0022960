To expand current knowledge of the transcriptome and functional genomics in this species, a de novo transcriptome sequence analysis of young and mature leaf tissues of T. sinensis was performed using the Illumina platform. Over 8.1 Gb of data were generated, assembled into 64,541 unigenes, and annotated with known biological functions. Proteins involved in primary metabolite biosynthesis were identified based on similarities to known proteins, including some related to biosynthesis of carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, and energy. Analysis of unigenes differentially expressed between young and mature leaves (transcriptomic libraries ‘YL’ and ‘ML’, respectively) showed that the KEGG pathways of phenylpropanoid, naringenin, lignin, cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis were significantly enriched in mature leaves. These results not only expand knowledge of transcriptome characteristics for this valuable species, but also provide a useful transcriptomic dataset to accelerate the researches on its metabolic mechanisms and functional genomics. This study can also further the understanding of unique aromatic metabolism and Chinese medicinal properties of T. sinensis.
