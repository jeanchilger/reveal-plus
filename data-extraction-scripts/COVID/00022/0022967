During the past decade, significant progresses have been made to characterize PRRs such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TLR- and RLR-mediated signaling. To avoid excessive and harmful immune effects caused by over-activation of these signaling pathways, host cells adopt a number of strategies to regulate them. In addition, invading viruses also employ a variety of mechanisms to inhibit the production of type I IFNs, thereby evading the supervision and clearance by the host. In this review, we briefly summarize the TLR- and RLR-mediated type I IFN signaling and then focus on the mechanisms by which host cellular and viral components regulate the expression of type I IFNs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
