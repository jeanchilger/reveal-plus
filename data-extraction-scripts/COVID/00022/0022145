The introduction of a specific prion-binding ligand gel in combination with SD treatment, time-reduced from 4 to 1-1.5 h, still ensures efficient virus kill, reduces abnormal prion protein by >5 log steps, and preserves levels of plasmin inhibitor at close to the reference range. Infections with known non-enveloped viruses such as HAV or parvovirus B19 are prevented by ensuring low virus loads in the starting plasma units, dilution through pooling of single plasma units, and neutralization of immune antibodies already present in the initial plasma pools. The major advantages of SD plasma over fresh frozen plasma and the other pathogen-inactivated plasmas are its extreme safety with respect to transfusion-related acute lung injury and the significantly lower likelihood of provoking allergic reactions. Both advantages are best interpreted as results of the dilution effect of pooling. No fewer than 18 clinical studies covering all indications for plasma, and extensive clinical experience have shown that reduced levels of coagulation factors and inhibitors as a result of SD treatment do not impair significantly the clinical efficacy or tolerance of plasma. Properly standardized clotting factor and inhibitor potencies and low batch-to-batch variations when compared with single-donor plasma units makes SD plasma more suitable for standardized treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
