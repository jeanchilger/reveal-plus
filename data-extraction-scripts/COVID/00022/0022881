<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-11-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Prevalence of seropositivity to pathogens in small carnivores in adjacent areas of Lazovskii Reserve</TITLE><BODY>The prevalence of infectious diseases in wild and feral carnivores is poorly known in Primorsky Krai, where rare species such as the Amur tiger and the Far East leopard roam. In this study we evaluated the prevalence of seropositivity in feral (cats, dogs) and wild (raccoon dog, badger, American mink, Far Eastern wild cat) carnivores to various pathogens: distemper virus, parvovirus, feline immunodeficiency and feline leukemia virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycoplasma sp., and Chlamydia sp. It was shown that seropositivity occurred significantly more frequent in feral animals than in wild ones. The highest percentage of seropositive animals was observed in feral dogs. It is these diseases that can be dangerous for the Amur tiger and the Far East leopard, thus affecting their populations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
