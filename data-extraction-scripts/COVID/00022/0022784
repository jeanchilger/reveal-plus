When tested on genomic sequences obtained from the National Center of Biotechnology Information in various monospecific and polyspecific in silico experiments, the proposed probe design method was able to select a small number of oligo probes of length 7 or 8 nucleotides that perfectly classified all unseen testing sequences. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed probe design method and illustrate the usefulness and potential a well-designed optimization-based probe selection method has in genotyping applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
