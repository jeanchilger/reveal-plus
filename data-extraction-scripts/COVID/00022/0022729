Role of Human bocavirus Respiratory Tract Infection in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: Limited data exist regarding the impact of human bocavirus (BoV) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. We examined incidence and disease spectrum of BoV respiratory tract infection (RTI) in HCT recipients. METHODS: In a longitudinal surveillance study of viral RTIs among allogeneic HCT recipients, pre-HCT and weekly post-HCT nasal washes and symptom surveys were collected through day 100, then every 3 months, and whenever respiratory symptoms occurred through 1-year post-HCT. Samples were tested by multiplex semi-quantitative PCR for RSV, parainfluenza virus 1–4, influenza A/B, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and BoV. Plasma samples from BoV+ subjects were analyzed by PCR. In addition, we conducted a retrospective review of HCT recipients with BoV detected in bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy. RESULTS: Among 469 patients in the prospective cohort, 21 distinct BoV RTIs (3 pre-HCT and 18 post-HCT) were observed by 1-year post-HCT in 19 patients (median 42 years old, range 0–67) without apparent seasonality. BoV was more frequently detected in the latter half of the first 100 days post-HCT (Figure 1). The frequencies of respiratory symptoms in patients with BoV detected did not appear to be higher than those without any virus detected, with the exception of watery eyes (P < 0.01) (Figure 2). Univariable models among patients with BoV RTI post-HCT showed higher peak viral load in nasal samples (P = 0.04) and presence of respiratory copathogens (P = 0.03) were associated with presence of respiratory symptoms; however, BoV detection in plasma was not (P = 0.8). Retrospective review identified 6 allogeneic HCT recipients (range 1–64 years old) with BoV detected in lower respiratory tract specimens [incidence rate of 0.4% (9/2,385) per sample tested]. Although all 6 cases presented with hypoxemia, 4 had significant respiratory copathogens or concomitant conditions that contributed to respiratory compromise. No death was attributed mainly to BoV lower RTI. CONCLUSION: BoV is infrequently detected in respiratory tract in HCT recipients. Our studies did not demonstrate convincing evidence that BoV is a significant pathogen in either upper or lower respiratory tracts. Watery eyes were associated with BoV detection.
