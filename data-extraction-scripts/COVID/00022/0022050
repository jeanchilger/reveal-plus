We previously demonstrated that apoD protects against neuropathology by controlling the level of peroxidated lipids. Here, we further investigated the biological function of apoD in a mouse model of acute encephalitis. Our results show that apoD transcript and protein are upregulated during acute encephalitis induced by the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) infection. The apoD upregulation coincides with glial activation, and its expression returns to normal levels when the virus is cleared, concomitantly to a resolved glial reactivity. In addition, the overexpression of human apoD in the neurons of Thy-1/ApoD transgenic mice results in a threefold increase of the number of mice surviving to HCoV-OC43 infection. This increased survival rate is correlated with an upregulated glial activation associated with a limited innate immune response (cytokines, chemokines) and T-cell infiltration into infected brains. Moreover, the protection seems to be associated with a restricted phospholipase A2 activity. These data reveal a role for apoD in the regulation of inflammation and suggest that it protects from HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis, most likely through the phospholipase A2 signaling pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
