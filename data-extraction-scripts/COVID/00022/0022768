Still, their precise pathogenic potential is largely unknown, particularly regarding the most recently identified species HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. HCoVs need host cell proteins to successively establish infections. Proteases of the renin–angiotensin system serve as receptors needed for entry into target cells; this article describes the current knowledge on the involvement of this system in HCoV pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
