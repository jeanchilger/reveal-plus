Antibody tests are widely used but cannot differentiate between vaccination and reinfection. We developed a PRRSV antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of North American and European PRRSV. This antigen assay detected purified N protein from both genotypes at levels as low as 0.4 and 0.8 ng, respectively. The specificity and sensitivity of the N antigen assay were evaluated with ground lung tissues from 8 PRRSV-infected and 16 healthy swine, and culture supernatants from six PRRSV isolates as well as other swine viruses were confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Antigen assays were positive in all eight infected tissues and with six different PRRSV isolates, with no false positives among healthy tissues and other swine viruses (i.e., pseudorabies and foot and mouth disease viruses). A number of sera, field collected from 466 vaccinated and asymptomatic pigs in Guangdong, China, between 2008 and 2009, tested positive by the N antigen assay (12.45%), RT-PCR (15.02%), and a commercial test for antibodies against PRRSV (78.97%). Of the 466 sera, 47 were positive by both antigen and RT-PCR tests, 11 by antigen test only, and 23 by RT-PCR only; the two assays had an overall agreement of 92.7%, indicating a significant percentage of active PRRSV in asymptomatic pigs despite previous immunization. These findings suggest that the antigen assay is a valuable field tool for the epidemiological control of PRRSV that can be used for rapid screening, particularly in asymptomatic animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
