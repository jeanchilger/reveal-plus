Peptide modification by altering the anchor residue facilitates increased binding affinity and may elicit T cells with increased functional avidity towards the native epitope (“heteroclitic”). This augmented MHC binding is likely to increase the half-life and surface density of the heteroclitic complex but precisely how this enhanced T cell response occurs in vivo is not known. Furthermore, the ideal heteroclitic epitope will elicit T cell responses that completely cross-react with the native epitope, maximizing protection and minimizing undesirable off-target effects. Such epitopes have been difficult to identify. Here, using mice infected with a murine coronavirus that encodes epitopes that elicit high (S510, CSLWNGPHL) and low (S598, RCQIFANI) functional avidity responses, we show that increased expression of peptide S598 but not S510 generated T cells with enhanced functional avidity. Thus immune responses can be augmented towards T cell epitopes with low functional avidity by increasing antigen density. We also identified a heteroclitic epitope (RCVIFANI) that elicited a T cell response with nearly complete cross-reactivity with native epitope and demonstrated increased MHC-peptide abundance compared to native S598. Structural and thermal melt analyses indicated that the Q600V substitution enhanced stability of the peptide-MHC complex without greatly altering the antigenic surface, resulting in highly cross-reactive T cell responses. Our data highlight that increased pMHC complex display contributes to heteroclitic epitope efficacy and describe parameters for maximizing immune responses that cross-react with the native epitope.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
