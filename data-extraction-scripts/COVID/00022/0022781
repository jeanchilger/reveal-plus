Anticancer activity for the same compounds was also screened on four different cell lines: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO cells), Colo 205 (human colon cancer), Sup-T1 (human lymphoma) and C6 glioma (rat glioma) by MTT assay method. The compounds (3j–l) have shown significant activity against Mycobacterium strain and the compound 3l has shown specific cytotoxic activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
