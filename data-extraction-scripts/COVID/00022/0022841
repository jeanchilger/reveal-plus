Of six homogenization buffers tested, 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 7.0) gave the best results for the ICA. In the ICA, addition of 0.1% thioglycolic acid in the homogenization buffers that have been widely used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) was deleterious to the reaction because of undesirable coagulation of the colloidal gold. ICA using the anti-SDV monoclonal antibodies was 8 times and 16 times more sensitive than double antibody sandwich-ELISA and ICA using the anti-SDV polyclonal antibody, respectively. The analysis is complete in only 15 min. Furthermore, ICA using the anti-SDV monoclonal antibodies could also detect SDV-related viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
