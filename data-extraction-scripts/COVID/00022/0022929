<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-02-22</DATELINE><TITLE>From SARS to pandemic influenza: the framing of high-risk populations</TITLE><BODY>The 2003 global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a wake-up call for health systems in Canada, with realization of occupational health risks faced by health care workers and first responders in public health emergency response. The need for investment in critical social infrastructure—including explicitly articulated plans—became a priority for managing future pandemics. Over the past 15 years, pandemic planning has evolved with the adoption of a whole-of-society approach to disaster risk reduction. There is recognition of the social gradient of risk, which emerges from the interaction between social determinants of health, risk of exposure, and adverse impacts from a pandemic. Additionally, there is better understanding of the benefits of planning according to functional needs, rather than deficit-oriented labelling. In this paper, we reflect on how the framing of vulnerable or high-risk populations has evolved since SARS. Looking to the future, we present the imperative for the creation of institutional space for engagement of high-risk populations in pandemic planning processes, including participatory governance. Innovative consultation strategies are needed to enhance collective asset literacy and ensure planning is adaptive to the changing social fabric. Progressive pandemic planning in the next decade must be inclusive and sensitive to modern definitions of family, varied abilities, cultural practices and gender and sexual diversity, thereby reflecting a whole-of-society approach to disaster risk reduction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
