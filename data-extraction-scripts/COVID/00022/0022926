Advances in science and technology have allowed very detailed study on the pathogenesis of this novel virus, and many have already been published in less than a year after the start of the pandemic. Information generated from cell lines, animal models, and clinical data analysis has provided us with greater understanding of the behavior of this virus and the associated host response. The new knowledge will allow us to formulate scientifically sound and evidence-based management plans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
