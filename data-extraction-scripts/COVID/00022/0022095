<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-02-13</DATELINE><TITLE>Identification of a Coronavirus Transcription Enhancer</TITLE><BODY>Coronavirus (CoV) transcription includes a discontinuous mechanism during the synthesis of sub-genome-length minus-strand RNAs leading to a collection of mRNAs in which the 5′ terminal leader sequence is fused to contiguous genome sequences. It has been previously shown that transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) preceding each gene regulate transcription. Base pairing between the leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complement of the body TRS (cTRS-B) in the nascent RNA is a determinant factor during CoV transcription. In fact, in transmissible gastroenteritis CoV, a good correlation has been observed between subgenomic mRNA (sg mRNA) levels and the free energy (ΔG) of TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex formation. The only exception was sg mRNA N, the most abundant sg mRNA during viral infection in spite of its minimum ΔG associated with duplex formation. We postulated that additional factors should regulate transcription of sg mRNA N. In this report, we have described a novel transcription regulation mechanism operating in CoV by which a 9-nucleotide (nt) sequence located 449 nt upstream of the N gene TRS core sequence (CS-N) interacts with a complementary sequence just upstream of CS-N, specifically increasing the accumulation of sg mRNA N. Alteration of this complementarity in mutant replicon genomes showed a correlation between the predicted stability of the base pairing between 9-nt sequences and the accumulation of sg mRNA N. This interaction is exclusively conserved in group 1a CoVs, the only CoV subgroup in which the N gene is not the most 3′ gene in the viral genome. This is the first time that a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction regulating transcriptional activity specifically enhancing the transcription of one gene has been described to occur in CoVs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
