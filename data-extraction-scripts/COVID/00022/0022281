However, determining the causal mutation by traditional mapping and candidate gene sequencing is often the rate-limiting step, especially when analyzing many mutants. We report two genomic approaches for more rapidly determining the identity of the affected genes in Caenorhabditis elegans mutants. First, we report our use of restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) polymorphism markers for rapidly mapping mutations after chemical mutagenesis and mutant isolation. Second, we describe our use of genomic interval pull-down sequencing (GIPS) to selectively capture and sequence megabase-sized portions of a mutant genome. Together, these two methods provide a rapid and cost-effective approach for positional cloning of C. elegans mutant loci, and are also applicable to other genetic model systems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
