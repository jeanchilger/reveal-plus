Here, we describe CoV infections and clinical characteristics among adults (>18 years) presenting with respiratory illness in Cleveland, Ohio. METHODS: Between February 1, 2016 and April 30, 2017, 2949 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed by NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel in adults presenting with respiratory illness at MetroHealth Medical Center. Clinical data were collected on adults whose samples screened positive for CoV-HKU1, CoV-OC43, CoV-229E or CoV-NL63. RESULTS: Coronaviruses were detected in 192 (6.5%) adults including 105 (3.5%) OC43, 67 (2.3%) 229E, 13 (0.4%) HKU1 and 7 (0.2%) NL63. The majority of adults with coronavirus infection were females (66.2%) with a median age of 53 years. Common comorbidities included smoking (40.0%), asthma (38.0%), COPD (35.4%), and inhaled corticosteroid use (28.6%). Eighty-five (46.4%) required admission to the hospital. Common presenting symptoms included shortness of breath (42.7%) and cough (31.0%) whereas fever was uncommon (12.5%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in HKU1 and NL63 infected adults. Seventy-three percent of coronavirus disease occurred between the months of January and March. Despite the recognition of coronavirus infection, 70 (36.5%) received antibiotics for their disease. CONCLUSION: This study provides needed insight into clinical characteristics and severity associated with coronavirus infection in adults. Coronavirus infection should be considered in differential diagnosis of respiratory tract illness in adults including those that require hospitalization, have a history of smoking and have pulmonary comorbidities.
