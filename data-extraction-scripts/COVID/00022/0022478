However, an alternate model was recently proposed in which ebolavirus enters through a later NPC1-negative endosome that contains two-pore Ca(2+) channel 2 (TPC2), a newly identified ebolavirus entry factor. Here, using live cell imaging, we obtained evidence that in contrast to the new model, ebolavirus enters cells through endolysosomes that contain both NPC1 and TPC2.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
