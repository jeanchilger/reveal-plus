Cells were cultured at different temperatures and membrane changes involving the Golgi apparatus and Golgi apparatus-associated membrane structures were monitored by electron microscopy and quantitated. With 30 min of incubation, membranes of the Golgi apparatus stack increased in amount at temperatures of 16°C and below compared to temperatures above 18°C. The increase was greatest along the major polarity axis as evidenced by an increased stack height. Neither the number of cisternae per stack nor the average stack diameter (width) was affected by temperature. The response was maximal between 15 and 30 min of low temperature treatment of the cells. Results with cells infected and uninfected with feline immunodeficiency virus were similar. The increase in stack height was due primarily to an increase of membranes at the cis face (cis Golgi apparatus network). At 18°C, membranes of the trans Golgi apparatus network accumulated suggesting that import from the cis Golgi network could proceed at this temperature, whereas exit from the trans Golgi network was still at least partially blocked. Also increased at 16°C and below were numbers of transition vesicles in the space between the Golgi apparatus and the transitional endoplasmic reticulum associated with the cis Golgi apparatus face. The results suggested interruption of the orderly flux of membranes into the Golgi apparatus at 16°C and below. Moreover, the block appeared to be reversible. Upon transfer from 16°C to 37°C, there was a time-dependent decrease in the accumulations of cis compartment membrane accompanied by a corresponding equivalent increase in the membranes of the trans Golgi apparatus compartment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
