<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1988</DATELINE><TITLE>Cell culture propagation of bovine coronavirus</TITLE><BODY>Although most field strains of bovine coronavirus (BCV) grow poorly in cell culture and fail to produce cytopathic effects (CPE) until after blind passage, primary calf kidney (PCK) and Vero cells have permitted primary isolation of virus. Cell culture-adapted strains of BCV replicate in PCK, bovine embryonic lung, bovine fetal thyroid, bovine fetal brain, bovine skin cells, ovine fetal kidney cells, and the cell lines pig kidney K3 and 15, Vero, human embryonic lung fibroblasts, HRT-18, MDBK and BEK-1, with trypsin useful for enhancing replication. Organ culture as well as suckling mouse, rat, and hamster brains also support the growth of cell culture-adapted BCV strains. Viral growth is most commonly detected by CPE, immunofluorescence, hemagglutination, and hemadsorption assays or electron microscopy of supernatants from infected cells. In this report, the optimal conditions for the growth and plaque assay of the NCDV strain of BCV in MDBK cells are described.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
