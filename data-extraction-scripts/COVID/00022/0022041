Using a full-length infectious construct of transmissable gastroenteritis virus, the present study demonstrates that subgenomic transcription is heavily influenced by upstream flanking sequences and supports a mechanism of transcription attenuation that is regulated in part by a larger domain composed of primarily upstream flanking sequences which select appropriately positioned CS elements for synthesis of subgenomic RNAs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
