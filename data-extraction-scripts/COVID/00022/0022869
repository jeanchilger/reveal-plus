Calves with single infections had higher serum concentrations of sodium and calcium, and less potassium, copper, and iron, which was not statistically significant. They also had significantly shorter P and QRS wave amplitudes and longer T wave duration in electrocardiogram patterns.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
