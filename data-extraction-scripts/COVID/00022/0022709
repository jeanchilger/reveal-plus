<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-12-01</DATELINE><TITLE>PSXIII-19 Swine Health Health and Management Evaluation in American Samoa.</TITLE><BODY>American Samoa is working to improve swine production genetics and management. Our objective was to identify health and management factors affecting swine performance. A1998 survey found six leptospirosis serovars and parvovirus and heavy parasites loads, but no brucellosis or pseudorabies. Our 2016 Artificial Insemination Training focused on improving genetics and resulted in 12 sows bred and 103 piglets born. Oour 2017 Swine Farm Evaluation surveyed 26 farms with an average of 9 sows per farm. Serological samples were tested for antibodies against Porcine Circovirus Type 2b (ELISA, 96% positive), Swine Influenza (ELISA, 31%), Senecavirus (IFA, 27%), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (ELISA, 15%), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (IFA, 15%), and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (ELISA, 4%, 1 pig). o evidence was seen of Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (ELISA), Transmissable Gastroenteritis (ELISA) or Pseudorabies (SN). Fecal samples contained Ascaris suum, Oesophagostomum dentatum, Stephanurus dentatus, and, less commonly, Strongyles nodular worm, Stronglyloides, Brachylaemus suis, Necator species, Trichuris suis, and Fasciolopsis buski. Ear scrapings and scratching behavior indicated the presence of sarcoptic mange (31% of farms). Most farms fed a 14% grain feed (88% of farms) and local feeds (coconut, vegetables, fruits, 69%); only one farm fed an 18% starter and one fed milk to young pigs. One or more thin pigs were seen on 46% of farms. Waste is managed either by wash down (85% of farms) or as dry litter (42%); some farms used both. Wastewater concerns led to water restriction on 12% of farms. In conclusion, parasites and suboptimal feeding are constraints on pig growth and performance. Management recommendations to improve production should address these, in addition to improving health and genetics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
