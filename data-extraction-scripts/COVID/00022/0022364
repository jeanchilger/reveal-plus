METHODS: Anti-EBOV antibody was measured by 2 neutralization and 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in convalescent plasma (ECP) from 100 EVD survivor donors in Liberia. Viral load was assessed repetitively in patients with EVD participating in a clinical trial of enhanced standard of care plus ECP. RESULTS: All 4 anti-EBOV assays were highly concordant for detection of EBOV antibody. Antibodies were not detected in plasma specimens obtained from 15 of 100 donors, including 7 with documented EBOV-positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction during EVD. Viral load was reduced following each dose in the 2 clinical trial participants who received ECP with higher antibody levels but not in the 2 who received ECP with lower antibody levels. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery from EVD can occur with absence of detectable anti-EBOV antibody several months after disease onset. ELISAs may be useful to select ECP donors or identify ECP units that contain neutralizing antibody. ECP with higher anti-EBOV antibody levels may have greater effect on EBOV load—an observation that requires further investigation. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT02333578.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
