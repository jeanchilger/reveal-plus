With the advances in molecular diagnostics and the introduction of high-throughput screening techniques a variety of novel, so far unknown viruses have been discovered from respiratory secretions. However, the clinical significance is often difficult to determine. This review article provides an introduction to those novel viruses which have been described since the beginning of the millennium and discusses the clinical relevance in the light of current scientific evidence. The viruses covered by the present review are human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1, SARS and MERS, human polyomaviruses KI, MC and WU and human parechoviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
