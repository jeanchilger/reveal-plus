Control of neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) requires the collaboration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, with CD8(+) T cells providing direct perforin and gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-mediated antiviral activity. To distinguish bystander from direct antiviral contributions of CD4(+) T cells in virus clearance and pathology, memory CD4(+) T cells purified from wild type (wt), perforin-deficient (PKO), and IFN-γ-deficient (GKO) immune donors were transferred to immunodeficient SCID mice prior to CNS challenge. All three donor CD4(+) T-cell populations controlled CNS virus replication at 8 days postinfection, indicating IFN-γ- and perforin-independent antiviral function. Recipients of GKO CD4(+) T cells succumbed more rapidly to fatal disease than untreated control infected mice. In contrast, wt and PKO donor CD4(+) T cells cleared infectious virus to undetectable levels and protected from fatal disease. Recipients of all CD4(+) T-cell populations exhibited demyelination. However, it was more severe in wt CD4(+) T-cell recipients. These data support a role of CD4(+) T cells in virus clearance and demyelination. Despite substantial IFN-γ-independent antiviral activity, IFN-γ was crucial in providing protection from death. IFN-γ reduced neutrophil accumulation and directed macrophages to white matter but did not ameliorate myelin loss.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
