Infection of CCR2-deficient (CCR2(−/−)) mice with T. cruzi resulted in increased cardiac parasitism, yet the severity of cardiac inflammation was not affected. In addition, expression of interferon-γ and inducible NO synthase in the heart, which are associated with effective killing of trypomastigotes, was not affected in CCR2(−/−) mice. These observations reveal that CCR2 signaling plays a distinct role that is separate from that of influencing either chemotaxis or previously defined anti-trypomastigote mechanisms for the control of T. cruzi’s replication in the heart&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
