We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of SARS in 165 clinically confirmed severe cases. Both age and existence of other diseases before SARS were significantly correlated with prognosis (r = 0.506 and r = 0.457, respectively; P < .001). During the acute phase of SARS, lactate dehydrogenase level, degree of hypoxemia, respiratory rate, α-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase level, creatine kinase isoenzyme—MB, platelet count, and number of involved lobes noted on chest radiographs, and so on, correlated markedly with the prognosis (r = 0.257–0.788; P < .05). The multivariate prognosis regression model was associated with degree of hypoxemia and platelet count. The model was defined by the formula P(y=1) = e(s)/(1 + e(s)), where S is [2.490 × degree of hypoxemia]-[0.050 × number of platelets], and it had a high sensitivity (91.67%), specificity (98.33%), and accuracy (96.42%). The model could be used to effectively judge the state of illness and the prognosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
