It is now believed that the availability of antiviral drugs effective against SARS-CoV will be crucial for the control of future SARS outbreaks. Recently, RNA interference has been successfully used as a more specific and efficient method for gene silencing. RNA interference induced by small interfering RNA can inhibit the expression of viral antigens and so provides a new approach to the therapy of pathogenic viruses. This review provides an overview of current information on coronavirus and the application of small interfering RNA in viral therapeutics, with particular reference to SARS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
