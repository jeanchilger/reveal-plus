IEM enabled the direct visualization of antigen-antibody interaction, as the particles were aggregated and coated by specific antibodies. This allowed the recognition and identification of a 27-nm virus-like particle that did not have a distinctive morphology, was low-titered, and was among the smallest viruses known. Serum antibody responses to the 27-nm particle were demonstrated in key individuals infected under natural or experimental conditions; this and other evidence suggested that this virus-like particle was the etiologic agent of the Norwalk gastroenteritis outbreak. The fastidious 27-nm Norwalk virus is now considered to be the prototype strain of a group of noncultivatable viruses that are important etiologic agents of epidemic gastroenteritis in adults and older children.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
