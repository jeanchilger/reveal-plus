Previous studies have shown an increased number of inflammatory macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS) of ROCV-infected mice, implying a role for macrophages in the pathogenesis of ROCV. Here, we show that ROCV infection results in increased expression of CCL2 in the blood and in infiltration of macrophages into the brain. Moreover, we show, using CCR2 knockout mice, that CCR2 expression is essential for macrophage infiltration in the brain during ROCV infection and that the lack of CCR2 results in increased disease severity and mortality. Thus, our findings show the protective role of CCR2-mediated infiltration of macrophages in the brain during ROCV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
