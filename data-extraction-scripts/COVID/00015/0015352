Recommendations regarding preparation for a global avian influenza pandemic are available, and it is imperative that health care workers participate in preparedness planning and training. In developing countries, health care worker preparedness training should address the modes of avian influenza transmission and specify how to implement appropriate infection-control strategies to prevent and control the spread of avian influenza. We provide evidence for avian influenza transmission methods and identify prevention strategies relevant to infection control for hospitals in developing countries. Pandemic influenza preparedness plans must include health care administrative support, mechanisms to rapidly create temporary isolation facilities, systems to restrict access to exposed health care workers, and plans to involve specialists to screen and identify cases early, to provide for continuous monitoring to ensure adherence to optimal infection-control practices, and to provide regular feedback to health care workers&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
