Recombinant virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are suggested to be potential promising platforms to protect against these respiratory viruses. This review updates important progress in the development of VLP vaccines against respiratory viruses. Areas Covered: This review summarizes progress in developing VLP and nanoparticle-based vaccines against influenza virus, RSV, and HMPV. The PubMed was mainly used to search for important research articles published since 2010 although earlier key articles were also referenced. The research area covered includes VLP and nanoparticle platform vaccines against seasonal, pandemic, and avian influenza viruses as well as RSV and HMPV respiratory viruses. The production methods, immunogenic properties, and vaccine efficacy of respiratory VLP vaccines in preclinical animal models and clinical studies were reviewed in this article. Expert opinion: Previous and current preclinical and clinical studies suggest that recombinant VLP and nanoparticle vaccines are expected to be developed as promising alternative platforms against respiratory viruses in future. Therefore, continued research efforts are warranted.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
