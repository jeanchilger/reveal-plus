Seventeen individuals met the case definition for febrile respiratory illness, and diagnostic specimens were obtained from 16. Laboratory testing identified influenza A for 44%; sequence analysis demonstrated that these were Fujian-like influenza strains, which represented the predominant strain found globally in 2003/2004. Other pathogens identified included coronavirus OC43, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. Logistical challenges were overcome as laboratory-supported febrile respiratory illness surveillance was conducted during a military training exercise. With heightened concern over the potential for another global influenza pandemic, such surveillance could prove critical for the detection of emerging influenza and respiratory pathogen strains with potential for importation to the United States.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
