The UreB-producing strains were then administered orally to mice, and the immune response to UreB was examined. Orally vaccinated mice produced a significant UreB-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response. Specific anti-UreB IgA responses could be detected in the feces of mice immunized with the secreting lactococcal strain. Mice vaccinated orally were significantly protected against gastric Helicobacter infection following a challenge with H. pylori strain SS1. In conclusion, mucosal vaccination with L. lactis expressing UreB produced serum IgG and UreB-specific fecal IgA, and prevented gastric infection with H. pylori.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
