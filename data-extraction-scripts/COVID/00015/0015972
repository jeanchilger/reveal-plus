A common modification of sialic acids is O-acetylation. O-Acetylated sialic acids occur in bacteria and parasites and are also receptor determinants for a number of viruses. Moreover, they have important functions in embryogenesis, development, and immunological processes. O-Acetylated sialic acids represent cancer markers, as shown for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and they are known to play significant roles in the regulation of ganglioside-mediated apoptosis. Expression of O-acetylated sialoglycans is regulated by sialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferases and O-acetylesterases. Recent developments in the identification of the enigmatic sialic acid-specific O-acetyltransferase are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
