Induction of heat shock proteins (HSP), i.e. of the major family member HSP70, is an important cytoprotective-resistance mechanism for monocytes/ macrophages (Mphi). Patients on haemodialysis present with a high infectious morbidity and enhanced carcinoma incidence. Renal insufficiency-related alteration of microbicidal and tumoricidal functions of Mphi, major effectors of the immune system, might promote these diseases. Methods. Freshly isolated Mphi from Sprague–Dawley rats 2 weeks after 5/6-nephrectomy and from patients on intermittent haemodialysis (IHD) were stimulated by heat shock (HS) and compared to stimulated Mphi of control rats or healthy volunteers (CTR). Expression of HSP72 (inducible HSP70) was assessed by RT-PCR, and/or flow cytometry. Apoptosis of Mphi was detected by flow cytometry (CD14/annexin V-labelling). Results. In rat Mphi, baseline HSP72 expression was similar in both groups, but its induction was significantly impaired in renal insufficiency (214 ± 68% less HSP70-mRNA versus CTR, n = 6). In patients, HSF-1-mRNA and HSP72-mRNA/protein response to HS was significantly lower, but not affected by dialysis session itself. In parallel, apoptosis of Mphi of patients was enhanced (+83 ± 29% constitutive apoptotic Mphi versus CTR, n = 8), and HS-dependent protection from apoptosis with and without serum depletion (48 h depletion: HS, +275 ± 37% apoptotic Mphi versus CTR, n = 6; full medium: +166 ± 62% versus CTR, n = 8, P < 0.05) was inferior. Conclusions. Impaired HSP72 stress response of Mphi in patients on haemodialysis might contribute to the observed immune dysfunction and, therefore, to the increased susceptibility to infection and malignancy. Stress impairment is not restricted to uraemia but is already present in a rat model of chronic kidney disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
