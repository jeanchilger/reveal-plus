We aimed at generating a non-functional mAb directed against NAG-2 from patients’ memory B cells. Direct and competitive ELISA methods have been used to evaluate the binding of antibodies from scleroderma patients’ and controls’ sera to the NAG-2 peptide. IgG memory B cells were sorted, EBV transformed and cloned to obtain NAG-2-specific mAbs. Endothelial cells and fibroblasts were cultured under standard conditions and used for functional assays. Anti-NAG-2-purified antibodies obtained from patients’ Ig induce endothelial cell apoptosis and fibroblast proliferation. Patients’ Igs depleted of the anti-NAG-2 fraction do not exert such functional activity. Therefore, the NAG-2 molecule represents a potential novel candidate for therapeutic intervention in SSc. Here, we describe the generation of a human mAb directed against the NAG-2 molecule. Such mAb does not retain any functional property and is able to block the effect of serum pathogenetic anti-NAG-2 antibodies. The majority of SSc patients present antibodies directed against tetraspanin NAG-2 and mediate both endothelial cell apoptosis and fibroblast proliferation, features of the disease. The anti-NAG-2 human mAb we have obtained blocks signal transduction and therefore may be a potential candidate for a new treatment in SSc, a disease where the current biological therapies have little or no efficacy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
