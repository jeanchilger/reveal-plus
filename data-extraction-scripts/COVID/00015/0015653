We detected human bocavirus (HBoV) infection in 4.5% of hospitalized patients with pneumonia in rural Thailand. However, the role of HBoV as a pathogen is unclear. Methods. We compared HBoV infection in patients with pneumonia with that in asymptomatic control patients enrolled between 1 September 2004 and 31 August 2005 in the same hospitals in Thailand.We examined outpatients with influenza-like illness for HBoV infection and tested for 13 additional respiratory viruses. Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of HBoV infection are described. Results. HBoV infection was detected in 20 (3.9%) of 512 outpatients and 3 (1%) of 280 control patients. Coinfection with other viruses was detected in 83% of patients with pneumonia and in 90% of outpatients. Compared with control patients, HBoV infection was significantly associated with pneumonia requiring hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio, 3.56 [95% confidence interval, 1.06–11.91]; P = .04). Eighty-three percent of HBoV infections were detected in patients with pneumonia who were <5 years old. More patients with pneumonia associated with HBoV—respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) coinfections had wheezing than patients with RSV and HPIV infections alone (9 [53%] of 17 vs. 32 [23%] of 138]; P = .01). Conclusions. HBoV infection was epidemiologically associated with pneumonia among young children in rural Thailand, but infection and illness may be dependent on coinfection with other viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
