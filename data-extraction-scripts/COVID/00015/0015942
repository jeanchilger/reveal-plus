The aim of this study was to determine the regional differences of influenza activity in Poland in the 2015/16 epidemic season. The influenza surveillance involved 16 administrative districts in which there are Voivodeship (province) Sanitary Epidemiological Stations set up to report influenza and influenza-like illness among the Polish population. Over 8000 specimens were tested in the season with regard to the respiratory viral infections in all regions investigated. The circulation of influenza viruses A and B was confirmed, with the subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 being predominant in the Pomerania, Podlaskie, Subcarpathian, Lubuskie, Silesian, and Warmian-Masuria provinces. The influenza-like virus occurred in individual cases, except for respiratory syncytial virus that also was detected in the Greater Poland and Warmia-Masuria provinces. The highest incidence of cases and suspected cases of influenza was recorded in Pomerania and the lowest one in Lubuskie provinces. The knowledge of regional differences in influenza activity is important for streamlining the distribution of preventive, therapeutic, and economic resources to combat the epidemic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
