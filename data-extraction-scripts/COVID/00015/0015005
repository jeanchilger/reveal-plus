METHODS: We studied the circulating levels of SP-D in 37 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to the A/H1N1 virus infection and in 40 healthy controls. Cox logistic regression models were constructed to explore the association of SP-D levels and risk of death. RESULTS: Mortality rate after a 28-day was 32.42 %. Significant higher levels of SP-D were detected in A/H1N1 patients with fatal outcome (p < 0.05). After adjusting for confounding variables, levels of SP-D ≥250 ng/mL were associated with increased the risk of death (HR = 8.27, 95 % CI 1.1–64.1, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that higher circulating levels of SP-D are associated with higher mortality risk in critically ill A/H1N1 patients. SP-D might be a predictive factor of poor outcomes in viral pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
