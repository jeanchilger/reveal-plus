The molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for glycyrrhizic acid were prepared by using bismethacryloyl-β-cyclodextrin and methacrylic acid as double functional monomers and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, thermo gravimetric analysis, nitrogen adsorption and elemental analysis. In aqueous media, the adsorption properties of MIPs including adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms and selectivity adsorption were investigated. The characterization of imprinted polymers indicated that the prepared MIPs had good stability and many cavity structures. The results of adsorption experiments illustrated the MIPs had high adsorption capacity of glycyrrhizic acid (69.3 mg g(−1)) with the imprinting factor 3.77, and it took ~5 min to get adsorption equilibrium. The MIPs could be used as an solid phase extraction sorbent absorbent for enrichment and purification of glycyrrhizic acid from the crude extraction of licorice roots, and the results showed promising practical value.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
