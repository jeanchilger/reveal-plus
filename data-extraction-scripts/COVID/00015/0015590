Posttranslational modification of proteins by ubiquitin plays an essential role in mediating or regulating the virus-triggered PRRs-mediated signaling. Deubiquitination is the reversible process of ubiquitination and its role in regulating PRRs-mediated signaling has recently been explored. In this review, we first summarize the ubiquitination events in PRRs-mediated signaling that is triggered by viral nucleic acid and then focus on host and viral deubiquitinating enzymes-mediated regulation of virus-triggered signaling that modulates the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB and subsequent induction of type I IFNs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
