<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2000-05-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Limited Transmission of Turkey Coronavirus in Young Turkeys by Adult Alphitobius diaperinus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)</TITLE><BODY>We examined the role of lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer), in the transmission of an enteric disease of turkeys caused by a coronavirus. Turkey coronavirus (TCV) from two sources was studied, one isolate (NC95) was embryo propagated, the second was TCV infected material from turkeys diagnosed with poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS). Beetles were fed virus-infected feces mixed with chicken feed. Transmission of virus was effectively halted by surface sterilization of the beetles. Turkey poults administered beetle homogenates infected with TCV+ PEMS that had not been surface sterilized had reduced weight gains and 50% mortality. Mortality and weight gains were not effected in the NC95 group. Virus isolation procedures were performed to determine NC95 viability at varying time intervals. Beetles were dissected and the guts removed 1, 12, and 24 h after the initial viral feeding. Whole beetles were also examined for comparison. Whole beetles and beetle guts were homogenized and injected into turkey eggs for embryo propagation. Direct immunofluorescence was used to determine the presence of TCV. A. diaperinus were capable of mechanical transmission of TCV. However, only turkey embryos receiving whole beetle and beetle gut homogenates within 1 h of feeding on the virus were positive for TCV. Laboratory studies demonstrating PEMS transmission by A. diaperinus are continuing.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
