<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-05-01</DATELINE><TITLE>FDA Perspectives on Diagnostic Device Clinical Studies for Respiratory Infections</TITLE><BODY>Two pathways are described for submission to FDA for clearance of a diagnostic device: a Premarket Application (PMA), which can lead to approval of a diagnostic device, and a Premarket Notification, which can lead to clearance. The latter is often called a 510(k), named for the statute providing for this path. Recent FDA clearance of molecular-based multiplex panels represents the beginning of a new era for the diagnosis of respiratory infections. The ability to test for multiple pathogens simultaneously, accompanied by the increasing availability of molecular-based assays for newly recognized respiratory pathogens will likely have a major impact on patient care, drug development, and public health epidemiology. We provide a general overview of how FDA evaluates new diagnostics for respiratory tract infections and the agency’s expectations for sponsors developing new tests in this area.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
