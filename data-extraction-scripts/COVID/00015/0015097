<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-09-28</DATELINE><TITLE>BrainStem Encephalitis Associated with Chandipura in Andhra Pradesh Outbreak</TITLE><BODY>Clinical data of 104 hospitalized children during the 2003 epidemic of encephalitis in Andhra Pradesh state was retrospectively analysed to know the clinical profile and risk factors associated with mortality. Fever was the first symptom associated with altered sensorium, seizures, diarrhoea and vomiting. Evolution of illness was very rapid with high fatality (47%). Majority of deaths occurred within the first 24 h of illness due to brainstem involvement. On multiple logistic regression analysis, high-grade fever, absent oculocephalic reflex and Glasgow coma score <7 were found to be significantly contributing to the mortality. Evidence of Chandipura virus was detected in these cases as the etiological agent.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
