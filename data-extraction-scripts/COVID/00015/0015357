<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-10-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Rare and Emerging Viral Infections in Transplant Recipients</TITLE><BODY>Emerging viral pathogens include newly discovered viruses as well as previously known viruses that are either increasing, or threatening to increase in incidence. While often first identified in the general population, they may affect transplant recipients, in whom their manifestations may be atypical or more severe. Enhanced molecular methods have increased the rate of viral discovery but have not overcome the problem of demonstrating pathogenicity. At the same time, improved clinical diagnostic methods have increased the detection of reemerging viruses in immunocompromised patients. In this review, we first discuss viral diagnostics and the developing field of viral discovery and then focus on rare and emerging viruses in the transplant population: human T-cell leukemia virus type 1; hepatitis E virus; bocavirus; KI and WU polyomaviruses; coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63; influenza, H1N1; measles; dengue; rabies; and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Detection and reporting of such rare pathogens in transplant recipients is critical to patient care and improving our understanding of posttransplant infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
