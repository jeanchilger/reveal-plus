<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-03-17</DATELINE><TITLE>Monoclonal Antibodies and Antibody Like Fragments Derived from Immunised Phage Display Libraries</TITLE><BODY>Morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases are always on the rise, especially in poorer countries and in the aging population. The inevitable, but unpredictable emergence of new infectious diseases has become a global threat. HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the more recent H1N1 influenza are only a few of the numerous examples of emerging infectious diseases in the modern era. However despite advances in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, there is need for more specific, efficacious, cost-effective and less toxic treatment and preventive drugs. In this chapter, we discuss a powerful combinatorial technology in association with animal immunisation that is capable of generating biologic drugs with high affinity, efficacy and limited off-site toxicity, and diagnostic tools with great precision. Although time consuming, immunisation still remains the preferred route for the isolation of high-affinity antibodies and antibody-like fragments. Phage display is a molecular diversity technology that allows the presentation of large peptide and protein libraries on the surface of filamentous phage. The selection of binding fragments from phage display libraries has proven significant for routine isolation of invaluable peptides, antibodies, and antibody-like domains for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Here we highlight the many benefits of combining immunisation with phage display in combating infectious diseases, and how our knowledge of antibody engineering has played a crucial role in fully exploiting these platforms in generating therapeutic and diagnostic biologics towards antigenic targets of infectious organisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
