To understand the pathogenesis, we studied viral replication, cytokine/chemokine response, and antigen presentation in MERS-CoV–infected human monocyte–derived macrophages (MDMs) versus SARS-CoV–infected MDMs. Only MERS-CoV can replicate in MDMs. Both viruses were unable to significantly stimulate the expression of antiviral cytokines (interferon α [IFN-α] and IFN-β) but induced comparable levels of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 6. Notably, MERS-CoV induced significantly higher expression levels of interleukin 12, IFN-γ, and chemokines (IP-10/CXCL-10, MCP-1/CCL-2, MIP-1α/CCL-3, RANTES/CCL-5, and interleukin 8) than SARS-CoV. The expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and costimulatory molecules were significantly higher in MERS-CoV–infected MDMs than in SARS-CoV–infected cells. MERS-CoV replication was validated by immunostaining of infected MDMs and ex vivo lung tissue. We conclusively showed that MERS-CoV can establish a productive infection in human macrophages. The aberrant induction of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines could be important in the disease pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
