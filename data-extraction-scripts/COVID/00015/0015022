A number of studies have sought to identify the ideal choice of antibiotics, route of administration and optimum duration of treatment based on the most likely aetiological agents. Emerging bacterial resistance to antibiotics is also an important consideration in treatment. However, inconsistent clinical and radiological definitions of pneumonia make comparison between studies difficult. There is also a lack of well designed adequately powered randomised controlled trials. This review describes the difficulties encountered in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia, aetiology, treatment strategies with recommendations and highlights areas for further research.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
