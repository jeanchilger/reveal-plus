However, the analysis of next-generation sequencing data might be challenging for researchers who have never approached the study of viral quasispecies by this methodology. In this work we present a suitable and affordable guide to explore the sub-consensus variability and to reconstruct viral quasispecies from Illumina sequencing data. The guide includes a complete analysis pipeline along with user-friendly descriptions of software and file formats. In addition, we assessed the feasibility of the workflow proposed by analyzing a set of foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDV) with different degrees of variability. This guide introduces the analysis of quasispecies of FMDV and other viruses through this kind of approach.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
