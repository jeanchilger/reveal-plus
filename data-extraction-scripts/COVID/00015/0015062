Miniaturization initially focused on devices that contained micrometer-sized features designed for a particular analytical purpose (e.g., filters for cell isolation and chips for capillary electrophoresis). Now, the focus is shifting to analytical applications based on nano-sized objects such as nanotubes, nanochannels, nanoparticles, nanopores and nanocapacitors. These nanofabricated objects provide new tools for sequencing of nucleic acids and rapid, multiplexed, nucleic acid detection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
