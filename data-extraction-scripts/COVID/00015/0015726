<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-12-01</DATELINE><TITLE>The impact of genomics on public health practice</TITLE><BODY>INTRODUCTION: Genomic science is developing rapidly, and engagement of public health professionals will be necessary to appraise new technologies and use them effectively. SOURCES OF DATA: We use established domains of public health and draw on the literature and expert knowledge to illustrate how genomic technologies give rise to new applications. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Genomic technologies are useful in rare inherited disease, including population screening programmes, in health care and for surveillance, diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: It is less clear when and how genetic susceptibility testing will be used for common chronic disease prevention or protection from environmental hazards. GROWING POINTS: Developments in public health practice will be necessary to ensure rapid and effective implementation of genomic science. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Public health researchers should address how to accelerate the implementation of genomics for health benefit in developed and developing countries.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
