To clarify the phylogenetic relationship between SARS CoV and other coronaviruses, we compiled a large data set composed of 7 concatenated protein sequences and performed comprehensive analyses, using the maximum-likelihood, Bayesian-inference, and maximum-parsimony methods. All resulting phylogenetic trees displayed an identical topology and supported the hypothesis that the relationship between SARS CoV and group 2 CoVs is monophyletic. Relationships among all major groups were well resolved and were supported by all statistical analyses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
