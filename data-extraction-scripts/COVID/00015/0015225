It allows public health protection measures such as contact tracing and isolation to be put in place. This study aimed to find the most appropriate surveillance method for a disease like SARS. Existing surveillance methods were evaluated against a set of new criteria in a qualitative manner. Influenza and tuberculosis (TB) surveillance were used as models. A literature search was undertaken to find relevant evidence. The results show that TB surveillance is more appropriate than influenza surveillance as a model because it is more complete in its reporting. Clinician‐based reporting is better than laboratory‐based because it is more timely. The results suggest a clinician‐based notification system would be the most appropriate form of surveillance for a disease like SARS for public health purposes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
