In winter, both small round structured virus (SRSV, or Norwalk-like viruses) and rotavirus were detected from infants with gastroenteritis; however, in recent years, the prevailing time of SRSV infection has preceded that of rotavirus infection. Most nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks were related to SRSV infection, and >60% of the outbreaks were caused by contaminated food. In small-sized outbreaks, raw oysters were the primary source of transmission. In large-sized outbreaks, school lunches and catered meals that were served at schools, banquet halls, and hospitals were most often implicated in the transmission of foodborne gastroenteritis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
