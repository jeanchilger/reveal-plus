External quality control is needed. Methods: We have conducted an international quality assurance study on WNV molecular detection. Participating laboratories tested noninfectious samples inactivated by heat and gamma irradiation. Participants received 7 coded lyophilized samples containing WNV of genetic lineages 1a, 1b, and 2 at 2600 to 18 000 000 RNA copies/mL, 3 samples containing heterologous flaviviruses, and 2 negative samples. Results: Thirty laboratories participated. The average laboratory achieved 50% detection probability from 7762 copies/mL onward (probit analysis; 95% CI = 1174–24547 copies/mL). Lineages 1a and 1b were detected with equal efficiencies, but the lineage 2 strain (Ug37) was detected at significantly lower rates. Only 27% of participants were able to detect the 6 samples containing ≥1.8 × 10(4) copies/mL. Three laboratories generated false-positive results in negative samples. Six of 30 laboratories reported correct strain identification in 3 samples containing non-WNV flaviviruses. We observed a significant positive correlation between the capability of detecting non-WNV flaviviruses and detecting WNV lineage 2. Conclusions: Most participants showed good performance in detecting lineage 1 WNV, the predominant virus in the Northern Hemisphere. The inability of some laboratories to detect even highly concentrated lineage 2 WNV downgraded the overall outcome. The lineage 2 material received through this study will provide laboratories with the necessary template for improving their assays. Such material is otherwise hard to obtain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
