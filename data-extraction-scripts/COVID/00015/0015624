The mean concentration (± the standard error) of insoluble fibrin (measured as D-dimer) in subjects with rhinovirus colds increased from a baseline level of 0.8 ± 0.4 µg/mL to a peak of 2.4 ± 0.7 µg/mL (P = .0008) on day 4 after inoculation of the virus, but the fibrin concentration remained at baseline levels in the 4 uninfected control subjects.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
