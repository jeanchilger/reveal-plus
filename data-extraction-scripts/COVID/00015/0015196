Lewis rats were fed diets containing 80 g of SDAP/kg diet, 22.7 g of IC/kg diet, or milk proteins (Control diet) from postnatal d 21 (weaning) for 14 d. On d 30 and 33, rats were given SEB (0.5 mg/kg body weight; i.p.). Organized gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) populations, intestinal secretion, mucosal and serum immunoglobulin concentrations, and neutrophil infiltration were studied. On d 35, blood was collected under anesthesia and samples of intestinal mucosa, Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and spleen were taken. SEB increased the water content of feces, which was prevented by diets containing either SDAP (P < 0.002) or IC (P < 0.001), indicating that plasma protein–supplemented diets can reverse the SEB-induced secretory response. In Peyer's patches, the diet containing SDAP partially prevented the SEB-induced increase in T lymphocytes (P < 0.1) and reduced the percentage of activated T helper cells (P < 0.05). In MLN, activated T lymphocytes were increased by SEB but they were not affected by diet. No effects of SEB or dietary supplementation on mucosal IgA and serum IgA and IgG were observed. The effects of SDAP supplementation on the lymphocyte populations of GALT in rats challenged with SEB support the view that SDAP can modulate the immune response and suggest that plasma protein supplementation can prevent GALT from possible activation by luminal bacterial superantigens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
