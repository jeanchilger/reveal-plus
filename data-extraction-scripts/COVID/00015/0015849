Vaccines have reduced the incidence of JE in some countries, but no specific antiviral therapy is currently available. The NS3 protein of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a multifunctional protein combining protease, helicase and nucleoside 5′-triphosphatase (NTPase) activities. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of this protein has recently been solved using a roentgenographic method. This enabled structure-based virtual screening for novel inhibitors of JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase. The aim of the present research was to identify novel potent medicinal substances for the treatment of JE. In the first step of studies, the natural ligand ATP and two known JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase inhibitors were docked to their molecular target. The refined structure of the enzyme was used to construct a pharmacophore model for JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase inhibitors. The freely available ZINC database of lead-like compounds was then screened for novel inhibitors. About 1 161 000 compounds have been screened and 15 derivatives of the highest scores have been selected. These compounds were docked to the JEV NS3 helicase/NTPase to examine their binding mode and verify screening results by consensus scoring procedure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
