Although none of the SARS-CoV proteins was found to be directly bound to HAb18G/CD147, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV was bound to CyPA, which interacted with HAb18G/CD147. Further research showed that HAb18G/CD147, a transmembrane molecule, was highly expressed on 293 cells and that CyPA was integrated with SARS-CoV. HAb18G/CD147–antagonistic peptide (AP)–9, an AP of HAb18G/CD147, had a high rate of binding to 293 cells and an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV. These results show that HAb18G/CD147, mediated by CyPA bound to SARS-CoV N protein, plays a functional role in facilitating invasion of host cells by SARS-CoV. Our findings provide some evidence for the cytologic mechanism of invasion by SARS-CoV and provide a molecular basis for screening anti-SARS drugs&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
