<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-09-15</DATELINE><TITLE>The Value That Infectious Diseases Physicians Bring to the Healthcare System</TITLE><BODY>While a career in infectious diseases (ID) has always been challenging and exciting, recognition of the value that ID physicians provide to the healthcare system as a whole, over and above the value they provide to individual patients, has been poor in this system. In response to this disparity, the Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical Affairs Committee has long endeavored to quantify the value of ID physicians to the system, which is challenging in part because of the many avenues through which they influence healthcare. We discuss data showing that ID physicians improve clinical outcomes, positively impact transitions of care, and direct system-level improvements through infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship. We identify areas where value-based care provides additional future opportunities for ID physicians. A Clinical Affairs Committee–sponsored study of ID physicians’ positive impact on patient outcomes shows that few medical specialties are better positioned to positively impact the Triple Aim approach—better health, better care, and lower per capita cost—that is the principle tenet of healthcare system reform.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
