The characteristic mononuclear leukocyte infiltration in the lung and the high inflammatory response in H5N1 infection prompted us to compare the chemokine responses between influenza virus–infected adult and neonatal monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The effects of avian influenza virus A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1) (H5N1/97), its precursor A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2) (H9N2/G1), and human influenza virus A/Hong Kong/54/98 (H1N1) (H1N1/98) were compared. Significantly higher expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10 was induced by avian influenza viruses than by human influenza virus. Moreover, the increase in CCL3 expression in H5N1/97-infected adult MDMs was significantly higher than that in neonatal MDMs. Enhanced expression of CCR1 and CCR5 was found in avian virus–infected adult MDMs. The strong induction of chemokines and their receptors by avian influenza viruses, particularly in adult MDMs, may account for the severity of H5N1 disease&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
