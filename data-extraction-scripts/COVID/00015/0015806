The potential emergence of a new pandemic strain (eg, avian influenza virus) is a major concern. Currently available vaccines and anti-influenza drugs have limited effectiveness for influenza virus infections, especially for new pandemic strains. Therefore, there is an acute need to develop alternative strategies for influenza therapy. γδ T cells have potent antiviral activities against different viruses, but no data are available concerning their antiviral activity against influenza viruses MethodsIn this study, we used virus-infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to examine the antiviral activity of phosphoantigen isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP)–expanded human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells against influenza viruses ResultsVγ9Vδ2 T cells were selectively activated and expanded by IPP from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IPP-expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells efficiently killed MDMs infected with human (H1N1) or avian (H9N2 or H5N1) influenza virus and significantly inhibited viral replication. The cytotoxicity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells against influenza virus–infected MDMs was dependent on NKG2D activation and was mediated by Fas–Fas ligand and perforin–granzyme B pathways ConclusionOur findings suggest a potentially novel therapeutic approach to seasonal, zoonotic avian, and pandemic influenza—the use of phosphoantigens to activate γδ T cells against influenza virus infections&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
