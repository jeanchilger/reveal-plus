Patient characteristics and frequencies of RV in nasal specimens were analyzed, by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at asthma-related hospital admission and at a 3-month convalescent follow-up visit ResultsRV was detected by RT-PCR in 21% of hospitalized patients over a 4-year period and in 1.3% of patients who returned for a 3-month follow-up visit. RV detection was strongly associated with hospitalization for asthma (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 15.1 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.88–121.4]). After adjustment for baseline asthma severity, RV-positive patients were more likely than RV-negative patients to be current smokers and nonusers of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) (adjusted OR, 11.18 [95% CI, 2.37–52.81]; P=.002) ConclusionsRV respiratory infection is an etiologic agent in severe asthma exacerbations necessitating hospitalization in adults. Compared with hospitalized patients with asthma who were RV negative, RV-positive patients were significantly more likely to be smokers and nonusers of ICSs&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
