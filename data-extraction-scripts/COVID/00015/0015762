The platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor, which is a receptor for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, is upregulated by RSV infection in the pulmonary epithelial cell line A549. Fosfomycin, an antimicrobial agent, significantly suppressed PAF receptor induction by RSV infection at the mRNA and cell surface expression levels. Fosfomycin also suppressed RSV-induced adhesion of fluorescence-labeled S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae cells, as determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. The RSV-induced bacterial adhesion was suggested to be host-PAF-receptor and bacterial-phosphocholine mediated. Fosfomycin, which has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, was found here to suppress adhesion by disease-causing bacteria. Thus, fosfomycin might prevent secondary bacterial infection during RSV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
