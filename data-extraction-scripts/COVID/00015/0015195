METHODS: Hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients with respiratory symptoms and LRT and URT RV testing via multiplex PCR from 2009 to 2016 were included. Logistic regression models were used to analyze risk factors for LRT RV detection. RESULTS: Two-hundred thirty-five HCT candidates or recipients had URT and LRT RV testing within 3 days. Among 115 subjects (49%) positive for a RV, 37% (42 of 115) had discordant sample pairs. Forty percent (17 of 42) of discordant pairs were positive in the LRT but negative in the URT. Discordance was common for adenovirus (100%), metapneumovirus (44%), rhinovirus (34%), and parainfluenza virus type 3 (28%); respiratory syncytial virus was highly concordant (92%). Likelihood of LRT detection was increased with URT detection (oods ratio [OR] = 73.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.7–204) and in cytomegalovirus-positive recipients (OR = 3.70; 95% CI, 1.30–10.0). CONCLUSIONS: High rates of discordance were observed for certain RVs. Bronchoalveolar lavage sampling may provide useful diagnostic information to guide management in symptomatic HCT candidates and recipients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
