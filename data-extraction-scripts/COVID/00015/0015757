<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-12-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Fifty-Five Years of International Epidemic-Assistance Investigations Conducted by CDC’s Disease Detectives</TITLE><BODY>For more than 60 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has used its scientific expertise to help people throughout the world live healthier, safer, longer lives through science-based health action. In 1951, CDC officially established the Epidemic Intelligence Service to help build public health capacity. During 1950–2005, CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service officers conducted 462 international epidemiologic field investigations in 131 foreign countries and 7 territories. Investigations have included responding to emerging infectious and noninfectious disease outbreaks, assisting in disaster response, and evaluating core components of public health programs worldwide. Approximately 81% of investigations were responses to infectious disease outbreaks, but the proportion of investigations related to chronic and other noninfectious conditions increased 7-fold (6%–45%). These investigations have contributed to detecting and characterizing new pathogens (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus) and conditions, provided insights regarding factors that cause or contribute to disease acquisition (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), led to development of new diagnostics and surveillance technologies, and provided information upon which global health policies and regulations can be based. CDC’s disease detectives will undoubtedly continue to play a critical role in global health and in responding to emerging global disease threats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
