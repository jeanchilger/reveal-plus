A Review</TITLE><BODY>Pathogenic RNA viruses are potentially the most important group involved in zoonotic disease transmission, and they represent a challenge for global disease control. Their biological diversity and rapid adaptive rates have proved to be difficult to overcome and to anticipate by modern medical technology. Also, the anthropogenic change of natural ecosystems and the continuous population growth are driving increased rates of interspecies contacts and the interchange of pathogens that can develop into global pandemics. The combination of molecular, epidemiological, and ecological knowledge of RNA viruses is therefore essential towards the proper control of these emergent pathogens. This review outlines, throughout different levels of complexity, the problems posed by RNA viral diseases, covering some of the molecular mechanisms allowing them to adapt to new host species—and to novel pharmaceutical developments—up to the known ecological processes involved in zoonotic transmission.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
