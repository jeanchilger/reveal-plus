Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify influenza C RNA fragments from clinical specimens. Two hundred otherwise healthy adults with recent onset of a common cold were studied. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected at entry to the study and 1 week later. Serum samples for antibody determinations were obtained at the first visit and after 3 weeks. Influenza C was detected in 7 of the 200 patients by 2 different RT-PCR formats. All 7 patients had a significant increase in antibody titers between serum samples collected during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. Influenza C appears to be one of the many viruses that cause acute upper respiratory tract infections in adults&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
