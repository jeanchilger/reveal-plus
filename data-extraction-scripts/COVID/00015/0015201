<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1999-12-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Nidovirus Infections: Experimental Model Systems of Human Neurologic Diseases</TITLE><BODY>The presence of terminally differentiated slow- and non-dividing cells in the central nervous system (CNS) provides a safe harbor for viral persistence and latency and constitutes a unique immunologic environment for viral infections. Studies of experimental model systems of viral infections of the CNS provide insight into mechanisms of viral persistence and immune-mediated pathology. Nidoviruses are comprised of 2 families of viruses, coronaviruses and arteriviruses, and are common pathogens of humans and a variety of animal species. Both families of viruses contain neurotropic strains that produce experimental neurologic diseases in rodents. These include acute meningitis and encephalitis; acute poliomyelitis; and chronic inflammatory, immune-mediated, demyelination. Coronavirus-induced demyelinating disease mimics many of the pathologic features of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
