<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Human Metapneumovirus: A New Player among Respiratory Viruses</TITLE><BODY>The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a newly described member of the Paramyxoviridae family belonging to the Metapneumovirus genus. Since its initial description in 2001, hMPV has been reported in most parts of the world and isolated from the respiratory tract of subjects from all age groups. Despite the fact that prospective and case-control studies have been limited, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations associated with hMPV have been found to be reminiscent of those of the human respiratory syncytial virus, with most severe respiratory tract infections occurring in infants, elderly subjects, and immunocompromised hosts. Additional research is needed to define the pathogenesis of this viral infection and the host's specific immune response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
