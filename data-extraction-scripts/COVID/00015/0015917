<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-05-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Emergence of avian infectious bronchitis in a non-vaccinating country</TITLE><BODY>Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus of the chicken. It is a highly contagious pathogen and in addition to causing respiratory and kidney diseases can affect the reproductive organs, resulting in loss of production and poor egg quality. Despite the global distribution of IBV, Finland has been free of clinical cases for almost three decades. Since April 2011, outbreaks involving genotypes QX, D274-like and 4/91-like have occurred in southern Finland. The clinical samples studied were submitted to the Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira from different regions of Finland during 2011 to 2013 and originated from a voluntary health monitoring programme, a national survey for avian influenza and diagnostic specimens from both commercial poultry production and hobby flocks. The sources of the infections are not known, but strains D274 and 4/91 are widely used in vaccines elsewhere.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
