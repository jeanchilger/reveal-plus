<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Issues Related to the Use of Animals in Biocontainment Research Facilities</TITLE><BODY>The expansion and improvement of high-containment animal facilities has been driven by terrorism, economics, the emergence of new pathogens, and the re-emergence of other pathogens in new areas. Working with highly infectious viral agents requires a team of trained scientists, laboratory technicians, veterinarians, animal care staff, biological safety officers, engineers, and physical plant staff to ensure safety, biocontainment, and the animals' well being, while providing essential scientific data. The challenges of working with infectious disease agents in high levels of containment, and some solutions to these challenges, are described from an animal care point of view.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
