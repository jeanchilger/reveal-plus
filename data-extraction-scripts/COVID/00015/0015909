To examine this, the complete genomic sequences of the two subpopulations of the VicS vaccine, VicS-v and VicS-del, were determined. Compared with VicS-v, the more attenuated VicS-del strain had two non-synonymous changes in the non-structural protein 6 (nsp6), a transmembrane (TM) domain that may participate in autocatalytic release of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, a polymorphic difference at the end of the S2 gene, which coincided with the body transcription-regulating sequence (B-TRS) of mRNA 3 and a truncated open reading frame for a peptide encoded by gene 4 (4b). These genetic differences could be responsible for the differences between these variants in pathogenicity in vivo, and replication in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome showed that VicS-v and VicS-del did not cluster with strains from other countries, supporting the hypothesis that Australian IBV strains have been evolving independently for some time, and analyses of individual polymerase peptide and S glycoprotein genes suggested a distant common ancestor with no recent recombination. This study suggests the potential role of the TM domain in nsp6, the integrity of the S2 protein and the B-TRS 3, and the putative accessory protein 4b, as well as the 3′ untranslated region, in the virulence and replication of IBV and has provided a better understanding of relationships between the Australian vaccine strain of IBV and those used elsewhere.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
