We evaluated presatovir in hematopoietic-cell transplant (HCT) recipients with RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: Patients with confirmed RSV in upper and lower respiratory tract and new chest X-ray abnormalities were randomized (1:1), stratified by supplemental oxygen and ribavirin use, to receive oral presatovir 200 mg or placebo every 4 days for 5 doses. The primary endpoint was time-weighted average change in nasal RSV viral load through day 9. Secondary endpoints included supplemental oxygen-free days, incident respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: From January 31, 2015, to March 20, 2017, 60 patients from 17 centers were randomized (31 presatovir, 29 placebo); 59 received study treatment (50 allogeneic, 9 autologous HCT). In the efficacy population (29 presatovir, 28 placebo), presatovir treatment did not significantly reduce time-weighted average change in viral load (−1.12 vs −1.09 log(10) copies/mL; treatment difference −0.02 log(10) copies/mL, 95% confidence interval: −.62, .57; P = .94), median supplemental oxygen-free days (26 vs 28 days, P = .84), incident respiratory failure (10.3 vs 10.7%, P = .98), or all-cause mortality (0 vs 7.1%, P = .19) versus placebo. Adverse events were similar between arms (presatovir 80%, placebo 79%). Resistance-associated substitutions in RSV fusion protein emerged in 6/29 presatovir-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Presatovir treatment was well tolerated in HCT patients with RSV LRTI but did not improve virologic or clinical outcomes versus placebo.
