Recently, the large 386-nucleotide deletion (L386del) comprising nucleotide positions 27719-28104 and spanning open reading frames 9–11 has been reported in the genomes of some human isolates from Hong Kong. In this study, archived specimens from 71 patients with SARS who were admitted to the New Territory East Cluster Hospitals in Hong Kong were analyzed to determine whether the L386del variant of SARS-CoV was present. There was no clear relationship between the presence of the L386del variant and SARS clinical severity as defined either by the need for intensive-care therapy and/or ventilation or by death. One patient had evidence of both the L386del variant and the wild-type variant in the same clinical specimen, supporting the idea that SARS-CoV exists as a quasispecies in some patients, although the clinical significance of these quasispecies remains unclear&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
