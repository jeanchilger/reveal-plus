However, the expression and regulatory mechanisms of serum CEACAM1 in gastrointestinal cancer are still unclear. The expression ratio of the CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S isoforms has seldom been investigated in gastrointestinal cancer. In this study, we intended to explore the expression and diagnostic value of CEACAM1 in gastrointestinal cancer. Serum CEACAM1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The protein expression and distribution of CEACAM1 in tumors were examined by immunohistochemical staining. The expression patterns and ratio of CEACAM1-L/S were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that serum CEACAM1 levels were significantly higher in cancer patients than in healthy controls. CEACAM1 was found in secreted forms within the neoplastic glands, and its expression was more intense at the tumor invasion front. The CEACAM1-L/S (L:S) ratios were up-regulated during tumorigenesis. Our data suggest that the serum level of CEACAM1 may be used to discriminate gastrointestinal cancer patients from health controls.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
