The global conformation of these structures is defined by a variety of constituent structural units such as helices, hairpin loops, kissing-loop motifs and pseudoknots, which often behave in a modular way. Their ubiquitous distribution is associated with a variety of functions in biological processes. The location of these structures in the genomes of RNA viruses is often coordinated with specific processes in the viral life cycle, where the presence of the structure acts as a checkpoint for deciding the eventual fate of the process. These structures have been found to adopt complex conformations and exert their effects by interacting with ribosomes, multiple host translation factors and small RNA molecules like miRNA. A number of such RNA structures have also been shown to regulate translation in viruses at the level of initiation, elongation or termination. The role of various computational studies in the preliminary identification of such sequences and/or structures and subsequent functional analysis has not been fully appreciated. This review aims to summarize the processes in which viral RNA structures have been found to play an active role in translational regulation, their global conformational features and the bioinformatics/computational tools available for the identification and prediction of these structures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
