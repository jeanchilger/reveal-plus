Here, we performed long-term retrospective surveillance of hMPV infection among patients hospitalized in South Korea between 2007 and 2016 and investigated seasonal dynamics and clinical characteristics associated with each virus subtype/genotype. METHODS: Patient specimens were tested for hMPV and other respiratory viruses by commercial molecular assays. Medical records of hMPV-positive patients were reviewed, and hMPV subtype/genotype analysis was performed. We also collected meteorological data and analyzed relationships with hMPV activity. RESULTS: Of 23 694 specimens, 1275 (5.4%) were positive; among them, 94.0% were classified into 5 subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, B1, and B2). Some clinical manifestations differed according to hMPV genotype; however, there was no correlation between hMPV subtype and clinical outcome. Viral activity peaked at 13–20 weeks (April and May) and was associated with climate-specific factors, including temperature, relative humidity, diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale, 10-year study provides valuable information about the clinical characteristics associated with hMPV subtypes and climate factors contributing to virus transmission.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
