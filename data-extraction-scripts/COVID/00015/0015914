Driven by the motivation to develop a broadly permissive cell line for infection with a wide range of viruses, we identified a set of the most relevant host receptors involved in viral attachment and entry. This identification was done through a review of different viral entry pathways and host cell lines, and in the context of the Baltimore classification of viruses. In addition, we indicated the potential technical problems and proposed some solutions regarding how to modify the host cell genome in order to meet industrial requirements for mass production of antiviral vaccines. Our work contributes to a finer understanding of the importance of breaking the host–virus recognition specificities for the possibility of creating a cell line feasible for the production of vaccines against a broad spectrum of viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
