<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-10-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Microarray Detection of Human Parainfluenzavirus 4 Infection Associated with Respiratory Failure in an Immunocompetent Adult</TITLE><BODY>A pan-viral DNA microarray, the Virochip (University of California, San Francisco), was used to detect human parainfluenzavirus 4 (HPIV-4) infection in an immunocompetent adult presenting with a life-threatening acute respiratory illness. The virus was identified in an endotracheal aspirate specimen, and the microarray results were confirmed by specific polymerase chain reaction and serological analysis for HPIV-4. Conventional clinical laboratory testing using an extensive panel of microbiological tests failed to yield a diagnosis. This case suggests that the potential severity of disease caused by HPIV-4 in adults may be greater than previously appreciated and illustrates the clinical utility of a microarray for broad-based viral pathogen screening.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
