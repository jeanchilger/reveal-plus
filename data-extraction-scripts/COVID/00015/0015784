CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels were reduced in 100% of patients, CD8(+) T lymphocyte levels were reduced in 87%, B lymphocyte levels were reduced in 76%, and natural killer cell levels were reduced in 55%. Our data suggested that these patients' immune systems were impaired during the course of SARS. The absolute counts of lymphocyte subsets demonstrated a clinical significance for patients with SARS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
