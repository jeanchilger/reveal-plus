However, the target cells of SARS viral infection have not been characterized in detail. We report the pathologic findings of the lung in 3 cases of SARS. Chest radiographs at 2 to 3 weeks of infection revealed an atypical pneumonia with pulmonary consolidation, a clinical characteristic of SARS infection. The presence of the SARS virus was determined by nested reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the infected cells were identified by in situ hybridization in open-lung biopsy and postmortem necropsy specimens. Expression of SARS virus–encoded RNA was detected in all 3 cases by RT-PCR, and the SARS viral signal was localized in pneumocytes by using in situ hybridization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
