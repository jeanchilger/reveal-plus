Here we provide evidence that BW001, a C-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, induces anti-CVB3 activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In parallel, we have demonstrated that BW001 induces human PBMCs to express mRNAs of multiple types of interferon (IFN), including IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ω and IFN-γ, and to express mRNAs of at least 11 subtypes of IFN-α. The induced IFNs may contribute to the anti-CVB3 activity. The results suggest that BW001 could be developed into a medication with the potential to treat CVB3 infectious diseases by inducing natural mixed IFNs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
