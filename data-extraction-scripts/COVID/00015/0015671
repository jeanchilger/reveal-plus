<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1980-03-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Effect of Viral Infections on Pulmonary Function in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases</TITLE><BODY>The effect of 100 separate viral infections of the respiratory tract on pulmonary function was evaluated prospectively over an eight-year period in 84 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and in eight normal subjects. Some viral infections were associated with small acute declines in forced vital capacity and/or 1-sec forced expiratory volume of 25–300 ml. These declines were detectable only during the 90-day period after infection. The greatest abnormalities of pulmonary function followed infections with influenza virus, and the mean acute changes in I-sec forced expiratory volume (- 118.5 ml) were significantly greater than expected (- 15.2 ml; P = 0.03). Smaller, statistically insignificant declines followed infections with parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, and no changes were detectable after infections with coronavirus, herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Long-term effects of influenza or other viral infections on the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were not detected in this study population.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
