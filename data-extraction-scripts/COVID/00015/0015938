In this study, we demonstrated that CPE can be analyzed using an FRET-based ATP probe named ATP indicator based on Epsilon subunit for Analytical Measurements (ATeam). The results revealed that as early as 3 hr, the virus infected cells showed a significantly different Venus/cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) ratio compared to the mock-infected cells. The ATeam technology is therefore useful to determine the early signs of ATP-based CPE as early as 3 hr without morphology-based CPE by light microscopy, and enables high throughput determination of the presence of microorganisms in neglected samples stored in laboratories.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
