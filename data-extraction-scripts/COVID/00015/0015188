We used blood gas analysis and HPLC to determine whether bacterial fermentation might contribute to acidosis in diarrheic calves. Diarrheic calves (n = 21) had significantly lower pH, PCO(2), HCO(3)(−) and a higher anion gap than healthy calves (n = 21). Serum concentrations (mean ± SD, mmol/L) of DL-,L- and D-lactate were also significantly higher in diarrheic (8.9 ± 5.1, 4.1 ± 3.4 and 5.2 ± 5.7) than in healthy calves (1.7 ± 1.2, 2.0 ± 1.1 and too low to quantify). D- and L-lactate accounted for 64% anion gap increase in diarrheic calves. Fecal D- and L-lactate concentrations were also significantly higher in diarrheic calves (9.4 ± 3.0 and 11.9 ± 2.7 mmol/L) than healthy calves (1.1 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.1 mmol/L). The elevated concentrations of serum and fecal D-lactate suggest gut bacterial fermentation contributes to the development of acidosis in diarrhea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
