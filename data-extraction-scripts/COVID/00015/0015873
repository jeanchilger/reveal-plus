The display of single cytotoxic epitope on the surface of the virion is sufficient to induce priming and sustain long-term major histocompatibility complex class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes response in vivo. The filamentous bacteriophage is a versatile carrier able to display simultaneously either single or multiple epitopes and can elicit a cellular response carrying very little peptide (<1.5 µg).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
