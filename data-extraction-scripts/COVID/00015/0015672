<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-11-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Diagnostic Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Kit for Filoviruses Based on the Strain Collections of all European Biosafety Level 4 Laboratories</TITLE><BODY>A network of European biosafety level 4 laboratories has designed the first industry-standard molecular assay for all filoviruses species, based on the strain collections of all participants. It uses 5 optimized L gene primers and 3 probes, as well as an internal control with a separate detection probe. Detection limits (probit analysis, 95% detection chance) were as follows: Zaire ebolavirus, 487 copies/mL of plasma; Sudan ebolavirus Maleo, 586 copies/mL; Sudan ebolavirus Gulu, 1128 copies/mL; Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus, 537 copies/mL; Reston ebolavirus, 4546 copies/mL; Lake Victoria marburgvirus Musoke, 860 copies/mL; and Lake Victoria marburgvirus Ravn, 1551 copies/mL. The assay facilitates reliable detection or exclusion screening of filovirus infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
