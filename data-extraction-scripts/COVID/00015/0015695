IgG antibody and NAb titers were highly correlated, peaking at month 4 after the onset of disease and decreasing thereafter. IgG antibodies remained detectable in all patients until month 16, and they became undetectable in 11.8% of patients at month 24. The finding that NAbs remained detectable throughout follow-up is reassuring in terms of protection provided against reinfection; however, NAb titers decreased markedly after month 16&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
