By studying the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types A, B, DR, and DQ alleles in 90 Chinese patients with serologically confirmed SARS infections, we identified a strong association between HLA-B*0703 (OR, 4.08; 95% CI, 2.03–8.18; P = .00072 [Bonferroni-corrected P value, P(c)<.0022]) and -DRB1*0301 (OR, 0.06; 95%, 0.01–0.47; P = .00008 [after Bonferroni correction, P<.0042]) and the development of SARS. Moreover, the frequency of B*0703 and B60 coinheritance (9.6%; 95% CI, 4.6%–19.0%) in our SARS group was significantly higher (P = 3×10(−9)) than that expected in the general population (0.4%). These genetic data will critically affect both the study of the pathogenesis of SARS and the design of vaccination programs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
