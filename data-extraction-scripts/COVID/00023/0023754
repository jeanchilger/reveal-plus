<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-05-28</DATELINE><TITLE>An Oral Vaccine for TGEV Immunization of Pigs</TITLE><BODY>Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a commercially important pathogen of hog farms and causes contagious, lethal diarrhea in piglets. While orally and parenterally administered vaccines made from inactivated or attenuated TGEV are commercially available, they require individual administration to piglets, which is time and labor intensive, and run the risk of reversion to pathogenicity. Also, parenteral vaccines produce neutralizing serum antibodies which may be less effective against an orally transmitted pathogen, compared to an oral vaccine that would induce the production of mucosal antibodies. There has been an effort to produce subunit vaccines in an edible form in plants for convenient administration through feed. These efforts towards the expression of the S-antigen of TGEV in maize seed, its effectiveness at inducing neutralizing antibody production in the colostrum of gilts, and its efficacy in protecting piglets against challenge by virulent TGEV are summarized here.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
