<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-02-22</DATELINE><TITLE>George Fu Gao: the past and future of Ebola</TITLE><BODY>Newly returned from the frontline of the battle against Ebola in West Africa, Dr George Fu Gao talked to NSR on this largest Ebola epidemic in history. As Deputy Director-General of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), an Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), Dr Gao has been personally involved in the fight against acute infectious diseases both on the laboratory bench and in the field for many years. Recalling the sight of an Ebola-infected young man stumbling to his death on the street and observing the continuing climb of patient statistics, he anxiously calls for larger global help to affected countries. The help provided by the world community to West Africa was ‘too late and insufficient’, and in this age of globalization ‘no country can care only for herself alone’. In this interview, Dr Gao also reviews the history, progression, and prognosis of the Ebola epidemic, the cause of failure in the early prevention and containment of the disease, the role of government policies and public health systems, and global prospects and strategies for similar acute infectious diseases in the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
