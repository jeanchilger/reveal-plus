With the advent of r-DNA technology, it is possible to construct vector with immunologically active genes against specific pathogens. Nevertheless, site-specific delivery of constructed genetic material is an important contributory factor for eliciting specific cellular and humoral immune response. Nanotechnology has demonstrated immense potential for the site-specific delivery of biomolecules. Several polymeric and lipidic nanocarriers have been utilized for the delivery of genetic materials. These systems seem to have better compatibility, low toxicity, economical and capable to delivering biomolecules to intracellular site for the better expression of desired antigens. Further, surface engineering of nanocarriers and targeting approaches have an ability to offer better presentation of antigenic material to immunological cells. This chapter gives an overview of existing and emerging nanotechnological approaches for the delivery of genetic materials.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
