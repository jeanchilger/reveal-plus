<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-05-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Killing two birds with one stone: How do Plant Viruses Break Down Plant Defenses and Manipulate Cellular Processes to Replicate Themselves?</TITLE><BODY>As simple organisms with a parasite nature, viruses have become masters in manipulating and subvert cellular components, including host proteins and organelles, to improve viral replication. Therefore, the understanding of viral strategies to manipulate cell function disrupting plant defenses and enhancing viral infection cycles is fundamental to the production of virus-resistant plant lines. After invading susceptible plants, viruses create conditions that favor local and systemic infections by suppressing multiple layers of innate host defenses while use cellular machinery to own benefit. Viral interference in interlinked essential cellular functions results in phenotypic changes and disease symptoms, which debilitates plants favoring infection establishment. Herein in this review, the novelty it will be the discussion about the strategies used by (+) single strand RNA viruses to affect cellular processes and components to improve viral replication, in parallel to overcome plant defenses, favoring disease establishment by applying in one action using the same viral protein to coordinate viral replication and breaking down plant defense. This focus on plant-virus interaction was never done before, and this knowledge has the potential to help in the development of new strategies to produce resistant plants.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
