Despite the rapid development of vaccines and drugs, one challenge in disease control is the fact that one pathogen sometimes generates many strains with different spreading features. Hence it is of critical importance to investigate multi-strain epidemic dynamics and its associated epidemic control strategies. In this paper, we investigate two controlled multi-strain epidemic models for heterogeneous populations over a large complex network and obtain the structure of optimal control policies for both models. Numerical examples are used to corroborate the analytical results.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
