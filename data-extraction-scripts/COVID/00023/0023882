Although demyelination is the primary pathological process detected in the central nervous system of infected mice, axonal dysfunction and damage also occur concomitantly with demyelination. This process is T cell mediated, with either CD4 or CDS T cells sufficient for MHV-induced axonal damage. A striking feature is that axonal damage occurs early in the disease process, at nearly the same time as demyelination is first observed. Axonal damage in MHV-infected mice has many similarities with the parallel process in humans with multiple sclerosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
