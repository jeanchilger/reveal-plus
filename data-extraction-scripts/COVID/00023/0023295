<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-06-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Respiratory viral infections post-lung transplantation</TITLE><BODY>Community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) are common pathogens in lung transplant recipients. Infection due to these viruses is associated with multiple complications including: rhinitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, respiratory failure and even death. CARVs have also become increasingly recognized as a risk factor for acute rejection (AR) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Newer diagnostic techniques have enhanced the accuracy of diagnosis, but proven treatment options for CARVs are limited. Further insight into the immune response and allograft dysfunction associated with CARV infections is needed in order to develop novel management strategies which can reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by these infectious agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
