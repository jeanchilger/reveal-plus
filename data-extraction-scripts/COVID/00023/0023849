<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-05-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Edible Rabies Vaccines</TITLE><BODY>Rabies has been one of the most feared diseases throughout history. Human rabies remains an important public health problem in many developing countries. The WHO reports that more than 55,000 people die of this disease every year. Most of these cases occur in developing countries. In most Latin American countries, the major reservoirs of rabies are the dog and the hematophagous bat (Desmodus rotundus), which is present in the tropical and subtropical areas from Northern Mexico to Northern Argentina and Chile and transmits the disease to cattle. One of the better options for controlling rabies is vaccination. The expression of rabies virus G protein in different plant systems for developing an oral rabies vaccine could reduce costs of production and distribution and would be convenient for developing countries where the disease is endemic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
