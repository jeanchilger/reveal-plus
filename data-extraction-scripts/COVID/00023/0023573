<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Antibacterial Activity of Chitosan-Based Systems</TITLE><BODY>Chitosan and its derivatives can be called environmental purification functional materials as they can effectively control the growth and reproduction of hazardous bacteria and also control toxic pollutants. From the basic science to the latest developments and innovations, starting with the history of the material, this chapter presents a facile way to understand the antibacterial activity of the chitosan, together with other materials, to the reader. This chapter also summarizes the general developments in the study of antimicrobial applications. In the light of the current situation of the research and the progress in the related fields, this chapter discusses the differences among influencing factors in detail and compares the antimicrobial activity between different physical states of chitosan. Also, this chaper discusses the more recent processes and applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
