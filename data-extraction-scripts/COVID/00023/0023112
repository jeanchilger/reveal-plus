<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-05-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Biological effects of HBV X protein on hepatocellular carcinogenesis in association with cellular factors</TITLE><BODY>The X protein (HBx) of Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) acts as an indirect transcriptional transactivator to regulate the expression of many viral and cellular genes, as well as playing a critical role in pathogenesis and the development of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we described the biological effects of HBx in association with four cellular factors, including inflammatory factors (COX-2 and iNOS), oncoprotein (Ras), and a newly identified tumor suppressor (YueF). The characteristics of these effectors, which might be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, are also discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
