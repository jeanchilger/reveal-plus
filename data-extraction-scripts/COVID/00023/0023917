In particular, studies on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have profited from this technology in the past. In this review, we summarize the existing animal models for the protective axis of the RAS consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin-(1-7)(Ang-(1-7), and its receptor Mas. With the help of models with altered expression of the components of this axis in the brain and cardiovascular organs, its physiological and pathophysiological functions have been elucidated. Thus, novel opportunities for therapeutic interventions in cardiovascular diseases were revealed targeting ACE2 or Mas.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
