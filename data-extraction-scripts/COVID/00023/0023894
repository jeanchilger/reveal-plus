<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-02-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Venous Thrombus</TITLE><BODY>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Both belonging to thrombus, acute arterial thrombus is white thrombus, while acute venous thrombus is red thrombus. What does the pathological difference mean? Venous thrombosis can autolyze, while arterial thrombosis cannot. For VTE patients, oral anticoagulants are usually recommended for 3, 6, or 12 months and occasionally lifelong, but the course cannot be determined. Furthermore, even with standard anticoagulation therapy and INR, some patients still develop chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Thus, the physicians are extremely puzzled about anticoagulant usage. Proposed risk factors for VTE include advanced age, infection, malignancy, autoimmune disease, surgery, trauma, pregnancy, long trip syndrome, family history, AMI, heart failure, and so on. Relevant risk factors are increasing over time. Risk factors are derived from the summary of evidence-based medicine. Although these factors are found to be associated with venous thrombosis, the intrinsic factors have not been well elucidated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
