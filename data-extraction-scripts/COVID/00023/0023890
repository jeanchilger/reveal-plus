<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-05-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Lung</TITLE><BODY>In the present chapter, we review and summarize current advances on the role of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] in the pathophysiology of main lung diseases: pulmonary hypertension (PH), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma, and pulmonary fibrosis. Understanding the involvement of renin angiotensin system (RAS) in pulmonary inflammation may open new therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of respiratory diseases. Studies to date showed that Ang-(1-7) presents anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic activities and reduces pulmonary remodeling. These actions support the development of new pharmacological therapies based on the increase in Ang-(1-7) in the lungs to improve the treatment of inflammatory diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
