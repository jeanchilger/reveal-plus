The continuous detection and remote monitoring of infected patients are required in order to prevent the spread of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Healthcare services based on Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies are emerging as a more effective and proactive solution which provides remote continuous monitoring of patients. A novel architecture based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID), wearable sensor technology, and cloud computing infrastructure is proposed for the detection and monitoring of Ebola infected patients. The aim of this work is to prevent the spreading of the infection at the early stage of the outbreak. The J48 decision tree is used to evaluate the level of infection in a user depending on his symptoms. RFID is used to automatically sense the close proximity interactions (CPIs) between users. Temporal Network Analysis (TNA) is applied to describe and monitor the current state of the outbreak using the CPI data. The performance and accuracy of our proposed model are evaluated on Amazon EC2 cloud using synthetic data of two million users. Our proposed model provided 94 % accuracy for the classification and 92 % of the resource utilization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
