We also analyzed the effect of the siRNA on proliferation of HT-29 cells by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and expression level of VEGF mRNA of transfected cells by RT-PCR as well as amounts of secreted VEGF protein in the supernatant by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Two groups of siRNA targeting human VEGF effectively inhibited proliferation of HT-29 cells after transfection. The secretion of VEGF protein also notably decreased, but the control scramble siRNA showed no effect.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
