An important step in ensuring safety is the screening of donated blood for infectious diseases. Molecular technologies for screening infectious diseases have improved remarkably over the years. Molecular biological assay significantly reduced the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. Unlike previous methods, molecular technologies for screening infectious diseases are specific, efficient, easy to use, and economical. A new era in molecular biology is coming to the field of blood safety.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
