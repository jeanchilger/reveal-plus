<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-09-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Real-Time RT-PCR Detection of Equine Coronavirus</TITLE><BODY>Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is a recently identified equine virus, involved mainly in enteric infections. Since the ECoV discovery in 1999, only two real-time RT-PCRs have been developed for viral identification. In this chapter we describe a one-step real-time RT-PCR that has been routinely used in our laboratory for ECoV detection from fecal and respiratory samples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
