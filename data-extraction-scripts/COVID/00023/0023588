<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-12-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Incidental Findings in TMJ Imaging</TITLE><BODY>For years, the conventional imaging modalities are generally used in dental practice routine. They provide precious information about dentomaxillofacial region; they also have some limitations such as superimpositions, magnifications, distortions, and low-image quality. Because of these limitations, some pathologies, calcifications, and anatomical variations may be missed. Any findings on a radiographic image which are not related to the research areas of interest could be a description of “incidental findings.” Calcifications are one of these incidental findings. They are asymptomatic and also common in TMJ images. Although most of the calcifications require no treatment, correct identification will reduce further diagnostic assessments. Incidental findings on TMJ images were rare, while examining images for temporomandibular disorders and associated issues, it is important not only to examine the TMJ structures but also to look at the nearby anatomical features to check for evidence of incidental findings pathologies that may have mimicked signs and symptoms of TMJ disorders.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
