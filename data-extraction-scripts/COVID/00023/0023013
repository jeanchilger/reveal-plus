The viral infected cells exhibit a complicated cross-talking between autophagy and virus. It has been shown that autophagy interacts with both adaptive and innate immunity. For adaptive immunity, viral antigens can be processed in autophagosomes by acidic proteases before major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation. For innate immunity, autophagy may assist in the delivery of viral nucleic acids to endosomal TLRs and also functions as a part of the TLR-or-PKR-downstream responses. Autophagy was also reported to suppress the magnitude of host innate antiviral immunity in certain cases. On the other hand, viruses has evolved many strategies to combat or utilize the host autophagy for their own benefit. In this review we discussed recent advances toward clarifying the cross-talking between autophagy and viral infection in mammalian cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
