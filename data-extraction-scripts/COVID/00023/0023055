MS liquid medium supplemented with 0.01 mg l(−1) of NAA was most effective for stolon proliferation. Extensive proliferation of stolon and shoot regeneration was achieved on medium containing 3 % sucrose with 0.01 mg l(−1) NAA. Stolons with nodes showing growth was transferred under light for plantlet regeneration in the same medium. This paper is the first report in G. glabra describing a complete regeneration procedure via in vitro stolon proliferation along with quantitative data for glycyrrhizin and genetic fidelity of plant regenerated in vitro there from. In vitro stolon proliferation described here would be an efficient way for regeneration of plants for functional genomics studies and better understanding of glycyrrhizin (GA) metabolism.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
