Humans infected by Chlamydia psittaci may suffer from unapparent subclinical infection, with symptoms ranging from mild flulike illness to severe SARS. As a typical animal-based infectious disease, psittacosis rarely has pulmonary signs but a long illness course, despite its clinical manifestation characterized by severe pulmonary lesions. Repeated onsets of psittacosis may lead to chronic diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
