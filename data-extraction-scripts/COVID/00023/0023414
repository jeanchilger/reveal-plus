The benefit of SDP on Escherichia coli infection is well documented. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of bovine SDP (BovSDP) in the pig diet on acute porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection. A total of 16 3-wk-old conventional crossbred pigs were used and divided into three groups. Treatments included 1) a negative control group fed a commercial diet and sham inoculated with commercial liquid porcine plasma (n = 3), 2) a positive control group fed a commercial diet and inoculated with PEDV-spiked porcine plasma (PEDV; n = 8), and 3) a third group of pigs fed the commercial diet with inclusion of 5% spray-dried bovine plasma and inoculated with PEDV-spiked porcine plasma (BovSDP; n = 5). Although clinical signs associated with PEDV infection were mild in the BovSDP group, two of eight pigs in the PEDV group developed moderate clinical disease and had to be euthanized. The PEDV IgG and IgA antibody levels and prevalence rates were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the PEDV–BovSDP group compared with the PEDV group at 7 d postinoculation. The average fecal PEDV RNA shedding time was 7.2 ± 1.0 d for the PEDV–BovSDP group and 9.3 ± 1.1 d for the PEDV group with an overall time to clearance of PEDV shedding of 11 d for PEDV–BovSDP pigs and at least 14 d for PEDV pigs, which was not different (P = 0.215). The results indicate that addition of BovSDP induced an earlier anti-PEDV antibody response in pigs experimentally infected with PEDV thereby reducing clinical disease and the amount and duration of viral shedding during acute PEDV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
