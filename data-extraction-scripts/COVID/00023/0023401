Although the epidemiology of many respiratory viruses has been well characterized in this population, little is known about the epidemiology of human coronavirus (HoCV) infection. METHODS: We identified HSCT recipients with symptoms of a respiratory tract infection who tested positive for HoCV by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab from January 2013 to December 2016 at our hospital. NP swabs were analyzed by the FilmArray® Respiratory Panel, which detects 17 respiratory viruses, including 4 coronavirus serotypes. We reviewed the demographics, transplant type, comorbidities, smoking status, respiratory symptoms, co-pathogens, and radiographic findings of infected patients. We then assessed the incidence of developing a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), defined as new pulmonary infiltrates or detection of HoCV in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, within 30 days of initial diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 58 HSCT recipients who tested positive for HoCV. The median patient age was 54 years, 29 (50%) were men, and 24 (41%) were current or prior smokers. Fifty (86%) patients had received an allogeneic HSCT and 8 (14%) had received an autologous HSCT. The coronavirus serotypes were: OC43 (n = 19, 33%), NL63 (n = 18, 31%), HKU1 (n = 16, 28%), and 229E (n = 5, 9%). The median time from transplant until detection of HoCV infection was 135 days (IQR=256). Seventeen (29%) patients were lymphopenic at the time of diagnosis and 17 (29%) were receiving corticosteroids. The most common initial symptoms were cough (n = 41, 71%), rhinorrhea (n = 31, 53%), and dyspnea (n = 17, 29%), and 19 (33%) and 16 (28%) patients had fever and hypoxia, respectively. Seventeen patients (29%) developed a LRTI within 30 days of diagnosis and 43% harbored a co-pathogen in the blood or respiratory tract. Three patients (5%) were intubated for respiratory failure and 1 (2%) died within 30 days. CONCLUSION: HoCV infection is common in HSCT recipients and is caused by multiple serotypes. Nearly one-third of patients have fever and hypoxia upon initial diagnosis or progress to LRTI. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for HoCV LRTI in this population.
