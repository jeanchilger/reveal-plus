New advances increase the possibilities and applications of the baculovirus expression system, which makes it possible to express multiple genes simultaneously within a single infected insect cell and to obtain multimeric proteins functionally similar to their natural analogs. Recombinant viruses with expression cassettes active in mammalian cells are used to deliver and express genes in mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. Further improvement of the baculovirus expression system and its adaptation to specific target cells can open up a wide variety of applications. The review considers recent achievements in the use of modified baculoviruses to express recombinant proteins in eukaryotic cells, advantages and drawbacks of the baculovirus expression system, and ways to optimize the expression of recombinant proteins in both insect and mammalian cell lines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
