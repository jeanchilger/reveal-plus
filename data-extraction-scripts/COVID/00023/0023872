<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008</DATELINE><TITLE>A Young Lady with AVN after SARS</TITLE><BODY>Section I consists of a total of 39 clinical cases ranging from the very common case scenarios orthopedic surgeons and generalists see literally every day in their clinics (like issues regarding glucosamine, knee osteo-arthritis, bone health, foot problems associated with the wearing of high heels) to the introduction of new emerging rehabilitation techniques and concepts. Examples include concepts of home-based rehabilitation, the use of smart materials now popular in the field of engineering applied to orthopedics, the response of our skeleton to hyper-gravity stimulation and to micro-gravity environments as in space travel. Orthopedic conditions in which rehabilitation can be very challenging like hamstring injuries will also be touched upon.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
