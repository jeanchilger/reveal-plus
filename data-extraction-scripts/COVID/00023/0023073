In this paper, full-length MHC IIA cDNA was isolated from swamp eel (Monopterus albus) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. The genomic structure, molecular polymorphism, tissue distribution, and immune response of the MHC IIA gene to bacterial challenge were investigated. The full-length cDNA (GenBank accession No.: KC616308) is 1,509 bp in length including an 83 bp-long 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and a 709 bp-long 3′ UTR, which encoded a 238 amino acids protein. In the 2,339 bp-long MHC IIA genomic DNA, four exons and three introns were identified. Sequence comparison exhibited that the deduced amino acid sequence shared 27.1–66.3% identity with those of other species. Seven alleles were identified from five healthy individuals. Number of alleles per individual diversified from two to five. Five different 5′ UTR sequences and two different 3′ UTR sequences from one individual may infer the existence of five loci at least. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that swamp eel MHC IIA transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in ten tissues, but the expression level was distinctly different. Significant changes were observed in liver, spleen, kidney and intestine after challenged with pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas hydrophilia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
