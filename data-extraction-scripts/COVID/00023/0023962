<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-04-17</DATELINE><TITLE>Update in Pediatric Hospital Medicine</TITLE><BODY>Pediatric Hospital Medicine has significantly developed as a field over the past two decades. With the goal of improving care for hospitalized children, much of the research in this field has focused on reducing unnecessary interventions, optimizing necessary treatments, and reducing variability for common inpatient conditions. While this is far from an exhaustive chapter on the vast diversity and advances in this field, it focuses on the updates for some of the top diagnoses in hospital medicine and the major trends in the field. Updated management of acute viral bronchiolitis, urinary tract infections, neonatal infections, brief resolved unexplained events (formerly, apparent life-threatening events), and osteomyelitis are highlighted with emphasis on major management changes. In addition, and distinct to pediatric hospital medicine, the topics of overuse and high value care are discussed as they have gained momentum in influencing the way hospitalists think and practice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
