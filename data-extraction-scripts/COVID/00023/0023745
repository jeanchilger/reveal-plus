<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-12-30</DATELINE><TITLE>The Ligands of C-Type Lectins</TITLE><BODY>In this chapter, a comprehensive overview of the known ligands for the C-type lectins (CTLs) is provided. Emphasis has been placed on the chemical structure of the glycans that bind to the different CTLs and the amount of structural variation (or overlap) that each CTL can tolerate. In this way, both the synthetic carbohydrate chemist and the immunologist can more readily gain insight into the existing structure-activity space for the CTL ligands and, ideally, see areas of synergy that will help identify and refine the ligands for these receptors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
