<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-03-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Lychee Biology and Biotechnology</TITLE><BODY>Lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is one of the revered members of the soapberry family Sapindaceae which includes 150 genera and 2000 species. It is a tropical and subtropical fruit tree which is native to Fujian and Guangdong regions of China and is cultivated as an important commercial fruit crop in many parts of the world. It is famous for its fragrant and sugary flavour. After China, India is at the second position in the production of lychee in the world. The varieties with large pulp, small seeds and noteworthy flavour are of great interest among the consumers and farmers. Lychee fruit took tremendous attention of scientists as it contains ample amounts of anti-oxidants, vitamins and fibre. Moreover, the plant parts possess considerable anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-tumour and anti-oxidant properties. Propagation of lychee from seeds is difficult and not practicable because of longer juvenile period and non-viable, abortive and genetically diverse nature of the seedlings. However, the techniques such as cell, tissue and organ culture (micropropagation) can overcome the difficulties of lychee propagation. Very limited efforts have been made in its varietal improvement through hybridization and modern breeding techniques. In a nutshell, lychee is an important commercial fruit crop, and there is a need to develop technical research so as to sustain and enhance its yield, postharvest management, medicinal value and marketing. This chapter comprises of botanical description, cultivation, medicinal uses, micropropagation and trading of Litchi chinensis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
