<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-01-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Emerging Viral Infections in India</TITLE><BODY>Despite an elaborate armamentarium to tackle microbes, emerging infectious diseases remain a crucial global challenge. Emerging infections can be defined as “infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed previously but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range.” Several factors like increase in international travel and trade, human encroachment on wild-life habitats, changes in agricultural practices and wild-life trade have contributed to the emergence of pathogens. Emergence/re-emergence of several viral infections has been reported from India in the past few decades; some of the important emerging viral infections are discussed in this review. They include infection due to Nipah, Hantaviruses, Chikungunya, Human Enterovirus-71, Influenza, Chandipura, Crimean Congo, SARS Coronavirus, Buffalopox, Dengue and Japanese Encephalitis viruses. Creating increased awareness and training of clinical microbiologists/virologists for identification of new/emerging pathogens, and prompt reporting and management of outbreaks is essential to tackle the threat posed by emerging/re-emerging infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
