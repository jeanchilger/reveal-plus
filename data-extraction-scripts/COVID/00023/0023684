Easily transmitted between people, respiratory pathogens are a leading cause of widespread illness but can be prevented. With the use of standard precautions, appropriate respiratory and hand hygiene, and appropriate patient precautions at the onset of symptoms, respiratory infections can be managed and maintained. There are several key pathogens that contribute to the burden of respiratory disease across the globe, among them are Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Haemophilus influenzae. Some respiratory infections are self-limiting and require symptomatic treatment, while some require specific treatments and antibiotics. This chapter will review protocols to limit the spread of respiratory infections, respiratory hygiene methods, as well as common and virulent respiratory infections and methods of management and treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
