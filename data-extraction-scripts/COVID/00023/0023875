<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-02-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Bronchiolitis</TITLE><BODY>Bronchiolitis produces significant morbidity and mortality worldwide every year. Approximately 3–10 % of all infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis develop acute respiratory failure and require admission to a pediatric intensive care unit. The vast majority of cases are caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), though other viruses (human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and bocavirus) may also cause bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is not merely a single organ disease (i.e. lung), but impacts on extrapulmonary organ systems. Basic supportive management remains the cornerstone. There is a paucity of established therapeutic options, with supplementary oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), humidified high-flow nasal oxygen, mechanical ventilation being the mainstay of respiratory support.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
