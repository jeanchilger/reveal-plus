Transgenic whole plants and plant cell culture systems have been developed that have the capacity to economically produce large-scale quantities of antibodies and antibody fragments, antigens and/or vaccine epitopes, metabolic enzymes, hormones, (neuro)peptides and a variety of biologically active complexes and secondary metabolites for direct use as therapeutic agents or diagnostic tools in the medical healthcare industry. As the products of genetically modified plants make their way from concept to commercialization the associated risks and acceptance by the public has been become a focal point. In this paper, we summarize the recent advances made in the use of transgenic plants and plant cell cultures as biological factories for the production of human therapeutics and biopharmaceuticals and discuss the long-term potential of `molecular farming' as a low-cost, efficient method for the production of biological materials with demonstrated utility to the pharmaceutical industry or medical community.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
