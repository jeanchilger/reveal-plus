<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-08-22</DATELINE><TITLE>A Review of Hendra Virus and Nipah Virus Infections in Man and Other Animals</TITLE><BODY>Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) emerged in the last decade of the twentieth century. They were the cause of a number of outbreaks of respiratory and neurological disease infecting horses and pigs respectively. Transmission from infected domestic animal species resulted in human infections as well, with high case fatality rates a feature. Today they continue to cause outbreaks of human and animal disease. NiV causes yearly disease outbreaks in humans in Bangladesh, and HeV causes sporadic disease outbreaks in horses in north eastern Australia. Due to their zoonotic nature, they have been ideal candidates for collaborative projects in the One Health space, bringing public health and animal health professionals together. This has lead to insightful epidemiological studies, which has resulted in practical disease prevention solutions including a horse vaccine for HeV and NiV spill-over prevention interventions in the field. As more surveillance is undertaken, their known distributions have expanded, as has the range of reservoir host species. The majority of bat species for which there is evidence of henipavirus infection belong to the group known as the Old World family of fruit and nectar feeding bats (Family Pteropodidae, Suborder Megachiroptera). This review of the bat borne henipaviruses discusses the epidemiology, pathology, transmission and disease symptoms in these closely related viruses which belong to the Genus Henipavirus, Family Paramyxoviridae.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
