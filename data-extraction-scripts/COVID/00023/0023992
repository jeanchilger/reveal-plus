<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-07-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Bioinformatics and Translation Elongation</TITLE><BODY>Codon usage depends on mutation bias, tRNA-mediated selection, and the need for high efficiency and accuracy in translation. One codon in a synonymous codon family is often strongly over-used, especially in highly expressed genes, which often leads to a high dN/dS ratio because dS is very small. Many different codon usage indices have been proposed to measure codon usage and codon adaptation. Sense codon could be misread by release factors and stop codons misread by tRNAs, which also contribute to codon usage in rare cases. This chapter outlines the conceptual framework on codon evolution, illustrates codon-specific and gene-specific codon usage indices, and presents their applications. A new index for codon adaptation that accounts for background mutation bias (Index of Translation Elongation) is presented and contrasted with codon adaptation index (CAI) which does not consider background mutation bias. They are used to re-analyze data from a recent paper claiming that translation elongation efficiency matters little in protein production. The reanalysis disproves the claim.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
