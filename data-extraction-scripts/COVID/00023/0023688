<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-07-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Field Epidemiology and One Health: Thailand’s Experience</TITLE><BODY>Field epidemiology has become a major principle in public health and animal health service. Field epidemiologists are the primary group of professionals responding to outbreaks and other health emergencies who provide evidence-based recommendations for decision makers. In outbreak investigations, their duties are to identify the disease etiology, risk factors or source of an outbreak, and to contain the spread of the disease. Field epidemiology training programs (FETP) recruit professionals with training in medical, veterinary medical and other related health sciences to deal with real-life outbreaks and health problems. Joint training in surveillance and outbreak investigation has led to improved surveillance and control of zoonotic diseases by young professionals from human health and animal health sectors. Field epidemiology training programs for veterinarians (FETPV) is a living branch of a mature FETP which could support the development of wildlife and ecosystem needs under a broad One Health canopy. FETP can be a practical means of actualizing the One Health approach based upon shared needs and mutual benefit. One such model for sustainable, joint capacity development in field epidemiology under a One Health approach has been initiated in Thailand and is being adopted in other Asian countries. The Field Epidemiology Training Network of FETP in Southeast Asia is a useful platform for further strengthening regional disease surveillance and improving response to both public and animal health problems of international concern.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
