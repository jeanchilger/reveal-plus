Chlorogenic acid (CGA) has important biological and pharmacological activities. It is significant to develop a green and efficient method to extract GCA from Flos Lonicera japonica (FLJ) by integrating the advantages of the ionic liquids and enzymes. RESULTS: The optimal type of enzyme and ionic liquid was screened. Pectinase in [C6mim] Br aqueous phase was demonstrated to be an ideal combination. The parameters including extraction time, extraction temperature, pH, enzyme amount, and IL concentration were optimized systematically. Scanning electronic microscopy of FLJ samples demonstrated that pectinase and ionic liquid disposal both obviously facilitated the extraction process by destroying the structure of cell wall. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that ionic liquid enhanced the activity of the pectinase by altering its secondary structure. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous reported methods, ionic liquid-based enzyme-assisted extraction of GCA from FLJ was proved to be efficient and practical, offering a higher yield in a shorter time. A novel process was proposed for the extraction of active component from natural resources. [Image: see text]&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
