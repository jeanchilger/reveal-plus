Even though influenza affects people of all different ages, it can be extremely hazardous to people of 65 years of age or older since that is the population that makes up the high majority of the death toll caused by influenza-related diseases. Elderly individuals suffer the effects of immunosenescence as they age, which is the diminishing of the overall immune response. Immunosenescence occurs by specifically affecting the adaptive immune response which controls the establishment of immunity after vaccination or infection. There are many studies under way that are trying to find a resolution to the problem of the influenza vaccine not providing enough protection in the elderly population. One of the possible strategies is to seek the use of an optimal adjuvant, an immunological agent that can enhance immune responses, with the current vaccine formulation. Here, we used the murine model to review the effects of adjuvants on the antibody response to influenza vaccines in aged mice. Since adjuvants can enhance the production of important inflammatory cytokines and activation of dendritic cells, the stimulation of these cells are boosted to increase the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in aged mice which would hopefully translate to the elderly.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
