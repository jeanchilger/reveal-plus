<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003</DATELINE><TITLE>Stochastic dynamic model of SARS spreading</TITLE><BODY>Based upon the simulation of the stochastic process of infection, onset and spreading of each SARS patient, a system dynamic model of SRAS spreading is constructed. Data from Vietnam is taken as an example for Monte Carlo test. The preliminary results indicate that the time-dependent infection rate is the most inportant control factor for SARS spreading. The model can be applied to prediction of the course with fluctuations of the epidemics, if the previous history of the epidemics and the future infection rate under control measures are known.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
