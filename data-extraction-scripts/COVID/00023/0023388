This study was conducted to evaluate the genetic analysis of this virus in human and camel at the first time in Iraq. Two hundred samples were collected from camels and human who suffering from respiratory symptoms, these samples treated with RNA extraction kit then amplification the genetic material by PCR which give 5% positive results. The amplicon then sequenced, registration in gene bank of NCBI for getting accession numbers. The local strains give close relationship with neighbor countries as Saudi Arabia and Jordan strains when using MEGA analysis software.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
