<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-06-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus</TITLE><BODY>Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belonging to Coronaviridae family. The disease is prevalent in all countries with almost 100% incidence rate. Chicken and commercially reared pheasant are the natural host for IBV. Virus causes respiratory diseases, poor weight gain, feed efficiency in broiler, damage to oviduct, and abnormal egg production in mature hens resulting in economic losses. IBV also replicates in tracheal and renal epithelial cells leading to prominent tracheal and kidney lesions. Virus undergoes spontaneous mutation leading to continual emergence of new variants. The effectiveness of immunization program is diminished because of poor cross-protection among the serotypes. Identification of circulating serotypes is important in controlling IBV infection. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR21 are involved in early recognition of virus resulting in induction of inflammatory cytokines. Both humoral and cellular immune responses are important in the control of infection. Humoral immunity plays an important role in recovery and clearance of viral infection. IBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes induce lysis of IBV-infected cells. Effective diagnostic tools are required at field level to identify different IBV variants. Embryonated chicken eggs are effective model for virus isolation. Identification by other specific methods like virus neutralization (VN), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, or nucleic acid analysis or by electron microscopy is also indispensable. VN test in tracheal organ culture is the best method for antigenic typing for surveillance purposes. Continuous epidemiological surveillance, strict biosecurity measures, and vaccine effective against various serotypes are necessary for controlling IB in chickens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
