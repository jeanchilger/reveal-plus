The modern medicine and public health have been challenged by a series of emerging and reemerging infections in the past three decades. These diseases have occurred following a false sense of victory over infectious diseases on a global scale due to effective vaccinations and antibiotic agents against certain microorganisms. Because of the unique circumstances of the modern world, these new infectious diseases are emerging at much faster rates than before, and old ones are returning with formidable strength. These infections have posed severe threats to global public health and have raised serious questions regarding the capability of modern medicine to face their challenges. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the dynamics and impact of these emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Diagnostic pathology continues to be an essential counterpart of clinical microbiology in dealing with emerging and reemerging infections. Diagnosis with advanced pathology techniques not only helps identify or confirm the novel pathogens causing emerging infections but is also essential for epidemiologic surveillance and studying pathogenesis of these emerging infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
