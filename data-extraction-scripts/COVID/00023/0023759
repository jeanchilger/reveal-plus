<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-02-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Pulmonary Infections: Imaging with CT</TITLE><BODY>Computed tomography (CT) plays a key role in various kinds of pulmonary infections especially in immunocompromised patients, owing to its much higher sensitivity and specificity than the traditionally performed chest X-ray. CT permits the detection of the main infectious pattern and associated findings with high confidence and allows for the precise assessment of all involved structures, to potentially guide a bronchoalveolar lavage or another diagnostic procedure, and to ensure a reliable follow-up. It may be performed at a carefully chosen dose, which may nearly reach that of a chest X-ray in specific situations. The importance of post-processing tools is undeniable in some conditions, in particular for the evaluation of micronodules in the immunocompromised population. The wide spectrum of features of specific organisms according to the immune status, such as in aspergillosis or tuberculosis, must be known, as well as the potential of atypical presentations in case of Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) pneumonia when occurring in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. In all cases, underlying disorders must be considered as well as all the differential diagnoses. Overall, CT definitely helps clinicians to diagnose pulmonary infections and to make treatment decisions, especially in vulnerable patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
