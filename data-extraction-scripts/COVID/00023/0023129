Understanding airflow dynamics and transport property within an aircraft cabin is critical to creating a healthy cabin environment and improving control of epidemics. This work reveals the temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region and evaluates impact of airflow’s large-scale flow structures (swing motion around the aisle region and large-scale vortices) on transport property by calculating traces of marked fluid particles (MFPs) passing through passengers’ exhalation area within a Boeing 737-200 cabin mock-up. The Peixoto theorem has been used to interpret temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region. Transport property within this single-aisle aircraft cabin is a mixed effect of the airflow’s swing motion, large-scale vortices and longitudinal airflow. Airflow’s swing motion around the aisle region tends to carry MFPs nearby across the aisle region and invade the large-scale vortex in the opposite side. The large-scale vortices try to control MFPs in its each separated zone. The airflow’s swing motion and large-scale vortices dominate MFPs’ latitudinal transmission, while longitudinal airflow dominates MFPs’ longitudinal transmission.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
