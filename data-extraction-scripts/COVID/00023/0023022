The chemical structures of all compounds were fully characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic techniques. The results of the bioassays indicated that compounds Id, Ie, If and IIf proved inhibitory against influenza virus A (EC(50) = 13 – 27 μg/mL for strain H1N1 and 9.3 – 18 μg/mL for strain H3N2). Compounds Ig and IIg were the most cytostatic compounds with inhibition of HeLa cell proliferation at an IC(50) = 0.3 μg/mL for Ig and 1.9 μg/mL for IIg. Especially, compound Ig showed the highest cytostatic activity with IC(50) of 0.30, 0.70 and 2.50 μg/mL against HeLa, CEM and L1210 cell lines, respectively. This inhibition range was within the same order of magnitude as that for cisplatin. Furthermore, molecular modeling was carried out to examine the cytostatic activity and determine the best pharmacophore model as a guide for the design and development of potential prodrugs in future studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
