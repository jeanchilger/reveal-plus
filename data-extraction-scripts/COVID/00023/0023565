Moreover, most human infectious diseases are derived from animals, and zoonotic infections always spread on directed interconnected networks. So, in this article, we consider the epidemic dynamics of zoonotic infections on a unidirectional circular-coupled network. Here, we construct two unidirectional three-layer circular interactive networks, one model has direct contact between interactive networks, the other model describes diseases transmitted through vectors between interactive networks, which are established by introducing the heterogeneous mean-field approach method. Then we obtain the basic reproduction numbers and stability of equilibria of the two models. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, it is found that basic reproduction numbers of the models depend on the infection rates, infection periods, average degrees, and degree ratios. Numerical simulations illustrate and expand these theoretical results very well.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
