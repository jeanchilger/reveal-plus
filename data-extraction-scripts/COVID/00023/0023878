<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>Molecular farming for antigen (vaccine) production in plants</TITLE><BODY>Genomic and proteomic approaches to the study of fundamental cell mechanisms are rapidly contributing to broaden our knowledge on metabolic pathways for the optimal exploitation of the cell as a factory. In the last few years this knowledge has led to important advances in the large scale production of diagnostic and therapeutic proteins in heterologous hosts (bacteria, yeasts, mammalian and insect cells or transgenic animals and plants), allowing the comparison of the most efficient methods in terms of costs, product quality and safety.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
