As a result, it is more realistic to study the spatial pattern of epidemic models with space and time. In this paper, spatial dynamics of an epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate is investigated. We find that there are different types of stationary patterns by amplitude equations and numerical simulations. The obtained results may well explain the distribution of disease observed in the real world and provide some insights on disease control.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
