<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-07-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Human-Wildlife Contact and Emerging Infectious Diseases</TITLE><BODY>The majority of all emerging pathogens in humans are zoonotic (nonhuman animal) in origin. Population, ecological, and behavioral changes that increase contact with wildlife exacerbate emergence of these pathogens. Anthropogenic modification of the physical environment has altered not only our risk of zoonotic infection from wildlife but also the likelihood of pathogen transmission from human to nonhuman animal populations. This is particularly the case for primates that share a number of common infections with humans. In this chapter, I use a series of case studies involving SARS, HIV, Nipah virus, Lyme disease, malaria, and Ebola to exemplify how various anthropogenic factors have facilitated pathogen transmission between human and nonhuman animal populations. The costs and benefits of primate-based ecotourism are also reviewed to better illustrate how human-wildlife contact can affect both populations. Responsible health monitoring of human-wildlife interactions is a necessary prerequisite for prevention of the transmission of future emerging infectious diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
