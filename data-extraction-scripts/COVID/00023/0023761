<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-01-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Malaria</TITLE><BODY>Malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, and environmental changes are likely to increase its importance in the coming years. Diagnosing this disease is difficult and requires a high index of suspicion, especially in non-endemic countries. Critical care providers play a major role in treating severe malaria and its complications, which has management particularities that might not be readily apparent. Fluid resuscitation should be carefully tailored to avoid complications, and dysperfusion seems more related to degree of parasitemia than hypovolemia. Antimalarial agents are effective, but resistance is growing. Complications can be found in nearly every organ, including cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute kidney injury. As such, a critical care unit is frequently required for organ support when they appear. Superimposed infections are not infrequent. Despite all of this, mortality is encouragingly low with a timely diagnosis and access to appropriate treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
