Clinical virology laboratories and laboratorians play an important role in not only the diagnosis but also the surveillance of these pathogens. Surveillance for influenza and other respiratory pathogens is important, as it informs public health decision making in terms of influenza vaccine and antiviral effectiveness, informs clinicians and public health practitioners about the pathogenicity of specific viral strains, guides clinical practice, and supports laboratory panning activities. Key background issues include the following: the fact that the laboratory is only one of several data providers to a surveillance system, the biologic nature of influenza and respiratory viruses and the laboratory needs to keep up to date on the diagnosis of these agents, the need for laboratorians to be involved in case definition development, the impact of push and pull data flow models on laboratory resources, and the fact that laboratories may be asked to provide more than just test results to surveillance programs. This review also identifies some key issues or questions that arise during the pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytic phases that could impact on the ability of the laboratory to link to surveillance programs. Finally, issues surrounding virus characterization programs and how they link to surveillance programs are identified and discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
