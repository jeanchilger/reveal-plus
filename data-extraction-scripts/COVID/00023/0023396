Where ventilation systems facilitate disease transmission to humans or animals, there exists a need for control measures that provide effective protection while imposing minimal pressure differential. In the present study, viral aerosols in an airstream were subjected to non-thermal plasma (NTP) exposure within a packed-bed dielectric barrier discharge reactor. Comparisons of plaque assays before and after NTP treatment found exponentially increasing inactivation of aerosolized MS2 phage with increasing applied voltage. At 30 kV and an air flow rate of 170 standard liters per minute, a greater than 2.3 log reduction of infective virus was achieved across the reactor. This reduction represented ~2 log of the MS2 inactivated and ~0.35 log physically removed in the packed bed. Increasing the air flow rate from 170 to 330 liters per minute did not significantly impact virus inactivation effectiveness. Activated carbon-based ozone filters greatly reduced residual ozone, in some cases down to background levels, while adding less than 20 Pa pressure differential to the 45 Pa differential pressure across the packed bed at the flow rate of 170 standard liters per minute.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
