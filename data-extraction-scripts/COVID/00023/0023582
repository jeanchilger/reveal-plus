<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-01-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Nanomaterials-Based (Bio)Sensing Systems for Safety and Security Applications</TITLE><BODY>The development of new nanomaterials and nanotechnologies has ­provided many new opportunities for (bio)sensing systems. The introduction of nanomaterials, such as magnetic nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, graphene, quantum dots, etc. is bringing advantages in terms of improving the selectivity and sensitivity of these systems. These nanomaterials also offer advantages in biosensors owing to their nanometric size, shape, composition, physical properties, ability to manipulate their surface chemistry and the property that they have in terms of adsorbing biological molecules and the change of their physical properties. In recent years, several ­bacterial pathogens, toxins, viruses, parasites and explosives have been considered as potential threats for bioterrorism, among which can find Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium botulinum, Botulinum Neurotoxin, Vaccinia, Plasmodium falciparum, Trinitrotoluene, etc. Bioterrorism is extremely complex to tackle but the science and technology are fundamental ­elements to reduce its threat. For this reason, monitoring systems for quick identification of biomolecules are the core of much of the basic research activities in combating bioterrorism. In this chapter we discuss the research efforts by using nanobiotechnologies with the aim of developing accurate, easy, cheap, portable and ultrasensitive assays for agents that pose a biologic threat. Some ­nanomaterial-based (bio)sensing systems used to detect agents related with bioterrorism for safety and security applications in agriculture, food, forensic, biomedical are also given.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
