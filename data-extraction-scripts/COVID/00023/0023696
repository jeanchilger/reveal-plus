Serological tests to determine TCoV-specific antibodies are critical to evaluate previous exposure to TCoV in the turkey flocks and differentiate serotypes from different isolates or strains. A specific virus neutralization assay using embryonated turkey eggs and immunofluorescent antibody assay for determining TCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies is described in this chapter. Virus neutralization titer of turkey serum from turkeys infected with TCoV is the dilution of serum that can inhibit TCoV infection in 50 % of embryonated turkey eggs. Virus neutralization assay for TCoV is useful to monitor the immune status of turkey flocks infected with TCoV for the control of the disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
