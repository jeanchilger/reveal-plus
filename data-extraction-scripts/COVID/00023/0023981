<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-05-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Quantitative Performance Monitoring of China’s HIV Response</TITLE><BODY>China has made tremendous progress in advancing its national HIV program. Key to this progress was setting targets to motivate implementers to work effectively. Indicators were established using an iterative process with national stakeholders while also meeting international pressures. A plethora of demands may have distracted from ownership of the initial national program but, in the end, strengthened a focus on marginalized groups. China gradually relied less on donors and developed a uniquely Chinese HIV control program. The result was remarkable enlargement of prevention and treatment services that led to a reduction in mortality. Setting targets, and measuring performance against those targets, was vital to gauge continued progress and identify gaps in programing and implementation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
