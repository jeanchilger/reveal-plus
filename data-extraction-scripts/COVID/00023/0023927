<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-10-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Informatics for Infectious Disease Research and Control</TITLE><BODY>The goal of infectious disease informatics is to optimize the clinical and public health management of infectious diseases through improvements in the development and use of antimicrobials, the design of more effective vaccines, the identification of biomarkers for life-threatening infections, a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions, and biosurveillance and clinical decision support. Infectious disease informatics can lead to more targeted and effective approaches for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infections through a comprehensive review of the genetic repertoire and metabolic profiles of a pathogen. The developments in informatics have been critical in boosting the translational science and in supporting both reductionist and integrative research paradigms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
