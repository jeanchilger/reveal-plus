<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-12-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Pathogen Genomics and the Potential for Understanding Diseases in the Developing World</TITLE><BODY>Approximately 46% and 32% of deaths among children under five globally occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, respectively. Over 80% of the 4.2 million child deaths in Africa are caused by infectious diseases, sharply contrasted to Europe where 39% of the 0.15 million child deaths are attributable to infectious diseases (Fig. 5.1) (Black et al. 2010). Hence, despite the remarkable public health advancements in hygiene, sanitation, antimicrobial drugs and vaccine strategies of the twenty-first century, the burden of infectious diseases remains unacceptably high in the developing world.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
