<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-10-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Non-vaccine-Preventable Infections</TITLE><BODY>There are many potentially serious infections that may pose a risk to travellers for which no vaccines are available. Following discussions on vaccines, malaria prevention and travellers’ diarrhoea at the consultation, the travel-medicine practitioner should identify other infectious risks that may apply to the traveller, whether because of destination/s and duration of travel, occupational or other activities, or individual susceptibility. Information should be provided about these infections, their relevance, modes of transmission and methods of prevention, or the traveller should be referred to an authoritative source of information. In this chapter, advice will be given on both destination- and activity-related infections. The risk, distribution, clinical features and methods of prevention of a number of specific infections for which no vaccines are available are then outlined. This includes information on emerging viral infections such as Zika, MERS, Ebola and Chikungunya.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
