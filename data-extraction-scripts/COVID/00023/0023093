<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-12-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Control of Viral Contamination of Food and Environment</TITLE><BODY>Viruses are often transmitted via food and the environment. Contamination may be controlled either by preventing its occurrence or by inactivating the contaminating virus. The majority of agents transmitted in this way are human enteric viruses, produced either in the intestines or the liver. They are shed in human feces (noroviruses also in vomitus) in a broad range of circumstances, and they are relatively stable outside the host. Non-enteric viruses are less often transmitted via foods and are generally less environmentally stable. Insofar as vaccines are available, they are able to prevent fecal shedding. Viruses shed in feces via the water-carriage toilet may be eliminated by proper treatment and disinfection of the wastewater. In the foods context, the most effective antiviral measures are cooking and hand washing. Detection methods are most useful after the fact, in investigating outbreaks and devising preventive measures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
