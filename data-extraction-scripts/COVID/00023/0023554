In addition, we shall examine some of the emerging technologies which are causing remarkable breakthroughs and improvements which were inconceivable earlier. In particular we shall look at the technologies and tools associated with the Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Sensor Networks and Social Media.
