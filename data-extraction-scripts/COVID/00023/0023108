In this study, we explored the feasibility of mRFP1 and its variants for measuring intracellular temperature. A linear relationship was observed between the temperature and fluorescence intensity of mRFP1 and its variants. Temperature sensitivities of E. coli expressing mRFP1, mRFP-P63A and mRFP-P63A[(4R)-FP] were −1.27%, −1.26% and −0.77%/°C, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated the potentiality of mRFP1 and its variants as an in vivo temperature sensor.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
