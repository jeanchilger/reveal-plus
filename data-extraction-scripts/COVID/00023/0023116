By utilizing different extraction solvents, procedures, and times, the optimum extraction conditions were established. The extracts of licorice were separated and determined using a C(18) column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-water (containing 1.0% acetic acid) with a gradient elution of 0∼10 min from 20:80 to 60:40 (v/v). Preparative columns with different packing sizes were investigated to isolate the three compounds from the extracts of licorice. The 12 μm chromatographic column showed better separation for the three compounds from licorice. 0.29 mg/g for liquiritin, 1.43 mg/g for glycyrrhizic acid, and 0.07 mg/g for glabridin were obtained and the recoveries were 80.8, 89.7, and 72.5%, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
