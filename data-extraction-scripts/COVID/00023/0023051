Human coronavirus 229E had been studied well and its receptor-binding domain was restricted to aa417–547 of S protein. However, this region has no homology with the newly separated SARS-associated virus (Hong Kong isolate CUHK-W1). Then we analyzed the phylogenesis of S1 subunit of the coronavirus spike protein (SARS-associated virus, Hong Kong isolate CUHK-W1). Interestingly, the highest homology between murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-associated coronavirus was found. And the important sites (aa62–65 and aa214–216) on the spike protein of MHV with receptor-binding capacity were highly conservative in comparison with the newly separated SARS-associated virus (the corresponding sites are aa51–54 and aal95–197). These results from bioinformatics analysis might help us to study the receptor-binding sites of SARS-associated virus and the mechanism of the virus entry into the target cell, and design antiviral drugs and potent vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
