<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-07-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia</TITLE><BODY>Ventilator-associated pneumonia occurs in patients who have been intubated for at least 2–3 days with significant exposure to hospital-acquired organisms. Treatment should be initiated rapidly and cover Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA). Within 72 h or with the availability of culture results, antibiotics should be narrowed. Active research is on-going to identify patients at risk for ventilator-associated complications and to minimize the likelihood of infection in these patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
