<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-01-04</DATELINE><TITLE>State of research in the field of the creation of plant vaccines for veterinary use</TITLE><BODY>Transgenic plants as an alternative of costly systems of recombinant immunogenic protein expression are the source for the production of cheap and highly efficient biotherapeuticals of new generation, including plant vaccines. In the present review, possibilities of plant system application for the production of recombinant proteins for veterinary use are considered, the history of the “edible vaccine” concept is briefly summarized, advantages and disadvantages of various plant systems for the expression of recombinant immunogenic proteins are discussed. The list of recombinant plant vaccines for veterinary use, which are at different stages of clinical trials, is presented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
