The cell surface of the budding yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was engineered to anchor the K-COE on the outer layer of the cell, and consequently, the altered yeast was applied as a dietary complement for animal feed, with immunogenic functions. In this study, the K-COE gene (K-COE) of the Korean strain of PEDV with the signal peptide of rice amylase 1A (Ramy 1A), was fused with the gene encoding the carboxyterminal half (320 amino acid residues from the C terminus) of yeast α-agglutinin, a mating associated protein that is anchored covalently to the cell wall. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter was selected in order to direct the expression of the fusion construct, and the resulting recombinant plasmid was then introduced intoS. cerevisiae. The surface display of K-COE was visualized via confocal microscopy using a polyclonal antibody against K-COE as the primary antibody, and FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. The display of the K-COE on the cell surface was further verified via Western blot analysis using the cell wall fraction after the administration of α-1,3-glucanase/PNGase F/β-mannosidase treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
