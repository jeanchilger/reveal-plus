Nowadays, its application fields range from medical research to drug discovery, to epidemiology, to systematics and population dynamics. Estimating phylogenies involves solving an optimization problem, called the phylogenetic estimation problem (PEP), whose versions depend on the criterion used to select a phylogeny among plausible alternatives. This chapter offers an overview of PEP and discuss the most important versions that occur in the literature.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
