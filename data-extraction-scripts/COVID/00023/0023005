Used as control, there were in the western medicine (WM) group 29 patients, who were treated with Ribavirin, Levofloxacin, Thymopentin, Azithromycin, methylprednisolone, etc., on the basis of “Recommended Protocol for Infectious Atypical Pneumonia” (abbreviated as “Recommended Protocol”) issueed by Ministry of Health. As the treated group, there were in the ICWM 20 cases. The protocol for treatment of SARS in “Special Science and Technological Action to Prevent and Treat SARS” (abbreviated as “Special S-T Action”), issued by Ministry of Science and Technology, together with the same WM as those for the control group.Results: (1) Time from the disease onset to the symptom improvement were 5.10±2. 83 days and 7. 62±2. 27 days in ICWM and WM group respectively,P < 0.05; (2) As to corticosteroid (CS) amount and days before reducing dosage, 2 groups showed no significant difference,P > 0.05; (3) There was no significant difference in the time from disease onset to the body temperature normalization and the total amount of CS and the duration of using CS before reducing it to 80 mg between the ICWM group and the WM group; (4) The days and amounts for use CS after reducing between the ICWM group and the WM group were significantly different (P < 0. 05).Conclusion: There were obvious advantages in ICWM to treat SARS, compared with that of WM alone, especially in improving the clinical symptoms, promoting the recovery of immune function, promoting the absorption of pulmonary inflammation and reducing the dosage and duration of CS treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
