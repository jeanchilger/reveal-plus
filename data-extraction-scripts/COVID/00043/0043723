The development of airflow dynamics of human exhalation was characterized using nonhazardous schlieren photography technique, providing a visualization and quantification of turbulent exhaled airflow from 18 healthy human subjects whilst standing and lying. The flow shape of each breathing pattern was characterized by two angles and averaged values of 18 subjects. Two exhaled air velocities, u m and u p , were measured and compared. The mean peak centerline velocity, u m was found to decay correspondingly with increasing horizontal distance x in a form of power function. The mean propagation velocity, u p was found to correlate with physiological parameters of human subjects. This was always lower than u m at the mouth/nose opening, due to a vortex like airflow in front of a single exhalation cycle. When examining the talking and breathing process between two persons, the potential infectious risk was found to depend on their breathing patterns and spatial distribution of their exhaled air. Our study when combined with information on generation and distributions of pathogens could provide a prediction method and control strategy to minimize infection risk between persons in indoor environments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
