It is noteworthy that all mechanisms appear to utilize host membranes as a site of replication. Membranes appear to function not only as a way of compartmentalizing virus RNA replication but also appear to have a central role in the organization and functioning of the replication complex, and further studies in this area are needed. Within virus supergroups, similarities are evident between animal and plant viruses—for example, in the nature and arrangements of replication genes and in sequence similarities of functional domains. However, it is also clear that there has been considerable divergence, even within supergroups. For example, the animal alpha-viruses have evolved to encode proteinases which play a central controlling function in the replication cycle, whereas this is not common in the plant alpha-like viruses and even when it occurs, as in the tymoviruses, the strategies that have evolved appear to be significantly different. Some of the divergence could be host-dependent and the increasing interest in the role of host proteins in replication should be fruitful in revealing how different systems have evolved. Finally, there are virus supergroups that appear to have no close relatives between animals and plants, such as the animal coronavirus-like supergroup and the plant carmo-like supergroup.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
