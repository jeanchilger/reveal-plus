For both viruses two regions of their genomic RNAs were found to be duplicated and rearranged. The viral genomes contain a small duplicated element (SD) derived from the genomic 5' end far downstream of its original context. This sequence is followed by a larger duplication which encompasses the region coding for the protein p80(LD), a molecular marker for cpBVDV. The SD element codes for the viral protease p20. In the case of the viruses analyzed here the aminoterminus of p80 is generated by autoproteolytic removal of the preceding SD-encoded protease. For one of the cpBVDV isolates a specific fusion protein (p28) could be identified which is composed of p20 and part of p10, another viral protein. Molecular characterization of the respective noncytopathogenic counterpart revealed that duplication and rearrangement of sequences as well as the expression of p28 and p80 are specific for the cytopathogenic virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
