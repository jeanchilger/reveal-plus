In this study, Isatis indigotica root extract, five major compounds of I. indigotica root, and seven plant-derived phenolic compounds were tested for anti-SARS-CoV 3CLpro effects using cell-free and cell-based cleavage assays. Cleavage assays with the 3CLpro demonstrated that IC50 values were in micromolar ranges for I. indigotica root extract, indigo, sinigrin, aloe emodin and hesperetin. Sinigrin (IC50: 217μM) was more efficient in blocking the cleavage processing of the 3CLpro than indigo (IC50: 752μM) and beta-sitosterol (IC50: 1210μM) in the cell-based assay. Only two phenolic compounds aloe emodin and hesperetin dose-dependently inhibited cleavage activity of the 3CLpro, in which the IC50 was 366μM for aloe emodin and 8.3μM for hesperetin in the cell-based assay.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
