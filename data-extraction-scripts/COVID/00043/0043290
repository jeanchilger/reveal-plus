In this study, we aimed to analyze candidate molecules for targeted therapy of scirrhous gastric cancer. We searched for molecules/metabolic activity that might be predominantly expressed in a subpopulation of scirrhous gastric cancer cells and might function as cancer stem cell markers. RESULTS: For this purpose, we investigated the expression of various cell surface markers and of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. These analyses showed that the scirrhous gastric cancer cell lines HSC-58 and HSC-44PE heterogeneously expressed CD13, while CD44, CDCP1, EpCAM and ABCG2 were expressed uniformly. Moreover, 10% of the total HSC-58 cell population expressed ALDH enzyme activity. A subpopulation of cells strongly positive for ALDH also expressed high levels of CD13, both of which are known as cancer stem cell markers. HSC-58 cells expressing high levels of CD13 showed lower sensitivity to a cancer drug cisplatin than cells with low levels of CD13. In contrast, CD13(-high) subpopulation of HSC-58 was more sensitive to an aminopeptidase N inhibitor bestatin. In terms of antibody-drug therapy, anti-CD13-immunotoxin was highly cytotoxic towards HSC-58 cells and was more cytotoxic than anti-EpCAM-immunotoxin. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CD13 is a suitable cell surface candidate for targeted antibody-drug therapy of scirrhous gastric cancer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
