Localization of resident marker proteins has shown that this compartment consists of both peripheral and central elements. The aim of the present review is to combine the data on the pre-Golgi compartment with previous ideas of membrane traffic at the ER-Golgi interface. We propose a model which describes how mobile, endosome-like elements of the pre-Golgi compartment function in the generation of the compositional and functional boundary between the widely distributed ER and the more centrally located Golgi stacks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
