We characterized in mammalian cells the model of ribosomal stalling at the STOP-codon based on proteins tagged at the C-terminus with the picornavirus 2A peptide followed by a termination codon instead of the Proline (2A*). We exploited the 2A* stalling model to characterize the pathway of degradation of ER-targeted polypeptides. We report that the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 is a new main factor involved. Moreover, degradation of the ER-stalled polypeptides required the activities of the AAA-ATPase VCP/p97, its associated deubiquitinylase YOD1, the ribosome-associated ubiquitin ligase Listerin and the proteasome. In human proteome, we found two human C-terminal amino acid sequences that cause similar stalling at the STOP-codon. Our data suggest that translational stalling at the ER membrane activates protein degradation at the interface of ribosomal- and ER-associated quality control systems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
