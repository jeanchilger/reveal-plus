From the initial applications of DNA microarrays to uncover gene expression patterns that are diagnostic and prognostic of cancer, understanding the interplay between immune responses and disease has been a prime application of this technology. More recent efforts have moved beyond genetic analysis to functional analysis of the molecules involved, including identification of immunodominant antigens and peptides as well as the role of post-translational glycosylation. Here, we focus on recent applications of microarray technology in understanding the detailed chemical biology of immune responses to disease in an effort to guide development of vaccines and other protective therapies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
