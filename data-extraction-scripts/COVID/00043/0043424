In this regard, although there is growing interest in the applications of solid-state NMR to biological systems, this subject lies outside the scope of this work, which will be therefore limited to NMR studies carried out in solution. Starting from some review papers published in the last few years, we are here covering relevant results in the field, including the most recent findings reported in the literature to date.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
