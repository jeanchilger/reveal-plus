In particular, diseases caused by viral pathogens have demonstrated the need for new medicines, due to the increasing appearance of resistance to these available treatments. Thousands of novel compounds have been isolated from various marine organisms and tested for pharmacological properties, many of which are commercially available. The screening of natural products derived from marine species for antiviral activity has yielded a considerable number of active crude aqueous and organic solvent extracts. Today, over 40 compounds are commercially available in pharmacological markets, including alternative antiviral medicines or those being tested as potential antiviral drugs. Many more are being tested as potential antiviral drugs at the preclinical and clinical stages. The growing interest in marine-derived antiviral compounds, along with the development of new technology in marine cultures and extraction, will significantly expedite the current exploration of the marine environment for compounds with significant pharmacological applications, which will continue to be a promising strategy and new trend for modern medicine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
