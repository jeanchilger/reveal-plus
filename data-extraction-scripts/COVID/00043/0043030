To elucidate the role of Giardia duodenalis in calf scours, diagnostic samples from 189 scouring calves were tested by different assays during a 1-year-study period. Giardia antigens were detected in 22/189 scouring calves by a fecal-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 10 of these were positive for assemblage E, G. duodenalis by polymerase chain reaction. Giardia trophozoites were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in intestinal sections from five calves in which the parasites were spatially distributed in areas of microscopically detectable enteritis. Our data suggest that under certain circumstances, Giardia may cause intestinal lesions leading to calf scours. Gnotobiotic calf-based infectivity studies are needed if the pathogenicity of Giardia in calves is to be definitively determined.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
