Technical realisation of blood counts, cytology of normal and abnormal blood cells and significance of the pathologic cell counts are successively treated. Distinctive features of cytology and cell counts in herbivores, horses and cattle, are detailed in a separate chapter. Difficulties of veterinary haematology lie in qualitative and quantitative differences between blood cells of various animal species. Bone marrow cells exploration is not performed in this review.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
