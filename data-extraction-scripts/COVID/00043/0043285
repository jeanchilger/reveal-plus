They are thus looking for support in order to understand the extent of the risk, and guidance on how to deal with situations where preventing infection from these species becomes their responsibility. A further concern are the community-acquired MRSA and C. difficile strains, and other antibiotic resistant strains circulating in the community such as the Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli. In response to concerns about such organisms in the community, the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has produced a report evaluating MRSA, C. difficile, and ESBL-producing E. coli from a community viewpoint. The report summarizes what is known about their prevalence in the community, their mode of transmission in the home, and the extent to which they represent a risk. It also includes “advice sheets” giving practical guidance on what to do when there is a risk of infection transmission in the home.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
