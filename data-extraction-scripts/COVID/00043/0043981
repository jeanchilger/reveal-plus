Microarray techniques show promise in this regard, as their high throughput nature can potentially detect a range of viruses using a single test. In this paper we present an array that can detect a wide spectrum of 169 plant virus species from 13 different genera. The array was constructed using an automated probe design protocol which generated a minimal number of probes to detect viruses at the genus level. The designed arrays showed a high specificity and sensitivity when tested with a set of standard virus samples. Field samples collected from a severe disease outbreak of Panax notoginseng farms in Yunnan, China, in 2001 were screened, where a potyvirus infection was identified associated with the disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
