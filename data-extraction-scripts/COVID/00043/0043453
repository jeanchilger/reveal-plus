<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Noninfectious Acute Lung Injury Syndromes Early After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</TITLE><BODY>Noninfectious acute lung injury syndromes are major causes of respiratory failure and early mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Pulmonary edema and transfusion-related acute lung injuries are important respiratory complications seen after HSCT and in the nontransplant setting. Early transplant-specific causes of lung injury, such as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, are reviewed. Several complications, such as drug-induced pneumonitis and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, that occur in both the early and later time periods after HSCT are also briefly discussed. The important role of pretransplant pulmonary function testing measurements in predicting posttransplant respiratory failure is highlighted.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
