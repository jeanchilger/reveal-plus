The past 15 years has seen a more uniform, world-wide approach to the management of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock with improved survival. Recognizing the early symptoms and signs of sepsis are key: the confused, hypoxic, hypotensive patient with pyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and leucocytosis. Examination must include search for a source of infection and early drainage or debridement. Next to take appropriate cultures, give fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. If the picture does not improve over the next 6 hours step-up the treatment to include urine output monitoring, blood gases for base excess, lactate, haemoglobin and glucose. These will guide the management of vasopressors, insulin, fluids, transfusion and bicarbonate. If the hypotension persists (septic shock) the patient should be moved to intensive care. The most recent recommendations include the withdrawal of starch based colloids, dobutamine in place of dopamine and a higher threshold for the use of steroids. This should be instituted within 24 hours of the start of sepsis. Advanced care includes mechanical ventilation using the ARDSnet protocol. Prevention by screening, stopping cross infection and appropriate use of antibiotics remains the first priority.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
