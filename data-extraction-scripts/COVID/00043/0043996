The rare cyclopropyl sterol (24S,28S)-24,28-methylenestigmast-5-en-3β-ol, previously detected as only 0.07% of the total sterols of a pelagophytic alga Pulvinaria sp., made up 6.6% of the total sterols. These sterols are believed to be the biosynthetic precursors of the antiviral orthoesterols and weinbersterols found in the same sponge. Based on the side chains of the isolated sterols, the absolute configurations of the antiviral steroid side chains are assigned to be (24R,28S)- for orthoesterol B, (24R)- for orthoesterol C, and (24S,28S)- for weinbersterols A and B.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
