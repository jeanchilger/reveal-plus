Rectal swab samples were subjected to a nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, specific for the conservative nucleocapsid region of the virus genome. More than 30% of the sampled animals proved positive for the presence of feline coronaviruses. The nucleotide sequences of amplified 440 bp products were determined, aligned and the phylogenetic analysis revealed noticeable genetic clusters among the prevalent feline coronaviruses in the surveyed geographic area. These findings will hopefully contribute to the elucidation of the epidemiology of feline infectious peritonitis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
