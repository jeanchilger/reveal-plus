These are 5′ and 3′ coterminal since they are composed of a leader and a body sequence, which are identical to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome, respectively. Previously, it has been suggested thatcis-splicing of a genome-length precursor RNA is involved in their synthesis. This was reevaluated in a comparative analysis of the sg RNA synthesis of EAV, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and the alphavirus Sindbis virus. UV transcription mapping showed that the majority of the EAV sg RNAs made at later stages of infection is not derived from a genome-length precursor. However, complete independence of sg RNA synthesis from that of genomic RNA was never observed during the course of infection. The possibility that this resulted from UV irradiation-induced effects on the synthesis of the viral replicase was investigated by inhibiting translation using cycloheximide. For EAV, ongoing protein synthesis was found to be more important for the synthesis of sg RNA than for that of genomic RNA. In general, MHV transcription was extremely sensitive to translation inhibition, whereas EAV genomic RNA synthesis became independent ofde novoprotein synthesis late in infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
