While wild-type G forms an oligomer in the RER, ts045 G synthesized at the nonpermissive temperature does not. When the permissive temperature is reinstated, ts045 G forms an oligomer and moves to the Golgi. The state of oligomerization was determined by chemical cross-linking and by the ability of a microinjected monoclonal antibody specific for the carboxy-terminal five amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of G to cause patching of G in intracellular membranes. We conclude that formation of an oligomer of G protein, probably a trimer, is necessary for G protein maturation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
