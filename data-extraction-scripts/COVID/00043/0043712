To permit analysis of the host range and entry mechanism of SARS-CoV, we incorporated the humanized SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein into HIV particles to generate a highly infectious SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus. The infection on Vero E6—a permissive cell line to SARS-CoV—could be neutralized by sera from convalescent SARS patients, and the entry was a pH-dependent process. With these highly infectious SARS-CoV pseudotypes, several cell lines derived from various tissues were revealed as susceptible to SARS-CoV, which were highly corresponding to the expression pattern of virus’s receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In addition, we also demonstrated angiotensin 1 converting enzyme (ACE)—the homologue of ACE2 could not function as a receptor for SARS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
