<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>A One Health Approach to Tackle Cryptosporidiosis</TITLE><BODY>Cryptosporidiosis is a significant diarrhoeal disease in both people and animals across the world and is caused by several species of the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium. Recent research has highlighted the longer-term consequences of the disease for malnourished children, involving growth stunting and cognitive deficits, and significant growth and production losses for livestock. There are no vaccines currently available to prevent the disease and few treatment options in either humans or animals, which has been a significant limiting factor in disease control to date. A One Health approach to tackle zoonotic cryptosporidiosis looking at new advances in veterinary, public, and environmental health research may offer several advantages and new options to help control the disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
