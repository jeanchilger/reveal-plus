Thus, it is quite obvious to expect that in coming decades there will be an even greater number of new chlorine-containing pharmaceuticals in market. Chlorinated compounds represent the family of compounds promising for use in medicinal chemistry. This review describes the recent advances in the synthesis of chlorine containing heterocyclic compounds as diverse biological agents and drugs in the pharmaceutical industries for the inspiration of the discovery and development of more potent and effective chlorinated drugs against numerous death-causing diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
