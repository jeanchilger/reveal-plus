Modeling of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in cerebral organoids have helped us understand its association with microcephaly. Similarly, the pathogenesis of bacterial (Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile) and viral (Norovirus, Rotaviruses) infections have been precisely dissected in organoid cultures. Additionally, direct associations between microbial colonization of tissues and diseases like cancer have also been deciphered. Here we discuss the most recent and striking studies on host–microbe interactions in organoid cultures, highlighting various methods which can be used for developing microbe-organoid co-culture systems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
