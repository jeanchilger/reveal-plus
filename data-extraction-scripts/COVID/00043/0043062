<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-12-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Plant tissue distribution and chemical inactivation of six carnation viruses</TITLE><BODY>Carnation mottle virus (CarMV), Carnation etched ring virus (CERV), Carnation vein mottle virus (CVMV), Carnation ringspot virus (CRSV), Carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) and Carnation latent virus (CLV) are the most important viruses affecting carnation crops. All except CERV are RNA viruses. Viral RNA or DNA accumulation on root, stem, leaf, sepal, petal, stamen, pistil and ovary tissues of infected carnation or Saponaria vaccaria plants was analysed by non-isotopic molecular hybridisation. High-titres of CarMV, CRSV, CIRV, and CLV accumulated in all plant tissues whereas CERV and CVMV were irregularly distributed over the plant. High-titres of all viruses accumulated in leaf, petal, stamen, pistil, and ovary tissues, so leaves or petals are a good tissue for routine diagnosis. Six chemicals were evaluated for inactivation of all carnation viruses in infected extracts. Commercial bleach at 7% (v/v) or NaOH at 0.5% (w/v) was found to inactivate all viruses after 60 s treatment in a systemic S. vaccaria bioassay.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
