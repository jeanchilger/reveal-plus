The present study also investigated the moderating role of heuristic-systematic processing and self-efficacy in the relationship between social media exposure and risk perceptions. The findings of this study showed that social media exposure was positively related to forming risk perceptions. Moreover, heuristic-systematic processing and self-efficacy were found to moderate the impact of social media on risk perceptions. The interaction effects suggested that the role of social media in increasing risk perceptions of MERS was heighted by heuristic-systematic processing and self-efficacy. The results and implications of this study are discussed in greater details.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
