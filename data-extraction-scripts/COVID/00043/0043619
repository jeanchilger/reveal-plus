Recent observations in vitro show that coronaviruses are released from a specific side of these polarized cells, and this polarized release might be important for the spread of the infection in vivo. Mechanisms for the directional sorting of coronaviruses might be similar to those governing the polar release of secretory proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
