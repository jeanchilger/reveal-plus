Viral excretion was measured daily by two means-deep nasal swabs and air samples obtained in a cyclone sampler. Clinical signs were very slight on infected pigs. Airborne virus could be recovered from day 1 to day 6 post-infection in the cyclone sampler as well as in petri dishes placed in the same loose-box. Viral titres obtained from nasal swabs were significantly correlated with those obtained from air samples. Different collection media were compared. The most efficient media for the collection of infectious viral particles contained a protective agent such as foetal calf serum.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
