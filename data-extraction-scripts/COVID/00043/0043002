<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>In vitro anti-hepatitis B and SARS virus activities of a titanium-substituted-heteropolytungstate</TITLE><BODY>Abstract A structural determined heteropolytungstate, [K4(H2O)8Cl][K4(H2O)4PTi2W10O40]·NH2OH 1, has been synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antiviral activities against hepatitis B (HBV) and SARS virus. The identity and high purity of compound 1 were confirmed by elemental analysis, NMR, IR analysis and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The compound 1, evaluated in HepG 2.2.15 cells expressing permanently HBV, significantly reduced the levels of HBV antigens and HBV DNA in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. EC50 values were determined to be 54μM for HBeAg, 61μM for HBsAg and 2.66μM for supernatant HBV DNA, as compared to 1671, 1570, 169μM, respectively, for the commercially-available hepatitis B drug adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). Intracellular cccDNA, pgRNA and HBcAg were also found to be decreased by compound 1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity results showed that compound 1 has low toxicity in HepG 2 cells with CC50 value of 515.20μM. The results indicate that compound 1 can efficiently inhibit HBV replication in HepG 2.2.15 cells line in vitro. Additionally, compound 1 also shows high anti-SARS activity at an EC50 of 7.08μM and toxicity with a CC50 of 118.6μM against MDCK cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
