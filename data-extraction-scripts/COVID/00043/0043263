S2 cells were cotransfected with four viral plasmids encoding EBOV Makona proteins and protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. We confirmed that EBOV Makona proteins were successfully expressed in S2 cells. Additionally, we further examined the formation of intracellular and extracellular VLPs by electron microscopy. eVLPs were produced by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of S2 cells transfected with EBOV Makona genes, and production of VLPs was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Collectively, our findings showed that the S2 cell system could be a promising tool for efficient production of eVLPs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
