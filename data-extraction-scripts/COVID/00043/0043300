TCoV was propagated in the 22-day-old turkey embryos. Intestines and intestinal contents of infected embryos were harvested and homogenized. After low speed centrifugation, the supernatant was concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a cushion of 30 or 60% sucrose solution, or by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The purification methods included sucrose gradient and Sephacryl S-1000 size-exclusion chromatography. Ultracentrifugation through a cushion of 60% sucrose solution was better than the other two methods for concentration of TCoV from intestinal homogenate. The most effective method for purifying TCoV and removing extraneous materials was size-exclusion chromatography as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. More spike-rich particles were observed in the sample purified by chromatography than those purified by sucrose gradient as examined by electron microscopy. Differentiation of turkey anti-TCoV antiserum from normal turkey serum was better achieved by ELISA plates coated with TCoV preparation purified by size-exclusion chromatography than that purified by sucrose density gradient. The results indicated that Sephacryl S-1000 chromatography was useful for purification of TCoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
