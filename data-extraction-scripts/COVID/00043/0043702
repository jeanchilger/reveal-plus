<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Avian Influenza: Are We Ready?</TITLE><BODY>The threat of an H5N1 influenza virus (avian flu) pandemic is substantial, and an effective response is contingent upon effective coordination among state and local public health authorities and individual health care providers. It is imperative that critical care nurses take an active role in the plans to meet the demands that will be placed on the health care system. This can be accomplished by developing an understanding of the etiology and manifestations of the virus, and becoming familiar with recent advances in research that address the demands of a pandemic. Equally important are the ethical considerations our state of preparedness will pose on the health care system, the community, and health care workers, both professionally and personally.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
