Thirty pigs seronegative to PRRSV and H. parasuis were divided into four groups. Group A pigs (10 animals) were inoculated with both virus and bacteria; group B pigs (10 animals) were inoculated with bacteria, group C pigs (five animals) were inoculated with virus and group D pigs (five animals) were kept as negative controls. All pigs of groups A and C became infected with PRRSV, according to virological techniques used (immunohistochemistry, virus isolation and virus serology). Lung, heart and tonsils were the most frequently immunolabeled tissues, and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells were the target for PRRSV in all tissues. All pigs in groups A and B also became infected with H. parasuis based on immunohistochemical and bacterial isolation results. Serosal surfaces, lung and tonsils were the most frequently immunolabeled tissues, and bacteria were found in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells as well as within neutrophil cytoplasm. No differences in terms of bacterial distribution or localization in tissues of pigs of groups A and B were detected. These results suggest that there is no influence of the previous infection with PRRSV in the occurrence of H. parasuis infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
