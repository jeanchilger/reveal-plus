The compound 6 showed good antiviral activity with EC(50) value 0.03 μM (SI = 8) against VSV in Hela and HEL cell lines. However, the lead compound 4 and its derivatives 5, 6 and 7 showed no remarkable activity against HIV-1 and other viruses. Molecular docking studies with HIV-1 RT using DS 2.5 and pymol softwares have shown marked differences in the interaction patterns between the lead compound 4 and AZT.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
