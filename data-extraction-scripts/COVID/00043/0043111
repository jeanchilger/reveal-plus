A total of 23 health care personnel from various disciplines and health care settings completed the self-administered Web-based survey. Differences in knowledge and self-identified training needs were found among disciplines. Future research may well focus on further exploring specific needs of different disciplines. These results will be used to inform topics to cover in infection control curricula for clinicians, public health professionals, and allied health personnel.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
