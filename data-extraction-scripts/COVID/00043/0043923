Four days later, he developed fever, sore throat and cervical lymphadenopathy, compatible with mononucleosis-like illness (MLI). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture of the nasopharyngeal swab showed human metapneumovirus (hMPV). There was a ≥4-fold rise in IgG against hMPV. This is the first case report illustrating the natural clinical course of hMPV-related MLI.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
