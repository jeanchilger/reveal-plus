The adaptability of complex antigen-specific T cell repertoires allows the host to respond to a diverse array of pathogens and accommodate memory pools to many pathogens in a finite immune system. This is in part accounted for by crossreactive memory T cells, which can be employed in immune responses and mediate protective immunity or life-threatening immunopathology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
