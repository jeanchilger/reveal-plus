Clinical tick-borne diseases in dogs and cats are discussed. We demonstrate that there is much interest in tickborne infections at the level of the lay public (pet owners), describe trends in the distribution and prevalence of tickborne infections in the U.S., summarize some issues in understanding the degree of ill health due to tickborne infections, and suggest some avenues for research that would clarify these issues.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
