<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-07-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Long-term follow-up of laminin α2 (merosin)-deficient muscular dystrophy in a cat</TITLE><BODY>Progressive muscle weakness beginning at 6 months of age was observed in a male Persian-mix cat. Muscle atrophy and joint contracture progressed over the next 3 years. The cat had developed gait difficulty at 8 months of age. The cat died at age of 5 years and 3 months due to an acute respiratory disorder. The clinical, laboratory, necropsy and histopathological findings of the cat were consistent with those of muscular dystrophy. The cat was diagnosed as having laminin α2 (merosin)-deficient muscular dystrophy on the basis of immunohistochemical findings. The cat was born in an inbred colony, and another related cat exhibited similar clinical signs. Few cases of laminin α2-deficient muscular dystrophy have been reported in cats, and this report provides additional information about the disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
