CoV primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract; however, SARS-CoV has a unique pathogenesis because it infects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts and leads to human respiratory diseases. SARS-CoV genome has shown containing 14 open reading frames (ORFs) and 8 of them encode novel proteins. Previous reports show that overexpression of ORF-3a, ORF-3b and ORF-7a induce apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrate that overexpression of ORF-6 also induces apoptosis and that Caspase-3 inhibitor and JNK inhibitor block ORF-6 induced apoptosis. Importantly, the protein level of ER chaperon protein, GRP94, was up-regulated when ORF-6 was overexpressed. All these data suggest that ORF-6 induces apoptosis via Caspase-3 mediated, ER stress and JNK-dependent pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
