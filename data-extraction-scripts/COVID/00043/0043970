<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Airborne infectious disease and the suppression of pulmonary bioaerosols</TITLE><BODY>The current understanding of airborne pathogen spread in relation to the new methods of suppressing exhaled bioaerosols using safe surface-active materials, such as isotonic saline, is reviewed here. We discuss the physics of bioaerosol generation in the lungs, what is currently known about the relationship between expired bioaerosols and airborne infectious disease and current methods of airborne infectious disease containment. We conclude by reviewing recent experiments that suggest the delivery of isotonic saline can significantly diminish exhaled aerosol – generated from airway lining fluid in the course of natural breathing. We also discuss these implications in relation to airborne infectious disease control.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
