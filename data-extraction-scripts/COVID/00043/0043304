Furthermore, we developed Cu(2+)/TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam and investigated the reduction in viral infection ratio. The method for evaluation of antibacterial activity of TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam could also be applied to evaluation of antiviral activity. We showed that Cu(2+)/TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam reduced the viral infection ratio to a greater extent than TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam. Our findings suggest that the infection risk by polluted air could be decreased using Cu(2+)/TiO(2)-coated cordierite foam in air cleaners.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
