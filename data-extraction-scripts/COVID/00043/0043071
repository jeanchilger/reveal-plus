<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-05-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Mycoplasma pneumoniae: Usual suspect and unsecured Diagnosis in the acute setting</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common known bacterial pathogens of the respiratory tract, especially in patients between 5 and 30 years of age. It may be encountered at a relatively high rate in the non-life-threatened fraction of Emergency Department (ED) patients presenting with upper respiratory symptoms or cough. Yet its hallmarks are very non-specific, including a great variety of presentations from mild pharyngitis to potentially life-threatening complications such as the Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Here, we describe a typical case of pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in a young adult with mild pharyngitis as the leading symptom. Disease presentation, complications, diagnostic means, therapeutic options, and suspicious clinical settings are discussed to provide a review on the clinical aspects of the disease that are important in the ED setting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
