Four lipophilic ester derivatives of EGCG, namely EGCG-O-tetrastearate, EGCG-O-tetraeicosapentaenoate, EGCG-O-tetradocosahexaenoate, and EGCG-O-octabutyrate, were prepared and evaluated for their antioxidant and antiviral activities in vitro. Incorporation of fatty acids, especially the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), into EGCG resulted in increased peroxyl radical scavenging activity, as measured by ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) assay, and metal chelation capacity. However, the esters exhibited decreased reducing power. Antiviral activities of EGCG derivatives were remarkably higher than the parent EGCG molecule, which showed relatively weak effects. The EGCG–PUFA esters were 1700-fold more effective in inhibiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease than the positive control embelin. The derivatives also acted as α-glucosidase inhibitors, suggesting their potential in anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) treatment. The results suggest that ester derivatives of EGCG with improved bioactivities may serve as excellent functional food ingredients and natural health products. Moreover, the omega-3 PUFA in the derivatives may also render additional or synergistic health benefits.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
