Inhomogeneous spread of SARS led one to think of an Asian genetic predisposition and contribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) to the disease susceptibility. However, past case-control studies showed inconsistent results. In Viet Nam, of 62 patients with SARS, 44 participated in the present study together with 103 individuals who had contact with SARS patients and 50 without contact history. HLA-DRB1*12 was more frequently shown in SARS patients than in controls (corrected p = 0.042). HLA-DRB1*1202, the predominant allele in the Vietnamese population showed the strongest association with SARS in a dominant model (corrected p = 0.0065 and 0.0052, depending on the controls to be compared). Our results and accumulated data on HLA in the Asian populations would help in the understanding of associations with emerging infectious diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
