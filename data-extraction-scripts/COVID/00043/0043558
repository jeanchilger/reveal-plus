<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 5 Category C Diseases and Agents</TITLE><BODY>Abstract This chapter covers Category C diseases and agents. These emerging diseases present a very unique challenge to public health officials and infectious disease specialists. Perhaps they have been with us for millions of years, lurking in a dark corner of the environment, waiting for an opportunity to jump from their natural cycle of transmission to a human host. Or they may represent something totally new. Regardless of their origin, an emerging disease pathogen must be characterized quickly by molecular biologists and microbiologists. The dynamics of disease transmission must be investigated by teams of epidemiologists. Treatment regimens must be formulated by clinicians working on the frontlines of the outbreak. Disease prevention strategies and risk communications must be quickly formulated by public health officials. Finally, media attention for emerging disease outbreaks forces government officials at all levels to address the problem with planning and preparedness activities aimed at preserving the health of the public. Specific examples explored in this chapter include Nipah virus, hantavirus, West Nile fever virus, and the coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
