Fifteen pregnant 3-month-old Wistar rats were separated into 3 groups. On the 15th and 17th day of pregnancy all animals received an intravenous administration of 1 ml of 15 mg of NCs (Group A), 1 ml of 5 mg NCs (Group B) while Control group received 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl. On the 14th and 17th of pregnancy ultrasonography was performed and the parameters evaluated were the width of placenta, the length and width of the embryonic sac, the foetus length and the heart rate. On parturition the number of pups per dam was evaluated. Half of the pups were euthanised the day after parturition and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated and for the rest of the pups the body growth curve was evaluated until the age of 14 week. At the end of the 14th week the remaining pups were euthanised and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated. At weaning the dams were euthanised and their liver and kidney was histologically evaluated. Ultrasonography: Baseline measurements of the width of placenta, the length and width of embryonic sac, the foetus length and the heart rate on the 14th day of pregnancy, revealed no statistical significant differences between groups. Comparison of the same values on the 17th day of pregnancy after 2 intravenous administrations of NCs showed no statistical significant effect on the respective parameters. The administration of NCs had no impact on the mean number of pups per dam. Additionally, no impact of the NCs on the body weights of the pups was observed on the 1st day after parturition. Moreover, comparisons between groups, for both sexes showed no difference on growth rate. During the histological evaluation no inflammatory, degenerative or neoplastic lesions were observed as far as the newborn, adult offspring and dams were concerned. According to our results no toxic impact of the low and high doses of the NCs was observed on the parameters selected to be evaluated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
