<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 18 Family Arteriviridae</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The family Arteriviridae is one of four families in the order Nidovirales. Arteriviruses are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses with genomes of 12.7–15.7kb. The overall genome organization and gene expression strategy of the arteriviruses is highly similar to the coronaviruses. Notably they use a discontinuous transcription strategy for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs. There are no recognized human pathogens among the arteriviruses. Members of the family include equine arteritis virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, the latter an economically important pathogen of pigs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
