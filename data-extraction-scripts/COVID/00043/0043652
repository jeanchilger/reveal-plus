<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)</TITLE><BODY>The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a novel lethal zoonotic disease of humans caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although MERS is endemic to the Middle East, travelers have exported MERS-CoV on return to their home countries. Clinical manifestations range from mild to severe acute respiratory disease and death. The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with chronic comorbid liver, lung, and hepatic conditions have a high mortality rate. There is no specific treatment. Person-to-person spread causes hospital and household outbreaks, and thus improved compliance with internationally recommended infection control protocols and rapid implementation of infection control measures are required.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
