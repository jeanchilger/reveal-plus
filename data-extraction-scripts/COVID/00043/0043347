The development and optimization of three quantitative reverse transcription real time polymerase chain reactions (RT Real Time Qt-PCRs) and an indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) for the detection and quantitation of HPIV-1, -2 and -3 in clinical samples are described. Efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, inter- and intra-assay variability and turnaround time of the two methods were compared. These assays have been validated on 131 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Based on the results obtained, the molecular methods represent a valid and rapid tool for clinical management and should be included in diagnostic panels aimed to evaluate suspected respiratory tract infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
