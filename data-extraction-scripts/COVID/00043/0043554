Consequently, emerging respiratory viruses are a continuing threat to global health security and have the potential to affect our economies. Since the millennium, there have been around a dozen different outbreaks, several capturing international interest. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus saw the beginning of an extensive global collaboration and has influenced many outbreak preparedness protocols now in place.
