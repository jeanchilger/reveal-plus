Overall, 9.3% of the diarrheic fecal samples tested positive for BNoVs by either RT-PCR or nested PCR, of which 5.9% samples also tested positive for other enteric pathogens including the bovine coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine torovirus, bovine groups A, B and C rotaviruses, bovine enteric Nebraska-like calicivirus and Escherichia coli. The genetic diversity was determined by direct sequencing of the partial RdRp region of 12 BNoVs detected from the fecal samples by nested PCR. Among the BNoVs examined, one Korean BNoV strain had the highest nucleotide (86.8%) and amino acid (99.1%) identity with the genotype 1 BNoV (GIII-1) strain, while the remaining 11 Korean BNoVs shared a higher nucleotide (88.0–90.5%) and amino acid (93.5–99.1%) identity with the genotype 2 BNoV (GIII-2) strains. The phylogenetic data for the nucleotide and amino acid sequences also demonstrated that one Korean BNoV strain clustered with GIII-1 but the remaining eleven strains clustered with GIII-2. In conclusion, BNoV infections are endemic and there are two distinct genotypes with GIII-2 being the main genotype circulating in the calf population in South Korea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
