Phylogenetic analysis, network tree, similarity plot analysis, Recombination Detection Program 4(RDP4) and sequence comparison revealed that 12 of the 20 isolates were likely the reisolated vaccine virus. One isolate, ck/CH/LSD/110857, was shown to have originated from recombination events between H120- and 4/91-like vaccine strains that did not result in changes of antigenicity and pathogenicity. The remaining seven IBV isolates were shown to have originated from recombination events between a 4/91-like vaccine strain and a GX-LY9-like virus, which were responsible for the emergence of a novel serotype. A vaccination-challenge test found that vaccination with the 4/91 vaccine strain did not provide protection against challenge with the recombinant viruses. In addition, the results showed that the recombination events between the vaccine and field strains resulted in altered genetics, serotype, antigenicity, and pathogenicity compared with those of their deduced parental viruses. The results are important not only because this virus is of economic importance to poultry industry, but also because it is important for elucidating the origin and evolution of other coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
