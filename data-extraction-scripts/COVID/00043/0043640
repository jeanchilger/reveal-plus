Thermogram is a promising front-line screening tool as it is able to warn women of breast cancer up to 10 years in advance. However, analysis and interpretation of thermogram are heavily dependent on the analysts, which may be inconsistent and error-prone. In order to boost the accuracy of preliminary screening using thermogram without incurring additional financial burden, Complementary Learning Fuzzy Neural Network (CLFNN), FALCON-AART is proposed as the Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) tool for thermogram analysis. CLFNN is a neuroscience-inspired technique that provides intuitive fuzzy rules, human-like reasoning, and good classification performance. Confluence of thermogram and CLFNN offers a promising tool for fighting breast cancer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
