Monoclonal antibodies directed against previously defined epitopes on the viral proteins were used as probes to detect viral protein synthesis and processing, as well as expression in animal tissues. Circulating polyclonal antibodies were also probed and characterized for their polypeptide specificities. Under appropriate conditions, this Western immunoblotting technique was quantitative. Finally, a highly sensitive dot immunoblotting assay was used to analyze the sensitivity to denaturation of various epitopes on the viral proteins. This assay detected picogram quantities of viral antigens and antibodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
