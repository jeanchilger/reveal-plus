Here, we showed that the down-regulation of E is not dependent on the lysine residues on 8b and the reduction of polyubiquitination of E mutants is not correlated with their down-regulation by 8b, suggesting an ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway is involved. A time-course study revealed that 8b was expressed at late-stages of SARS-CoV infection. By using Vero E6 cells stably expressing green fluorescence protein-tagged 8b, ectopic expression of 8b was shown to significantly reduce the production of progeny virus and down-regulate E expression. Taken together, these results suggest that 8b negatively modulates virus replication by down-regulating E via an ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
