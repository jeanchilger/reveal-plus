In recent decades, DNA has received considerable attention for its functionality and versatility, allowing it to help bridge the gap between materials science and biological systems. The use of DNA as a structural nanoscale material has opened a new avenue towards the rational design of DNA nanostructures with different polymeric topologies. These topologies, in turn, possess unique characteristics that translate to specific therapeutic and diagnostic strategies within nanomedicine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
