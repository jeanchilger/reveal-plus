The best inducer found was Newcastle disease virus (NDV), followed by two coronaviruses (porcine TGEV and a bovine coronavirus). Interferon was also produced by leucocytes stimulated with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus-infected and glutaraldehyde-fixed cells, but the titre was much lower. The secretion of interferon stimulated by NDV was detectable 24 h after induction. The interferon so obtained protected young trout against VHSV when injected at the time of infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
