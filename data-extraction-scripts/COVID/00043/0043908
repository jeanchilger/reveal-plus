The proposed structure provided efficient penetration of virions into sensitive layer and trapping of them. Adsorption of the viruses led to significant shift of resonant frequency of DEPSi coupled with a coil, measured by impedance spectrometer. The detection limit of virions was lower than 100 TCID50. The results can be used for invention of H1N1 sensor, which provide rapid, label-free and low-cost detection of influenza.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
