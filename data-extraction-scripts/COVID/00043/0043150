The peaks of the immune responses to both MBP and TMEV coincide with the time course of the clinical signs of disease. Adsorption of mouse sera with TMEV or MBP indicate the non-identity of the antigens and the specificity of the antisera as measured by ELISA. Immunoblot analysis of sera confirmed the ELISA findings. The mechanism of induction of antibody directed against MBP and its role in TMEV-associated demyelination remain to be determined.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
