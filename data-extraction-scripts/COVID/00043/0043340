<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>25 Host Defenses to Viruses</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Virus infections continue to pose a substantial threat to human health. Unravelling the intricacies of immune defenses against viruses should lead to improved control of infections through the design of new vaccines and therapies. Our understanding of the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the immune systems response to virus infection has improved substantially in recent years. This wealth of new information and the promise of new insight from systems biology approaches continue to drive research in this field. Such knowledge has revealed why viruses sometimes induce immune dysfunction or trigger disastrous pathology and has paved the way for new therapies being tested against chronic and emerging infections. In this chapter, we briefly summarize the general concepts in immunity to virus infections and highlight some of the key challenges remaining for the future. Virus infections continue to pose a substantial threat to human health.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
