There is a wide spectrum of disease severity and viral pathogens are common. After a careful history and physical examination, chest radiographs may be the only diagnostic test required. The first step in management is risk stratification, using a validated clinical decision rule and serum lactate, followed by early antibiotics and fluid resuscitation when indicated.
