Identification of sustainable and effective measures to mitigate PRRSV transmission is a pressing problem. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV plays a crucial role in inhibiting host innate immunity during PRRSV infection. In the current study, a new host-restricted factor, tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), was identified as an inhibitor of PRRSV replication. Co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the PRRSV N protein interferes with TRIM25–RIG-I interactions by competitively interacting with TRIM25. Furthermore, N protein inhibits the expression of TRIM25 and TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination to suppress interferon β production. Furthermore, with increasing TRIM25 expression, the inhibitory effect of N protein on the ubiquitination of RIG-I diminished. These results indicate for the first time that TRIM25 inhibits PRRSV replication and that the N protein antagonizes the antiviral activity by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. This not only provides a theoretical basis for the development of drugs to control PRRSV replication, but also better explains the mechanism through which the PRRSV N protein inhibits innate immune responses of the host.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
