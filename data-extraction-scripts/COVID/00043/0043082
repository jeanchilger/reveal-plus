<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-01-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Antibiotics</TITLE><BODY>This chapter describes the optimal approach to antibiotic treatment of exacerbations recognizing these limitations. Such an approach relies upon an accurate diagnosis of an exacerbation, including judicious application of diagnostic tests. Determining the severity of an exacerbation follows this. If antibiotics are indicated, then a risk stratification approach is described to choose an appropriate antibiotic. An increase in airway inflammation from the baseline level in a patient appears central to the pathogenesis of most acute exacerbations. Airway inflammation measured in induced or expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial biopsy has revealed that increased inflammation accompanies exacerbations and resolves with treatment. Potential pathogens in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations include typical respiratory bacterial pathogens, respiratory viruses, and atypical bacteria. The current model of bacterial exacerbation pathogenesis involves both host and pathogen factors. Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment is the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation. The traditional aims of treatment of an exacerbation are improvement in clinical status and the prevention of complications. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of COPD exacerbations has been a matter of controversy. Even more contentious has been the issue whether antibiotic choice is relevant to clinical outcome of exacerbations. Recommendations for antibiotic use among published guidelines are inconsistent.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
