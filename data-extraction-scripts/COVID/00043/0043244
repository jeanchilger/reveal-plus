The coding regions of the chicken and turkey genes are highly conserved, with IL-10 and IL-13 exhibiting 94.1% and 90% nucleotide and 92% and 79.9% amino acid identity respectively. Both showed consistent mRNA expression in turkey lymphoid and gut tissues. Expression in non-lymphoid tissues was more variable but generally highest in the skin and trachea. Recombinant turkey IL-10 was expressed and bioactivity demonstrated by inhibition of IFN-γ synthesis from activated splenocytes. Chicken and turkey IL-10 cross-reacted in functional assays.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
