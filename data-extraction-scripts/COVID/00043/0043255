In this situational framework, patients and front-line healthcare workers are vulnerable. Method : Studies were identified using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. Results : Populations of patients that may require tailored interventions are older adults and international migrant workers. Older adults with psychiatric conditions may be experiencing further distress. The COVID-19 epidemic has underscored potential gaps in mental health services during emergencies. Conclusions : Most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training for providing mental health care. Fear seems more certainly a consequence of mass quarantine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
