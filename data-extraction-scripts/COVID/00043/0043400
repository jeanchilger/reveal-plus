The U.S. Healthy People 2010 initiative set a national goal of 60% coverage for HCW influenza vaccination by 2010. Yet vaccination rates remain low. In the 2008–2009 influenza season, Flushing Hospital Medical Center (FHMC; New York) adopted a “push/pull” point-of-dispensing (POD) vaccination model that was derived from emergency preparedness planning for mass vaccination and/or prophylaxis to respond to an infectious disease outbreak, whether occurring naturally or due to bioterrorism. Launch of the HCW Vaccination Program In mid-September 2008, a two-week HCW vaccination program was launched using a sequential POD approach. In Push POD, teams assigned to specific patient units educated all HCWs about influenza vaccination and offered on-site vaccination; vaccinated HCWs received a 2009 identification (ID) validation sticker. In Pull POD, HCWs could enter the hospital only through one entrance; all other employee entrances were “locked down.” A 2009 ID validation sticker was required for entry and to punch in for duty. Employees without the new validation sticker were directed to a nearby vaccination team. After the Push/Pull POD was completed, the employee vaccination drive at FHMC was continued for the remainder of the influenza season by the Employee Health Service. Results Using this model, in two days 72% of the employees were reached, with 54% of those reached accepting vaccination. Conclusions This model provides a novel approach for institutions to improve their HCW influenza vaccination rates within a limited period through exercising emergency preparedness plans for infectious disease outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
