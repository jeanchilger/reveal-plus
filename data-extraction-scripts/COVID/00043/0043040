In our previous study, immunization of mice with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) spike (S) DNA vaccine could induce both humoral and cellular immunity in response to a pool of entire overlapping S peptides. Identification of functional dominant epitopes in SARS CoV S protein for T cells is crucial for further understanding of cellular immune responses elicited by SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. In present study, mice were immunized with SARS CoV S DNA vaccine. Subsequently, a pool of 17–19 mers overlapped SARS CoV S peptides, which served as immunogens, were scanned to identify the specific epitopes for T cells. Two H-2(d) restricted CD4(+) T epitopes, N60 (S435–444) and P152 (S1111–1127), and two H-2(d) restricted CD8(+) T cell epitopes, N50 (S365–374) and P141 (S1031–1047) were identified by three different methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). The dominant CD4(+) T cell epitope (N60) and CD8(+) T cell epitope (N50) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS CoV S protein, which mediated virus combining and fusing to susceptible cells. Importantly, our novel finding is that mice primed with SARS S DNA vaccine and boosted with T cell epitopes (N50 and N60) could promote antigen specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell immune responses. Our study provides valuable information for the design of vaccine for SARS study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
