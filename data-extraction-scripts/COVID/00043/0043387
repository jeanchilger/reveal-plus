Recently, non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in diverse biological contexts. Long non-coding RNAs control gene expression in the nucleus by modulating transcription or via post-transcriptional mechanisms targeting the splicing, stability or translation of mRNAs. Our knowledge of lncRNA biogenesis, their cell-type specific expressions, and their versatile molecular functions are rapidly progressing in all areas of biology. Here we discuss these exciting new regulators and highlight an emerging paradigm of lncRNA-mediated control of gene expression in the immune system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
