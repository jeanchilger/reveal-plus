TLR4 has been implicated in innate immunity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by an interaction with the viral envelope fusion (F) protein. Sendai virus (mouse parainfluenza type 1) shares many features with RSV, including a structurally and functionally similar F protein. To determine the role of TLR4 in host defense against Sendai virus respiratory tract infection, TLR4 mutant and wildtype mice were intranasally infected with Sendai virus. Sendai infection resulted in an increase in viral RNA copies in lung homogenates peaking on day 4. Pulmonary viral loads, histopathology, cytokine levels and leukocyte influx were similar in TLR4 mutant and wildtype mice. In spite of the structural similarities shared by the F proteins of Sendai virus and RSV, TLR4 is not involved in host defense against respiratory tract infection with Sendai virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
