Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is an important cytokine that plays a critical role in the inflammatory and immune responses. Although IL-17 family members have been extensively studied in mammals, our knowledge of the activity of IL-17 proteins in teleosts in response to viral infection is still limited. In this study, the role of IL-17 in GCRV infection and its mechanism were investigated. The expression levels of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells gradually increased from 6 h after infection with GCRV. The nuclear translocation of p65, which acts in the NF-κB signaling pathway, was also increased by GCRV infection. The overexpression of IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, or IL-17AF3 also promoted the nuclear translocation of p65 and the levels of phospho-IκBα in CIK cells, and reduced the expression of the viral structural protein VP7. An NF-κB signal inhibitor abolished the inhibition of GCRV infection by IL-17 proteins. These results suggested that the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated by the overexpression of IL-17 proteins, resulting in the inhibition of viral infection. In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated that IL-17AF1, IL-17AF2, and IL-17AF3 acted as immune cytokines, exerting an antiviral effect by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
