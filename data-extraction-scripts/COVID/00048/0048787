Methods EF were incubated at 37 °C anaerobically with rabbit intestinal flora, and then water-saturated ethyl acetate was used for sample extraction at different time points. Furthermore, gluconolactone was added at different concentrations (8, 12 and 16 mg·mL−1) to study its inhibition of the metabolism of EF in rabbit intestinal flora. The separation was performed on a ODS column by gradient elution with acetonitrile-water (including 0.1% formic acid respectively) as mobile phase at detection wavelength of 335 nm. Results EF were metabolized to icariside II in 2 h, and then to icaritin when incubated for 8 h; gluconolactone showed the inhibition of EF metabolism in rabbit intestinal flora in a concentration-dependent manner. Conclusion EF were found to be metabolized rapidly by hydrolysis of rabbit intestinal flora to produce icariside II and icaritin; and the total inhibition was achieved by gluconolactone at a concentration of 16 mg·mL−1.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
