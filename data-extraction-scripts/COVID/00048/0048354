Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have greatly contributed to our understanding of protein–membrane interactions, promoted by a dramatic development of MD-related software, increasingly accurate force fields, and available computer power. In this chapter, we present available methods for studying protein–membrane systems with MD simulations, including an overview about the various all-atom and coarse-grained force fields for lipids, and useful software for membrane simulation setup and analysis. A large set of case studies is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
