All cis- and trans-isoxazolidine phosphonates obtained herein were assessed for antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. Isoxazolidines trans-9d and trans-9f exhibited the highest activity (EC50 =8.9μM) toward cytomegalovirus. Compounds cis- and trans-9d as well as cis- and trans-9f were found potent against HSV and Vaccinia viruses (EC50 in the 45–58μM range), whereas isoxazolidines 10a and 10d suppressed replication of Coxsackie B4 and Punta Toro viruses (EC50 in the 45–73μM range). Antiproliferative evaluation of all obtained isoxazolidines revealed the promising activity of cis-9b, cis-9d, trans-9d, cis-9e, trans-9e, cis-9f and trans-9f toward tested cancer cell lines with IC50 in the 1.1–19μM range.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
