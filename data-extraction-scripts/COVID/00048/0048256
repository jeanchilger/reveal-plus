We recently established an in vitro model of EAV persistence in cell culture for the purpose of furthering our understanding of EAV biology in general and viral persistence in the stallion in particular. In this study we investigated whether persistently infected HeLa cells could be cured of EAV infection by treatment with an antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) designed to target the 5′-terminal region of the EAV genome. We found that persistently infected HeLa cells passaged three times in the presence of 5–10μM EAV-specific PPMO produced no detectable virus. The PPMO-cured HeLa cells were free of infectious virus, viral antigen and EAV RNA as measured by plaque assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay and RT-PCR, respectively. Furthermore, when re-challenged with EAV at several passages after discontinuation of PPMO treatments, PPMO-cured HeLa cells were found to be refractory to re-infection and to the re-establishment of viral persistence. While these findings demonstrate that PPMO can be used to eliminate persistent EAV infection in cell culture, the efficacy of PPMO against EAV in vivo remains to be addressed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
