The oceans no longer protected the United States from terrorists. And as incidences in the Philippines, Spain, Iraq, and other corners of the globe have found, no place on the planet can be considered risk-free. Unfortunately, not only must the world be concerned with acts of violence and destruction, but also with the threat of a more insidious nature—chemical and biological terrorism. According to a March 29, 2004, article in the New York Times, the Pentagon released parts of an unclassified document suggesting that the United States is “woefully ill-prepared to detect and respond to a bioterrorist assault.” In this article, our authors offer us a first-hand window into an important and regrettably necessary area of medicine that could affect us both as physicians and citizens in the twenty-first century. Fig 1 —The Editors Biochemical terrorism—the deliberate dispersion of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and organic or inorganic toxin agents, to kill, mutilate, and create chaos—is a real threat that all countries must cope with today. Both sovereign nations and terror organizations now have the capability to produce and use biochemical agents, and some of them have already demonstrated their eagerness to do so. The development of instant communication has been a further inducement to the terrorists. Each event is reported almost immediately in the media, bringing recognition and reputation to the executors (1–3).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
