SEIJR (susceptible, exposed, infected, diagnosed, recovered) model of SARS epidemic is considered with net in flow of individuals into a region. Transmission of disease is analyzed by solving the system of differential equations using numerical methods with different initial population distributions. The effect of diffusion on the spread of disease is examined. Stability is established for the numerical solutions. Effects of interventions (medical and non medical) are also analyzed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
