Clinical features and outcome A 33-year-old man with a history of heart failure developed pneumonia during hospitalization. After the standard antibiotic therapy for 3 days, he continued to experience persistent fever and progressive cough with purulent sputum. Broad spectrum antibiotics did not relieve the fever or the purulent sputum; therefore, the patient requested TCM for integrated therapy, and was subsequently treated with a regiment of “clearing heat and damp excreting” decoction according to TCM theory. After three days of TCM combination therapy, the pneumonia patches significantly improved on chest X-ray. His sputum was obviously decreased in amount and the fever was complete remission in the 5th day of TCM adjuvant therapy. Conclusion Integrated therapy with a “clearing heat and damp excreting” decoction may have improved hospital-acquired pneumonia in a patient comorbid with congestive heart failure. The anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory, antitussive and diuretic effects of TCM may be responsible for the observed improvement. Further experimental studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy and mechanism of TCM action in the treatment of pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
