This was associated with increasing carbapenem resistance reaching 35–54%, and by a dramatic increase in carbapenem consumption. In-hospital fatality rates ranged between 47% and 58% and were significantly higher than those seen with other nosocomial Gram-negative pathogens. A. baumannii was not restricted to intensive care units, but had spread to all hospital wards. Multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii has the potential to reach endemicity in hospitals and warrants more vigorous and innovative efforts to limit its spread.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
