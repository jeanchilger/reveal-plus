STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Outpatients and their caregivers who were present at an outpatient setting in Hong Kong were invited to participate in this survey. All participants were asked to complete a self-administered closed-ended questionnaire about their knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding the use of face masks. Data were described using descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Among the 399 respondents, 52% knew the correct steps in wearing a face mask, and their attitudes toward face masks were generally positive. Further analyses showed that respondents were more likely to wear a face mask at a clinic than in a public place or at home. Moreover, respondents were more likely to wear a face mask to protect others against influenza-like illness (ILI) than for self-protection. There was low to moderate correlation between attitudes and practices (correlation coefficient 0.26, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a knowledge gap in the correct use of face masks among outpatients and their caregivers; attitudes and practices regarding the use of face masks were generally positive, but correlation was not high. It is recommended that public health education campaigns should tailor efficient programmes to combat ILI transmission among outpatient clinic populations by improving knowledge about the correct use of face masks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
