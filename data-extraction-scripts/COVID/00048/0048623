In cells infected with avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three proteins of 100, 39, and 35 kDa, respectively, were previously identified as mature cleavage products released from the 1b region of the 1a/1b polyprotein by the 3C-like proteinase. In this report, we show the identification of two more cleavage products of 68 and 58 kDa released from the same region of the polyprotein. In addition, two stable intermediate cleavage products with molecular masses of 160 and 132 kDa, respectively, were identified in IBV-infected cells. The 160-kDa protein was shown to be an intermediate cleavage product covering the 100- and 68-kDa proteins, and the 132-kDa protein to be an intermediate cleavage product covering the 58-, 39-, and 35-kDa proteins. Immunofluorescent staining of IBV-infected cells and cells expressing individual cleavage products showed that the 100-, 68-, and 58-kDa proteins were associated with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the 39- and 35-kDa proteins displayed diffuse distribution patterns.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
