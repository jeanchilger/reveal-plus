While first described in viruses, it is becoming clear that sequences that program elongating ribosomes to shift translational reading frame are widely used by organisms in all domains of life, thus expanding both the coding capacity of genomes and the modes through which gene expression can be regulated at the posttranscriptional level. Instances of programmed ribosomal frameshifting and stop codon reassignment are opening up new avenues for treatment of numerous inborn errors of metabolism. The implications of these findings on human health are only beginning to emerge.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
