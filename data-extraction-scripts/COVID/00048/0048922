<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-04-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Anticorps monoclonaux : tours et détours technologiques pour de nouveaux espoirs thérapeutiques</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Engineering monoclonal antibodies, now widely used in the clinic, has made it possible to develop a new generation of antibodies with optimized functional properties. These antibodies should allow a significant improvement of the treatment of diseases where only few drugs are available, if any. However, the cost of treatments with monoclonal antibodies requires further improvements in production and purification technologies, and raises the question of generic antibodies. The present review summarizes some of the technological past and present challenges in the field. To cite this article: D. Bourel, J.-L. Teillaud, C. R. Biologies 329 (2006).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
