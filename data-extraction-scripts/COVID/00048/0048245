However, its clinical role and pathogenicity has not been known. Objectives To confirm that WU polyomavirus has been found in Chinese children. Study design WU polyomavirus was detected and identified using PCR methods. A total of 278 specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected, and then PCR products were sequenced directly. Results One of 278 nasopharyngeal aspirates was positive for WUPyV in one child, and the positive rate was 0.4%. The results showed that the sequences of genome, LTAg and VP2 gene was identical to the reference sequences of WU polyomavirus prototype strains. Conclusions We confirmed that WU polyomavirus had been found and identified in the respiratory secretions in China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
