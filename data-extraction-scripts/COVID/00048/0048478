<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-09-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Specific testing of textiles for transportation</TITLE><BODY>The use of textiles in transportation may be associated with the need to combine comfort and functionality. The evolution of each mean of transportation along with the increased awareness about the importance of passengers' safety pushed research and development forward towards a larger use of lightweight, fire-resistant, nontoxic, and durable textiles in transportation. This in turn led to the development of test methods assessing the different aspects of textiles in transportation. This chapter starts with a presentation of the transportation textile market. Then, different aspects of textile testing relevant to the transportation industry are discussed: safety, flammability, hygiene, performance of composite parts, and durability. The chapter ends with considerations regarding future trends for textiles in transportation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
