Methods We have performed a rapid, accurate laboratory confirmative method to simultaneously detect, quantify and differentiate CHIKV and DENV infection by single-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR. Results The assay's sensitivity was 97.65%, specificity was 92.59% and accuracy was 95.82% when compared to conventional RT-PCR. Additionally, there was no cross-reaction between CHIKV, DENV, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis C, hepatitis A or hepatitis E virus. Conclusions This rapid and reliable assay provides a means for simultaneous early diagnosis of CHIKV and DENV in a single-step reaction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
