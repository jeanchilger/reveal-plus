<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-08-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Large-scale integrated super-computing platform for next generation virtual drug discovery</TITLE><BODY>Traditional drug discovery starts by experimentally screening chemical libraries to find hit compounds that bind to protein targets, modulating their activity. Subsequent rounds of iterative chemical derivitization and rescreening are conducted to enhance the potency, selectivity, and pharmacological properties of hit compounds. Although computational docking of ligands to targets has been used to augment the empirical discovery process, its historical effectiveness has been limited because of the poor correlation of ligand dock scores and experimentally determined binding constants. Recent progress in super-computing, coupled to theoretical insights, allows the calculation of the Gibbs free energy, and therefore accurate binding constants, for usually large ligand–receptor systems. This advance extends the potential of virtual drug discovery. A specific embodiment of the technology, integrating de novo, abstract fragment based drug design, sophisticated molecular simulation, and the ability to calculate thermodynamic binding constants with unprecedented accuracy, are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
