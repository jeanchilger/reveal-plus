Methods A systematic literature search was carried out in Medline, Scielo, Lilacs, and Cochrane Library. The search strategy aimed at retrieving studies focusing on RSV prevalence, burden, risk factors, and the routine clinical practice in the prevention and management of RSV infections in Latin American countries. Only articles published between January 2011 and December 2017 were considered. Results Eighteen studies were included. Percentages of RSV detection varied highly across included studies for adult subjects with respiratory infections (0% to 77.9%), influenza-like illness (1.0% to 16.4%) and community-acquired pneumonia (1.3% to 13.5%). Considerable percentages of hospitalization were reported for RSV-infected adults with influenza-like illness (40.9% and 69.9%) and community-acquired pneumonia (91.7%). Conclusions Recent RSV data regarding adult populations in Latin America are scarce. RSV was documented as a cause of illness in adults and the elderly, being identified in patients with acute respiratory infections, influenza-like illness and community-acquired pneumonia. The studies suggest that RSV infections may be a significant cause of hospitalization in adult populations in Latin America, including younger adults.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
