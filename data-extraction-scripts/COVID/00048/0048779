According to the available surveillance data, only a few sporadic travel-associated MERS-CoV cases have been reported outside the Arabian Peninsula so far, mainly in Europe, North Africa, and Asia. These have resulted in no cases, or limited numbers of secondary cases except in Korea. The vast majority of viral respiratory infections in pilgrims returning home have been due to seasonal influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and other known coronaviruses distinct from the MERS coronavirus. Influenza vaccination should be a priority for all Hajj pilgrims, as recommended by experts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
