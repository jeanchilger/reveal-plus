However, no surveys concerning with the relation between respiratory symptoms and the detection of BToV have been conducted in wide range. Among 311 nasal samples, BToV gene products were detected in seven samples (rBToV-1 to -7) derived only from calves with respiratory symptoms, suggesting that BToV may be a predisposing factor and/or causative agent for bovine respiratory disease. Regarding the degree of similarity between the spike and hemagglutinin-esterase coding regions, the rBToVs showed over 90.8% similarity with one another and 73.5–99.0% similarity with fecal tract-derived BToVs. rBToV-1, -2, and -3 were identical despite their being collected during different seasons; in comparison, rBToV-4 and -5 were distinct despite the fact that they were collected from the same herd, suggesting the existence of diversity among domestic rBToVs. One animal with a BToV-positive nasal sample also shed the virus in its feces, suggesting dual tropisms for BToV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
