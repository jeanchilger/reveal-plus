The exocrine secretions of the body contain a plethora of distinct soluble factors (lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidases, proline-rich proteins, histatins, etc.) that protect the body from mucosal microbial pathogens. More recent studies have established that the humoral arm of innate immunity contains a heterogeneous group of pattern-recognition molecules (e.g., pentraxins, collectins, and ficolins), which perform diverse host-defense functions, such as agglutination and neutralization, opsonization, control of inflammation, and complement activation and regulation. These pattern-recognition molecules, which act as functional predecessors of antibodies (“ante-antibodies”), and the classic soluble innate defense factors form an integrated system with complementary specificity, action, and tissue distribution, and they are the subject of this chapter.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
