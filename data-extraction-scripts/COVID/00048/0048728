Passive immunization with anti-HMGB1 antibodies confers significant protection against lethal endotoxemia, sepsis, and acute lung injury, even when antibodies are administered after the onset of these diseases. In light of observations that three Chinese herbal formulations recommended for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) specifically inhibited the release of HMGB1 from innate immune cells, we hypothesize that HMGB1 might occupy a pathogenic role in SARS by mediating an injurious pulmonary inflammatory response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
