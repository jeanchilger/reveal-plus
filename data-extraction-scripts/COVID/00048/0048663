Here, we examined the role of cholesterol for both viral envelope and target cell membrane for bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) infection. Cholesterol depletion by pretreatment of Madin–Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells with a cholesterol-sequestering drug methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), inhibited the production of BoHV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was partially reversed by cholesterol replenishment, indicating that the reduction was caused by cholesterol depletion. Cholesterol depletion at the post-entry stage only had a mild effect on the virus production. However, cell membrane cholesterol depletion did not reduce the virus attachment. In addition, treatment of BoHV-1 particles with MβCD also reduced the virus infectivity significantly and the effect was partially reversed by addition of exogenous cholesterol. Taken together, these data implicated that cell membrane cholesterol mainly contributed to BoHV-1 entry into MDBK cells and the viral envelope cholesterol was also essential for the virus infectivity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
