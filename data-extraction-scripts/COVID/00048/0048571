Specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the SARS-CoV are vital for early diagnosis and pathological studies of SARS. Direct intrasplenic inoculation of plasmid DNA encoding antigen is an effective and fast approach to generate specific mAb when the protein antigen is difficult to prepare or dangerous in use. In this study, we selected one fragment of SARS-CoV spike protein (S1-3) as antigenic determinant by immunoinformatics. Single intrasplenic immunization of plasmid DNA encoding S1-3 induced anti-spike protein antibodies. We established one hybridoma cell line secreting specific mAb and evaluated this mAb with murine leukemia virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike protein (MLV/SARS-CoV). The mAb could recognize the spike protein on the MLV/SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells albeit with no neutralizing effect on the infectivity of the pseudotype virus. Our results show that a single-shot intrasplenic DNA immunization is efficient for the production of specific mAb against SARS spike protein, and a linear epitope of the spike protein is recognized in this study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
