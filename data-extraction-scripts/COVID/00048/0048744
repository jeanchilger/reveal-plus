Time, temperature and quantity of each reagent were optimised for the detection of the two viruses. This method was more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting the two viruses. The RT-LAMP reaction is highly suited for disease diagnosis in developing countries. Amplification of DNA can be detected without the use of agarose gel electrophoresis, by the production of a whitish precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate as a by-product. The cost of RT-LAMP for one reaction is nearly 4 times less than that of RT-PCR.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
