This was a prospective observational study in influenza epidemics that enrolled adult outpatients who visited a hospital with respiratory tract infection symptoms. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of FilmArray respiratory panel (RP). Fifty patients were enrolled. FilmArray RP detected the pathogens in 28 patients. The common pathogens were influenza virus (n = 14), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 6), and human rhinovirus (n = 6). Of the 14 patients with influenza virus, 6 were negative for the antigen test. The physicians diagnosed and treated the patients without the result of FilmArray in this study. Of the patients with positive FilmArray RP, 9 were treated with antibiotics; however, bacteria were detected in only 3 patients. By implementing FilmArray RP, URTI and acute bronchitis would be precisely diagnosed, and inappropriate use of antibiotics can be reduced.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
