The possibility of rapid testing has been facilitated by development of cartridge-based random access molecular technologies that are now widely available. Whether the expense of cartridge-based assays is justified in terms of clinical or laboratory cost savings is controversial. This prospective study evaluated the impact of the Biofire FilmArray Respiratory Panel (‘FilmArray’), a cartridge-based random access molecular test, compared with standard batched molecular testing using an ‘in-house’ respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on laboratory and health service outcomes for adult patients at a tertiary-level adult hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Laboratory result turnaround time was significantly reduced with the FilmArray (median 4.4 h) compared to a standard validated in-house respiratory PCR assay (median 21.6 h, p < 0.0001) and there was a significant increase in diagnostic yield with the Filmarray (71/124, 57.3%) compared to in-house PCR (79/200; 39.5%; p = 0.002). Despite improved result turnaround time and increased diagnostic yield from testing, there was no corresponding reduction in hospital length of stay or use of isolation beds. Although cartridge-based molecular testing reduced turnaround time to result for respiratory pathogen testing, it did not impact on health service outcomes such as hospital length of stay. Further work is warranted to determine whether cartridge-based tests at the point of care can improve clinical and health service impacts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
