Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain JHM, antigen was in the form of formalin-fixed, infected 17 C1 1 cells. This antigen detected antibody to the homologous strain of MHV as well as to two heterologous MHV strains and a serologically related rat coronavirus, sialodacryodenititis virus. Antibody titers in assays using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated or ureiase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were substantially higher than in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The ureiase assay was somewhat more sensitive than the HRP assay. MHV-JHM antigen was stable under a variety of storage conditions for at least two months.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
