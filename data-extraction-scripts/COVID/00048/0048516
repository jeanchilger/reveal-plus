The fascinating and unparalleled properties of electrospun nanomaterials, such as large surface-to-volume ratios and high open porosity, have opened new and unexpected fields of application, especially in ultrasensitive sensors. By exploiting the inherent physical, electrical and mechanical properties of nanomaterials, it is possible to improve the performance of conventional sensors by increasing their sensitivity, selectivity, portability and power efficiency. In this chapter, the recent progress in the development of electrospun nanomaterials is reviewed. In particular, applications in some predominant sensing approaches, such as acoustic wave, resistive, photoelectric, optical and biological, are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
