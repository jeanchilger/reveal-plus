Most of the detergents used in this study solubilized G in a 4 S monomeric form. However, when CHAPS was used, G had a sedimentation coefficient of 9 S. This high sedimentation coefficient allowed its further separation from M1 and M2. Using electron microscopy of negatively stained samples, we studied the morphology of G on virus and after detergent extraction. End-on views of G on virus clearly showed triangles consisting of three dots indicating the trimeric nature of native G. End-on views of CHAPS-isolated G showed very similar triangles confirming that, using this detergent, G was solubilized in its native trimeric structure. Electron microscopy also showed that G had a “head” and a “stalk” and provided the basis for a low-resolution model of the glycoprotein structure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
