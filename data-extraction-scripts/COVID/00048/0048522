In this study, we demonstrated that cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 plays an important role in JEV replication. The knockdown of DDX5 was able to decrease JEV replication, and overexpression of DDX5 mutants lacking the helicase activity also reduced JEV replication, suggesting the helicase activity is essential for JEV replication. DDX5 knockdown did not affect virus assembly and release. GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that DDX5 could interact with JEV core protein, non-structural protein 3 (NS3) and 5 (NS5-MTase and NS5-RdRp domains). Meanwhile, we also confirmed that DDX5 interacts with these viral proteins during JEV infection. Confocal microscopy analysis showed that endogenous DDX5 is recruited to the cytoplasm and colocalizes with these viral proteins and viral RNA. RNA-pulldown experiment showed that DDX5 only binds to the JEV 3′ untranslated region (UTR). Finally, we confirmed the role of DDX5 in JEV RNA replication using JEV-replicon system. In conclusion, we identified DDX5 as a positive regulator for JEV replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
