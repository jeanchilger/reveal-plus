However, the lack of a safe and highly efficient adjuvant (immune stimulant) is regarded as the biggest obstacle to vaccine development. The incorporation of a peptide antigen in a nanostructure-based delivery system was recently shown to overcome this obstacle. Nanostructures are often formed from antigens conjugated to molecules such as polymers, lipids, and peptide, with the help of self-assembly phenomenon. This review describes the application of self-assembly process for the production of peptide-based vaccine candidates and the ability of these nanostructures to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
