While the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRD) exist as monomers and bind individual carbohydrates with low affinity and are permissive in nature, the full-length receptors form tetramers through their repeat domain and recognize specific ligands with high affinity. To understand the tetramer-based ligand binding avidity, we determined the crystal structure of DC-SIGNR with its last repeat region. Compared to the carbohydrate-bound CRD structure, the structure revealed conformational changes in the calcium and carbohydrate coordination loops of CRD, an additional disulfide bond between the N and the C termini of the CRD, and a helical conformation for the last repeat. On the basis of the current crystal structure and other published structures with sequence homology to the repeat domain, we generated a tetramer model for DC-SIGN/R using homology modeling and propose a ligand-recognition index to identify potential receptor ligands.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
