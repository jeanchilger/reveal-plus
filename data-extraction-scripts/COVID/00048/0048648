Over the last several years, reports have begun to elucidate aspects of the molecular biology of the causal virus (FIPV). These papers complement a rapidly growing base of knowledge concerning the molecular organization and replication of coronaviruses in general. The fascinating immunopathogenesis of FIPV infection and the virus' interaction with macrophages has also been the subject of several recent papers. It is now clear that FIPV may be of interest to scientists other than veterinary virologists since its pathogenesis may provide a useful model system for other viruses whose infectivity is enhanced in the presence of virus-specific antibody. With these advances and the recent release of the first commercially-available FIPV vaccine, it is appropriate to review what is known about the organization and replication of coronaviruses and the pathogenesis of FIPV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
