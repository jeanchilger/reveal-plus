Based on the study of construction status and environmental risk of high-level biosafety laboratories and on the study of the layout structure and bio risk measures of biosafety laboratory contaminants, this paper analyzed the key point of environmental risk, and proposed the risk management system of high-level biosafety laboratories. System framework and realization process is given in the paper in order to provide reference for domestic construction of high-level biosafety laboratories and the improvement of risk emergency system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
