Since its discovery in the early 1990s, tremendous progresses have been made in understanding the molecular biology and pathogenesis of PRRSV. Although modified live-attenuated vaccines (MLVs) and inactivated vaccines against PRRSV have been available for more than a decade, the disease remains difficult to control. The efficacies of these vaccines especially against heterologous strains remain questionable: the MLVs were generally effective against homologous strains but variable in success against heterologous strains, and the outcomes of inactivated vaccines in the field are not very promising. With the development of PRRSV reverse genetics systems and the acquisition of new understanding on anti-PRRSV immunity, rational design of the next generation of PRRSV vaccines can now be explored. In this review, we discussed the recent advances in anti-PRRSV immunity and vaccinology, the recent progresses in PRRSV vaccine development particularly the reverse genetics system-based vaccine development, and provided a perspective on potential novel strategies and approaches that may be applicable to the development of the next generation of PRRSV vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
