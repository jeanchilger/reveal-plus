<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-05-13</DATELINE><TITLE>Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism and generalised toxoplasmosis in a cat with neurological signs</TITLE><BODY>A 12-year-old female neutered cat presented with acute onset unilateral vestibular syndrome, a spontaneous cutaneous wound, polyuria, polydipsia, and diabetes mellitus. Hyperadrenocorticism was demonstrated by means of hyper-responsiveness to adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation, elevated urine cortisol-to-creatinine ratio, bilaterally enlarged adrenal glands on abdominal ultrasound, and pituitary enlargement on computed tomography imaging. The cat was euthanased and post-mortem histological examination revealed feline skin fragility syndrome; confirmed a pituitary cromophobe macroadenoma; and generalised toxoplasmosis with tachyzoites in the pancreas, bowel and brain. This report is the first to describe the concurrence of macroadenoma pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism and generalised toxoplasmosis in a cat with central vestibular syndrome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
