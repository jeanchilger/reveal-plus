The test combines classical cell culture with a quantitative real-time PCR read-out. The assay for Lassa virus was validated with ribavirin, which showed an IC50 of 9μg/ml. Small-scale screening identified a class of imidazole nucleoside/nucleotide analogues with antiviral activity against Lassa virus. The analogues contained either dinitrile or diester groups at the imidazole 4,5-positions, and many of which possessed an acyclic sugar or sugar phosphonate moiety at the imidazole 1-position. The IC50 values of the most active compounds ranged from 5 to 21μg/ml. The compounds also inhibited replication of SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus in analogous assays, although to a lesser extent than Lassa virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
