The purified recombinant proteins of 350 and 366 amino acids in length, respectively, were employed to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of CCoV type I antibodies in dog sera. Four canine sera-positive for CCoV type II, four sera-positive for CCoV type I and 10 negative control sera were examined. Only the sera-positive for CCoV type I strongly reacted with both the proteins, whereas the sera-positive for CCoV type II showed low reactivity in the ELISA test. As CCoV type I seems to be not cultivable in cell cultures, the recombinant fragments of the S protein represent a unique method to study, preliminarily, the immunological and the pathogenetic characteristics of this new virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
