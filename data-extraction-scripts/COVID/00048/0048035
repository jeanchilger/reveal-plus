However, existing protocols for the refinement of glycoproteins at low resolution have failed to keep up with these advances. As a result, numerous deposited structures contain glycan stereochemical errors. Here, we describe a Rosetta-based approach for both cryoEM and X-ray crystallography refinement of glycoproteins which is capable of correcting conformational and configurational errors in carbohydrates. Building upon a previous Rosetta framework, we introduced additional features and score terms enabling automatic detection, setup and refinement of glycan-containing structures. We benchmarked this approach using twelve crystal structures and showed that glycan geometries can be automatically improved while maintaining good fit to the crystallographic data. Finally, we used this method to refine carbohydrates of the human coronavirus NL63 spike glycoprotein and of an HIV envelope glycoprotein, demonstrating its usefulness for cryoEM refinement.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
