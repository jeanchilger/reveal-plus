<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-08-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Application of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry in Clinical Virology</TITLE><BODY>Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a diagnostic tool of microbial identification and characterization based on the detection of the mass of molecules. In the majority of clinical laboratories, this technology is currently being used mainly for bacterial diagnosis, but several approaches in the field of virology have been investigated. The introduction of this technology in clinical virology will improve the diagnosis of infections produced by viruses but also the discovery of mutations and variants of these microorganisms as well as the detection of antiviral resistance. This chapter is focused on the main current applications of MALDI-TOF MS techniques in clinical virology showing the state of the art with respect to this exciting new technology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
