In China, sporadic HAdV-B14 infections were first identified in 2010, in Guangzhou and Beijing. In 2012, an outbreak of FRI occurred in Beijing and the etiological agent was determined to be HAdV-B14. We present a complete HAdV-B14 genome sequence isolated from this recent FRI outbreak. Virus in 30 throat swab samples was detected using polymerase chain reaction assays, and confirmed by sequencing of the fiber, hexon and penton genes. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis showed that the newly isolated HAdV-B14 (HAdV-B14 CHN) shared highest sequence homology with a 2006 isolate from the United States and clustered closely with other HAdV-B14 strains. It is expected that data from the present study will help in devising better protocols for virus surveillance, and in developing preventative measures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
