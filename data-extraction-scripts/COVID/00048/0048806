In 85% of confirmed SARS cases (n = 20), the S2 recombinant fragment based WB was positive and this was comparable to the commercial ELISA using heat killed SARS-CoV. WB using the other four recombinant fragments in confirmed SARS cases generated lower rates of detection (S1—75%, S1-N—25%, S1-C—55%). Evaluation of sera from healthy controls (n = 60) resulted in two weakly positive ELISA results with the remainder being negative while the S2 protein WB demonstrated three positive results from the 20 controls with a history of SARS contact and no positive results in 40 noncontact controls. A discrepancy between the ELISA and S2 WB arose when evaluating per-2003 sera from individuals (n = 10) with SARS-like symptoms (ELISA—100% positive, S2 WB—30% positive). These data suggest that the S2 WB assay may be particularly useful in ELISA-negative SARS cases and in some ELISA-positive non-SARS cases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
