Several examples include HIV, Ebola, Lujo, and, most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. In this study, we describe a method for the swift generation of a human-derived monoclonal antibody, known as LCA60, as a treatment for MERS infections. LCA60 antibody was generated using the Cellclone Technology from the immortalized B cells of a human donor recovering from MERS. Only four months were required from the initial screening of B cells to the development of a stable CHO cell line suitable for the production of clinical grade antibody, thereby delineating a rapid pathway for the development of antiviral therapies against emerging viruses. Currently, the LCA60 antibody is being considered for clinical development, which includes prophylaxis in individuals at risk and a treatment for severe MERS-CoV infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
