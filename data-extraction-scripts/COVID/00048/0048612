The RSV assay was applied to 100 samples and the Influenza A and B assay applied to 96 samples all of which had been tested previously by an “in-house” multiplex real-time PCR assay. Forty-three samples were negative for RSV by both methods and 56 samples were positive by both methods. One sample was negative by the new RSV assay although it was positive for RSV A by the “in-house” test. Thirty-nine samples were negative for influenza virus by both methods and 55 samples were positive by both assays. Two samples were negative by the new influenza assay however they were positive by the “in-house” influenza assay. The new assays did not cross react with samples containing other viruses including parainfluenza 1, 2, and 4; human metapnuemovirus; coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43; rhinovirus; adenovirus; bocavirus and had a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98.2% for RSV and 96.5% for influenza respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that the new assays are specific and sensitive for the detection of RSV and influenza viruses in clinical samples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
