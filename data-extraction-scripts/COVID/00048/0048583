<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Pathways and control of connexin oligomerization</TITLE><BODY>Connexins form gap junction channels that link neighboring cells into an intercellular communication network. Many cells that express multiple connexins produce heteromeric channels containing at least two connexins, which provides a means to fine tune gap junctional communication. Formation of channels by multiple connexins is controlled at two levels: by inherent structural compatibilities that enable connexins to hetero-oligomerize and by cellular mechanisms that restrict the formation of heteromers by otherwise compatible connexins. Here, I discuss roles for secretory compartments beyond the endoplasmic reticulum in connexin oligomerization and evidence that suggests that membrane microdomains help regulate connexin trafficking and assembly.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
