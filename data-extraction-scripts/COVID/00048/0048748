Design & methods A total of 2787 family and non-family visitors entering through the glass sliding door of 6 pediatric wards at a university children's hospital were observed for 4 h, respectively, before and after interventions between April 27 and May 20, 2018. In the first intervention, a visual stimulus emphasized the location of the hand sanitizer. In the second intervention, an additional auditory stimulus transmitted a cue through a motion sensor speaker. Results During the preliminary observation, the HHC rates of family and non-family visitors were 0.0% and 1.5%, respectively; after the visual stimulus, they were 0.6% and 5.4%, and after the audio-visual stimulus, 1.8% and 8.2%. There was a significant increase in the overall HHC with the visual (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.76–20.90) and audio-visual (OR, 8.67; 95% CI, 3.08–33.70) stimuli (Fisher's exact test, p < .05). Conclusions The HHC of family and non-family visitors entering pediatric wards was very low and the audio-visual stimulus was found to be more effective than was the visual stimulus alone. Practice implications To reduce healthcare-associated infection, pediatric wards must actively implement effective interventions. Using audio-visual stimulation to increase HHC among visitors will provide advantages. Follow-up research should examine the current state of HHC among visitors in various locations and conditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
