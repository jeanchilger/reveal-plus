Here, the immunogenicity of a novel antigenic domain found on the carboxy-terminal of the spike protein characterized by the peptide motif GPRLQPY, was evaluated. A synthetic peptide whose linear sequence is identical to the 24a.a. carboxy-terminal portion of the spike protein (S-CT24) elicited a strong antibody response in BALB/c mice that had specific reactivity against the S-CT24 and PEDV. These antibodies were shown to have a specific affinity to the GPRLQPY motif, as demonstrated by non-reactivity with a peptide that lacks this motif. In addition, antiS-CT24 antibodies exhibited neutralizing activities against KPEDV-9 in focus reduction neutralization tests suggesting that the GPRLQPY motif induces neutralizing antibodies against PEDV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
