Eighty exacerbations in 54 patients were studied. Exacerbations associated with influenza (n=8) were compared with those associated with other nonbacterial infections (n=15) and those in which no nonbacterial infection was detected (n=57). Patients with influenza had lower Shwachman scores and were more likely to be seroposifive for C-reactive protein than patients in the other two groups. Patients with influenza had lower Shwachman scores and were more likely to be seropositive for C-reactive protein than patients in the other two groups. Patients with influenza had a mean decrease in forced expiratory volume per second of 26%, compared with test results obtained before the exacerbation. In contrast, the mean decrease in forced expiratory volume per second was 6% for other nonbacterial infections and 12% for the group without nonbacterial infection (p<0.05 for both comparisons). The forced expiratory flow in first 25% of vital capacity decreased 44% in the influenza group compared with 13% and 17% in the other two groups, respectively (p<0.01 for both comparisons). The influenza group also had a higher proportion of patients with at least a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume per second and forced expiratory flow in first 25% of vital capacity than the other two groups had (p<0.05 for all comparisons). These data suggest that influenza is associated with severe exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis and support recommendations for efforts to prevent influenza in this population.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
