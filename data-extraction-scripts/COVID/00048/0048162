We carried out an assessment on SARS patients after their recovery from their acute illness. Method Postal survey comprising Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) questionnaires and anxiety and depression measures was sent to them at 3 months' postdischarge. Results There was a significant impairment in both the HRQoL and mental functioning. Forty-one percent had scores indicative of a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); about 30% had likely anxiety and depression. Conclusion SARS has significant impact on HRQoL and psychological status at 3 months.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
