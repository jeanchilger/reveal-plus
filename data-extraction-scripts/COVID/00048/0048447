LC16m8, an attenuated, replicating smallpox vaccine derived from the Lister strain of vaccinia, is currently licensed in Japan where it was safely used in over 50,000 children in the 1970s. It has been shown to have markedly less neurotoxicity than unattenuated vaccines in nonclinical studies. LC16m8 is immunogenic after a single dose, and recent studies in two different animal models have demonstrated protective efficacy equivalent to that of the only FDA-licensed smallpox vaccine. This article reviews the history and available scientific literature regarding LC16m8 and provides comparisons to other smallpox vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
