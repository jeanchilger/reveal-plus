<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Emerging viral infections in a rapidly changing world</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Emerging viral infections in both humans and animals have been reported with increased frequency in recent years. Recent advances have been made in our knowledge of some of these, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, West Nile virus and Ebola virus. Research efforts to mitigate their effects have concentrated on improved surveillance and diagnostic capabilities, as well as on the development of vaccines and antiviral agents. More attention needs to be given to the identification of the underlying causes for the emergence of infectious diseases, which are often related to anthropogenic social and environmental changes. Addressing these factors might help to decrease the rate of emergence of infectious diseases and allow the transition to a more sustainable society.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
