<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-09-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Human Mobility and the Global Spread of Infectious Diseases: A Focus on Air Travel</TITLE><BODY>Greater human mobility, largely driven by air travel, is leading to an increase in the frequency and reach of infectious disease epidemics. Air travel can rapidly connect any two points on the planet, and this has the potential to cause swift and broad dissemination of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that may pose a threat to global health security. Investments to strengthen surveillance, build robust early-warning systems, improve predictive models, and coordinate public health responses may help to prevent, detect, and respond to new infectious disease epidemics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
