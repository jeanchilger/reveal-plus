In most programmes the screening and evaluation start using inhibition of virus multiplication in cell cultures, but in some instances the screening starts in animal models of different viral diseases. In these cases, the mechanism of action has to be analyzed after the in vivo effect has been found. It is not possible to specify precisely the time and resources required in a newly started project to find a compound active against a virus infection but 5-10 years is a reasonable estimation. For some viruses such as herpesviruses, where a number of active inhibitors are already known, the task is simpler than it is to find inhibitors of a virus such as influenza against which only a few active inhibitors have been reported. Evaluation of clinical efficacy in humans is a large and difficult part of the development of an antiviral drug. The number of uncontrolled clinical studies claiming efficacy of different drugs against viral diseases is depressingly large. It is essential to perform double-blind, placebo-controlled and statistically well evaluated studies to be able to judge the clinical efficacy of an antiviral drug. As the knowledge of the detailed natural history and molecular biology of viral diseases and viruses themselves increases, one will obviously have better opportunities to find new drugs. Methods such as X-ray diffraction measurement and NMR determinations will probably lead to a detailed understanding of the structures and interactions taking place at the active site of viral enzymes and their cellular counterparts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
