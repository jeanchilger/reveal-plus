In this study, we constructed a recombinant porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (vP129/swIL1β) expressing swine IL-1β from the separate subgenomic mRNA inserted between the ORF1b and ORF2 genome region. MARC-145 cells infected with vP129/swIL1β secreted 1947pg of IL-1β per 2×105 cells at 36h post-infection. In vitro growth kinetics analysis in MARC-145 cells showed that the vP129/swIL1β virus had a similar replication rate as that of parental virus. We further performed in vivo characterization of the vP129/swIL1β virus in a nursery pig disease model. The vP129/swIL1β infected pigs did not show visible clinical signs, while respiratory distress and lethargy were evident in pigs infected with the parental virus. The expression of various cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells measured by fluorescent microsphere immunoassay showed that IL-1β, IL-4 and IFN-γ expression levels were up-regulated in pigs infected with vP129/swIL1β at 7 and 14 days post-infection. However, no detectable level of IL-1β was found in serum samples from pigs infected with either vP129/swIL1β or parental virus. In summary, this study demonstrated a recombinant PRRSV as a useful tool to study the role of different cytokines in disease progression and immune responses, which represents a new strategy for future therapeutic application and vaccine development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
