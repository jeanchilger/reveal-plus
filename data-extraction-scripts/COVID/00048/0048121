Simultaneous and automated detection of multiple influenza HA are of great importance for early-stage diagnosis and operator protection. Herein, a magnetism and size mediated microfluidic platform was developed for point-of-care detection of multiple influenza HA. With multiplex microvalves and computer program control, the detection process showed high automation which had a great potential for avoiding the high-risk virus exposure to the operator. Taking advantage of magnetism and size mediated multiple physical fields, multiple influenza HA could be simultaneous separation and detection depended on different-size magnetic beads. Using high-luminance quantum dots as reporter, this assay achieved high sensitivity with a detection limit of 3.4 ng/mL for H7N9 HA and 4.5 ng/mL for H9N2 HA, and showed excellent specificity, anti-interference ability and good reproducibility. These results indicate that this method may propose new avenues for early detection of multiple influenza subtypes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
