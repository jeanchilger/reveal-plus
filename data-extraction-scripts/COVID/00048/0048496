Although several vaccines against these viruses are commercially available there is room for improvement, especially in the case of PRRSV. The ability of arteriviruses to counteract the immune response is thought to decrease the efficacy of the current modified live virus vaccines. We have recently shown that the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of EAV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) is important for the inhibition of innate immune activation during infection. A vaccine virus lacking PLP2 DUB activity may therefore be more immunogenic and provide improved protection against subsequent challenge than its DUB-competent counterpart. To test this hypothesis, twenty Shetland mares were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Two groups were vaccinated, either with DUB-positive (n =9) or DUB-negative (n =9) recombinant EAV. The third group (n =2) was not vaccinated. All horses were subsequently challenged with the virulent KY84 strain of EAV. Both vaccine viruses proved to be replication competent in vivo. In addition, the DUB-negative virus provided a similar degree of protection against clinical disease as its DUB-positive parental counterpart. Owing to the already high level of protection provided by the parental virus, a possible improvement due to inactivation of PLP2 DUB activity could not be detected under these experimental conditions. Taken together, the data obtained in this study warrant further in vivo investigations into the potential of using DUB-mutant viruses for the improvement of arterivirus vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
