However, the frequency of sympatric divergence in these organisms will depend on the definition of sympatry that one uses. Like many of our current species concepts, the typical definition of sympatry is not widely applicable to parasites. Revisiting the historically defined conditions for sympatric speciation and considering the situations in which we might regard parasites as being sympatric leads us to question the classic prediction that parasites have a greater tendency to speciate in sympatry than do free-living organisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
