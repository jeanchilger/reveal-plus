<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Emerging Infectious Diseases</TITLE><BODY>Emerging infectious diseases (EID) and reemerging infectious diseases are increasing globally. Zoonotic diseases are transmitted from animals to humans through direct contact or through food, water, and the environment. Vector-borne diseases are major sources of mortality and morbidity globally. Three mosquito-borne viruses are yellow fever, chikungunya virus, and dengue virus. Recent EIDs include Candida auris, Elizabethkingia anopheles, The Lone Star tick, and avian influenza H7N2. In addition, mcr-1 may contribute to the dissemination of drug resistance to gram-negative bacteria. Nurses play a major role in the identification and prevention of EID within health care settings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
