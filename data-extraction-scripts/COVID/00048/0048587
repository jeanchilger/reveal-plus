<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-05-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Respiratory Infections</TITLE><BODY>Acute respiratory illnesses are the most frequently occurring illness in all age groups globally. Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Children and elderly people are at increased risk, especially in developing countries. The most important etiologic agents of severe lower respiratory illness are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Efficacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the influenza virus. Viruses are much more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults. Clinical syndromes overlap considerably, and there is increasing evidence of bacterial-viral co-infections and of bacterial pneumonia being secondary to viral respiratory tract infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
