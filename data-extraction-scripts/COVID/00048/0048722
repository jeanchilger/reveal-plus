The remainder of the protein in each replacer was from milk sources. Milk and milk replacers (13% solids) were fed at 10% of body weight daily. No dry feed or bedding was provided. Absorptive ability of small intestine was evaluated by xylose absorption test at 2-wk intervals. With calves under general anesthesia, a biopsy of small intestine was taken after each xylose test to examine morphological changes in mucosa by scanning electron microscopy. Villi were long, tapering, and uniform in calves fed milk. Calves fed casein had greater variation in size and conformation of villi. Gradual deterioration in villous integrity was seen in calves fed soy proteins. Calves fed fish protein concentrate performed poorly and had abnormal villi. Diets were changed to milk to test for reversal of effects after marked alterations in intestinal structure had been observed. Atrophy was reversed as villi returned toward normal size and shape within 2 wk after milk feeding began. The surgical procedure apparently did not cause harmful effects of villi. Absorption of xylose and daily gain were greater, and feces firmer, in calves fed milk than in those fed milk replacers.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
