Among many possible applications of the PRRSV infectious cDNA clones, development of genetically modified vaccines is of particular interest. Using infectious clones, the PRRSV genome has been manipulated by changing individual amino acids, deleting coding regions, inserting foreign sequences, and generating arterivirus chimeras. The limited available data suggest that all structural proteins of PRRSV are essential for replication of the virus, and that PRRSV infectivity is relatively intolerant of subtle changes within the structural proteins. The major tasks in PRRSV research are to identify virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms, and to understand the structure–function relationships of individual viral proteins. Utilizing these infectious clones as tools, a new generation of safe and efficacious PRRS vaccines may be constructed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
