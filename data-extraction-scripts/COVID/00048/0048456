We first find the Laplace transform M 2 L s , a and then obtain M 2 t , a asymptotically by inversion. Further, we have derived the asymptotic expressions of M 2 t , a for some special lifetime distributions such as exponential, gamma, Weibull, lognormal and truncated normal. Finally, the asymptotic solution is compared with the numerical solution to evaluate its performance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
