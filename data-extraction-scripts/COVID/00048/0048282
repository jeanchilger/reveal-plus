Most, if not all, biological activities of antibodies, however, depend on the functional properties of cells that express receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies (FcR). Most FcR are activating receptors; some are inhibitory. When engaged by antibodies and antigen, the various FcR expressed by a given cell trigger a mixture of positive and negative signals whose integration determines cellular responses. Responses of cell populations can be either protective or pathogenic. As a consequence, FcR are potential target/tools in a variety of diseases including infection, allergy, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
