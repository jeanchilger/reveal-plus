The high case fatality rate, growing geographic distribution and vaguely defined epidemiology of MERS-CoV have created an urgent need for effective public health countermeasures, paramount of which is an effective means of prevention through a vaccine or antibody prophylaxis. Despite the relatively few number of cases to-date, research and development of MERS-CoV vaccine candidates is advancing quickly. This review surveys the landscape of these efforts across multiple groups in academia, government and industry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
