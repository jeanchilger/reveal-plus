Coupled with the emerging biological and pathological significance of carbohydrates, lectins have become extensively used as research tools in glycobiology. However, lectin-based drug development has been impeded by high manufacturing costs, low chemical stability, and the potential risk of initiating an unfavorable immune response. As alternatives to lectins, non-protein small molecules having carbohydrate-binding properties (lectin mimics) are currently attracting a great deal of attention because of their ease of preparation and chemical modification. Lectin mimics of synthetic origin are divided roughly into two groups, boronic acid-dependent and boronic acid-independent lectin mimics. This article outlines their representative architectures and carbohydrate-binding properties, and discusses their therapeutic potential by reviewing recent attempts to develop antiviral and antimicrobial agents using their architectures. We also focus on the naturally occurring lectin mimics, pradimicins and benanomicins. They are the only class of non-protein natural products having a C-type lectin-like ability to recognize d-mannopyranosides in the presence of Ca(2 +) ions. Their molecular basis of carbohydrate recognition and therapeutic potential are also discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
