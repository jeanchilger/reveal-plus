One ELISA, in which CCV-infected CRFK cell lysate is used as antigen, is for the detection and titration of antibody against CCV, and the other ELISA uses the double antibody sandwich method for the detection of CCV antigen. The first ELISA procedure demonstrated antibody responses in dogs inoculated with CCV, as did the virus neutralization test; the second ELISA detected specific CCV antigen in feces and organ homogenates of inoculated dogs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
