Iodinated protein A isolated from Staphylococcus aureus detects an influx of IgG into the central nervous system of mice inoculated with the coronavirus SD. Antispecies antibody that has been iodinated detects coronavirus antigen expression for 24 days post-inoculation while it is only detectable for 10 days by immunofluorescence. A direct comparison of indirect fluorescence and autoradiographic methods indicates that the autoradiographic techniques are considerably more sensitive. This increased sensitivity is sufficient to permit the detection of viral antigen in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
