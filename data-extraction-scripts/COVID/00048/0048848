Rapid advances in genetic engineering and synthetic biology have revolutionized the development of highly lethal and reliable biological agents with enhanced virulence, survivability, and drug resistance. In the current scenario, construction and misuse of next generation synthetic agents is not mere science fiction, but has become a harsh reality. Next generation bioweapons are potential bio-threats to peace, security, and well-being of the targeted country. Thus, effective diagnostic and prophylactic measures need to be developed to mitigate adverse effects caused by the hazardous biological agents. This chapter provides a systematic overview of emergence and synthesis of next generation agents, methods, and challenges associated with detection, protection, and decontamination of the concerned biological agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
