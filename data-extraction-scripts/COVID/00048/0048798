<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-09-04</DATELINE><TITLE>Cell-Based Strategies to Reconstitute Lung Function in Infants with Severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</TITLE><BODY>Recent advances in our understanding of stem/progenitor cells and their potential to repair damaged organs offer the possibility of cell-based treatments for neonatal lung injury. This review summarizes basic concepts of stem/progenitor cell biology and discusses the recent advances and challenges of cell-based therapies for lung diseases, with a particular focus on bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that primarily affects very preterm infants. Despite advances in perinatal care, BPD still remains the most common complication of extreme prematurity, and there is no specific treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
