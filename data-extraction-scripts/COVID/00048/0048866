DNA fragments encoded by the gag and pol region were expressed in two rodent cell lines, LTK- and BHK. Both stably transfected cell lines continuously produce recombinant proteins which react with HIV-specific antisera. The GAG precursor and a 39-kDa proteolytic fragment thereof were the major recombinant proteins detected. Expression of the gag-pol region leads to the production of the GAG-POL precursor. Ribosomal frameshifting at the HIV-1 shifty sequence to a typical extent could be positively demonstrated by an enzyme assay. Despite the presence of the viral protease within the GAG-POL precursors, proteolytic processing of the HIV-derived polyproteins was extremely inefficient. The efficiency could not be enhanced by overexpression of the HIV-1 protease encoding region.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
