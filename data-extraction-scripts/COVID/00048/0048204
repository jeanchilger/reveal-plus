<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-04-02</DATELINE><TITLE>The Cellular and Physiological Basis for Lung Repair and Regeneration: Past, Present, and Future</TITLE><BODY>The respiratory system, which includes the trachea, airways, and distal alveoli, is a complex multi-cellular organ that intimately links with the cardiovascular system to accomplish gas exchange. In this review and as members of the NIH/NHLBI-supported Progenitor Cell Translational Consortium, we discuss key aspects of lung repair and regeneration. We focus on the cellular compositions within functional niches, cell-cell signaling in homeostatic health, the responses to injury, and new methods to study lung repair and regeneration. We also provide future directions for an improved understanding of the cell biology of the respiratory system, as well as new therapeutic avenues.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
