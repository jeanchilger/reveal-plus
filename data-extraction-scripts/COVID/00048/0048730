To find out the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed the transcription profile stimulated by IFN-α and IFN-γ in Huh-7 cells and found that the transcription of a subset of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) including BclG, XAF1, TRAIL and TAP1 was enhanced when IFN-α and γ were both present. Promoter analysis of BclG revealed that IRF-1 and STAT1 were both required in this process. Enhanced IRF-1/DNA complex formation was observed in interferon co-treatment group by gel shift analysis. Furthermore, IRF-1 activation was found to be generally required in this cluster of ISGs. STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation was elevated by IFN combination treatment, however, only the hyper-transactivation of GAS but not ISRE was observed. In conclusion, hyper-activation of IRF-1 and elevated STAT1 dimer formation may be two general switches which contribute to a much more robust antiviral symphony against virus replication when type I and type II IFNs are co-administered.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
