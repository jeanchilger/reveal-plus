<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-03-24</DATELINE><TITLE>APIC State-of-the-art Report: The role of the infection preventionist in emergency management</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: This report summarizes the scope and role of infection preventionists in emergency management for all types of disasters. Preventing the transmission of infectious agents during a disaster is an essential component of emergency management. Previous disasters have illustrated the need for better infection prevention and the involvement of an infection prevention professional in planning for and responding to such events. METHODS: An evidence-based approach was used, consisting of a literature review and review by members of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc, Emergency Preparedness Committee. RESULTS: Nine domains were identified that describe the role of the infection preventionist in emergency management: knowledge of disasters and emergency management, assessing readiness and emergency management plans, infection prevention coverage, participation in disaster response and recovery, health care policy development, surveillance, patient management, physical plant issues, and infection preventionist as educator. Details for each domain are provided. CONCLUSION: Infection preventionists need to become more involved in emergency management at the personal, facility, and community level. This report outlines the infection preventionist's responsibilities related to emergency management.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
