<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-08-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Respiratory infections of the human bocavirus</TITLE><BODY>The human bocavirus is one of the most common respiratory viruses and occurs in all age groups. It is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and causes clinical symptoms from the mild common cold to life threatening respiratory diseases. Besides its ability to persist the virus appears to trigger chronic lung disease and increase the clinical symptoms, while being a putative trigger for fibrotic lung diseases. Laboratory diagnostics should include serological diagnostics in order to rule out a viremia because due to prolonged viral shedding acute and chronic infections cannot be differentiated on the detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory specimen alone. Although Koch’s postulates cannot be formally fulfilled due to the lack of an animal model and the chance for clinical trials with volunteers are limited due to the long term effects of HBoV infections, there is no doubt that the virus is a serious pathogen and requires attention. The aim of the chapter is to present an overview of our current knowledge on respiratory infections with the human bocavirus, and to provide basic and essential information on clinical features, molecular diagnostics, and epidemiologic challenges arising with this pathogen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
