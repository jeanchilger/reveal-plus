Emphasis is placed on the importance of infection control to gastrointestinal endoscopy. Recommendations that minimize the risk of nosocomial infection during the preparation, handling, and administration of intravenous medications, particularly propofol, are provided. These recommendations include the labeling of predrawn syringes; use of sterile single-use syringes, needles, and administration sets for each patient; and, whenever feasible, administration of intravenous medications promptly after opening their prefilled syringes or after opening their ampoules or vials and filling the sterile syringes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
