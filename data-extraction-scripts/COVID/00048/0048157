<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-04-13</DATELINE><TITLE>Omics Approaches in Viral Biotechnology: Toward Understanding the Viral Diseases, Prevention, Therapy, and Other Applications in Human Betterment</TITLE><BODY>Biotechnology deals with the manipulation of genetic material to achieve the desired outputs. Viruses have been popular agents used in biotechnological research and applications. Viruses are compact entities that have the ability to carry the genetic material to the cell and thus facilitate the safe transport and integration of genetic material to the target cell. Therefore viruses are used in various biotechnology applications such as production of vaccines, production of therapeutic proteins, and improvement of crops with the help of plant viruses and also in cancer research. Omics approach takes into account the development and usage of viral biotechnology applications for processes like genome profiling, call-based screening, and vaccine development. These efforts aim at providing high-quality health care for human betterment. Overall, viruses are potent agents of research and applications of biotechnology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
