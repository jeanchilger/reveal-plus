Several subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) encoding structural proteins are generated by template switching from the body transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) to the leader TRS. The process preferentially generates shorter sgmRNA. Appropriate readthrough of body TRSs is required to produce longer sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA. We find that phosphorylation of the viral nucleocapsid (N) by host glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is required for template switching. GSK-3 inhibition selectively reduces the generation of gRNA and longer sgmRNAs, but not shorter sgmRNAs. N phosphorylation allows recruitment of the RNA helicase DDX1 to the phosphorylated-N-containing complex, which facilitates template readthrough and enables longer sgmRNA synthesis. DDX1 knockdown or loss of helicase activity markedly reduces the levels of longer sgmRNAs. Thus, coronaviruses employ a unique strategy for the transition from discontinuous to continuous transcription to ensure balanced sgmRNAs and full-length gRNA synthesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
