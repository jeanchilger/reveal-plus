Maturation of the SCV has been shown to occur by selective interactions with the endocytic pathway. We show here that after invasion of epithelial cells and migration to a perinuclear location, the majority of SCVs become surrounded by membranes of the Golgi network. This process is dependent on the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 type III secretion system effector SseG. In infected cells, SseG was associated with the SCV and peripheral punctate structures. Only bacterial cells closely associated with the Golgi network were able to multiply; furthermore, mutation of sseG or disruption of the Golgi network inhibited intracellular bacterial growth. When expressed in epithelial cells, SseG co-localized extensively with markers of the trans-Golgi network. We identify a Golgi-targeting domain within SseG, and other regions of the protein that are required for localization of bacteria to the Golgi network. Therefore, replication of Salmonella in epithelial cells is dependent on simultaneous and selective interactions with both endocytic and secretory pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
