<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-02-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Large-scale purification and crystallization of the endoribonuclease XendoU: troubleshooting with His-tagged proteins</TITLE><BODY>XendoU is the first endoribonuclease described in higher eukaryotes as being involved in the endonucleolytic processing of intron-encoded small nucleolar RNAs. It is conserved among eukaryotes and its viral homologue is essential in SARS replication and transcription. The large-scale purification and crystallization of recombinant XendoU are reported. The tendency of the recombinant enzyme to aggregate could be reversed upon the addition of chelating agents (EDTA, imidazole): aggregation is a potential drawback when purifying and crystallizing His-tagged proteins, which are widely used, especially in high-throughput structural studies. Purified monodisperse XendoU crystallized in two different space groups: trigonal P3(1)21, diffracting to low resolution, and monoclinic C2, diffracting to higher resolution.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
