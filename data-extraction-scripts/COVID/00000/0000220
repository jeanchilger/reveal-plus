<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-06-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Targeted Delivery of siRNA</TITLE><BODY>Therapeutic application of siRNA requires delivery to the correct intracellular location, to interact with the RNAi machinery within the target cell, within the target tissue responsible for the pathology. Each of these levels of targeting poses a significant barrier. To overcome these barriers several strategies have been developed, such as chemical modifications of siRNA, viral nucleic acid delivery systems, and nonviral nucleic acid delivery systems. Here, we discuss progress that has been made to improve targeted delivery of siRNA in vivo for each of these strategies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
