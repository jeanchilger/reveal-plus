In both complexes, all six monosaccharide-binding sites of GRFT were occupied and the mode of binding was similar to that of mannose. In our previous attempts to obtain a complex with N-acetylglucosamine by soaking, only a single site was occupied; thus, cocrystallization was clearly superior despite lower concentration of the ligand. Isothermal titration calorimetric experiments with N-acetylglucosamine, glucose, and mannose provided enthalpic evidence of distinct binding differences between the three monosaccharides. A comparison of the mode of binding of different monosaccharides is discussed in the context of the antiviral activity of GRFT, based on specific binding to high-mannose-containing complex carbohydrates found on viral envelopes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
