The transmembrane molecule CD13 is expressed on monocytes and endothelial cells and has been shown to mediate homotypic cell adhesion, which may imply a role for CD13 in inflammatory monocyte trafficking. Here, we show that ligation and clustering of CD13 by mAb or viral ligands potently induce myeloid cell/endothelial adhesion in a signal transduction-dependent manner involving monocytic cytoskeletal rearrangement and filopodia formation. Treatment with soluble recombinant (r)CD13 blocks this CD13-dependent adhesion, and CD13 molecules from monocytic and endothelial cells are present in the same immunocomplex, suggesting a direct participation of CD13 in the adhesive interaction. This concept is strengthened by the fact that activated monocytic cells adhere to immobilized recombinant CD13. Furthermore, treatment with anti-CD13 antibodies in a murine model of peritonitis results in a decrease in leukocyte infiltration into the peritoneum, suggesting a potential role for CD13 in leukocyte trafficking in vivo. Therefore, this work supports a new direction for CD13 biology, where these cell surface molecules act as true molecular interfaces that induce and participate in critical inflammatory cell interactions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
