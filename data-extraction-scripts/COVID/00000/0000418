We now demonstrate that SLPI binds to the membrane of human macrophages through the phospholipid-binding protein, annexin II. Based on the recent identification of human cell membrane phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer coat of HIV-1, we define a novel role for annexin II, a PS-binding moiety, as a cellular cofactor supporting macrophage HIV-1 infection. Moreover, this HIV-1 PS interaction with annexin II can be disrupted by SLPI or other annexin II–specific inhibitors. The PS–annexin II connection may represent a new target to prevent HIV-1 infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
