The prevalence of a virus-positive respiratory sample and its significance in patients requiring mechanical ventilation remain unknown. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in all consecutive adults ventilated for more than 48 hours admitted to a 22-bed medical intensive care unit during a 12-month period. Respiratory samples at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, by indirect immunofluorescence assay or by molecular methods in systematic tracheobronchial aspirates. Patients with a virus-negative respiratory sample at the time of intubation were considered unexposed and served as the control group. RESULTS: Forty-five viruses were isolated in 41/187 (22%) patients. Rhinovirus was the most commonly isolated virus (42%), followed byherpes simplex virus type 1 (22%) and virus influenza A (16%). In multivariate analysis controlling for the Acute Pathophysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, patients with respiratory disorder at admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.8–5.1; P = 0.12), with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma patients (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–6.7; P = 0.01) and with admission between 21 November and 21 March (adjusted odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–5.9; P = 0.008) were independently associated with a virus-positive sample. Among the 122 patients admitted with respiratory disorder, a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.273; 95% confidence interval, 0.096–0.777; P < 0.006) was independently associated with better survival, controlling for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and admission for cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. Among the remaining 65 patients, a virus-positive sample on intubation did not predict survival. CONCLUSION: We confirmed the pathogenic role of respiratory viruses in the intensive care unit, particularly rhinovirus. We suggest, however, that the prognostic value of virus-associated respiratory disorder is better than that of other causes of respiratory disorder.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
