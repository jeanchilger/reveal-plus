Reports on natural MHV outbreaks are rare and most studies have been conducted by deliberately infecting mice with MHV laboratory strains that cause moderate to severe disturbances to the immune system. We have investigated the effects of a natural acute outbreak of MHV in our otherwise specific-pathogen-free (SPF) inbred mouse colonies, and of enzootic chronic MHV infection on cytokine production and resistance to the intracellular pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi. We found that BALB/c and/or C57BL/6 SPF mice that had been injected with T. cruzi blood trypomastigotes from recently MHV-contaminated (MHV(+)) mice developed significantly higher parasite blood counts, accelerated death, and showed higher IL-10 production by spleen cells than their counterparts whose T. cruzi inoculum was derived from MHV-negative (MHV(−)) donors. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production by MHV(+) and MHV(−) mice was not significantly different. In contrast, T. cruzi infection of chronically MHV-infected mice did not result in major changes in the course of infection when compared with that observed in mice from MHV(−) colonies, although a trend to higher parasitaemia levels was observed in BALB/c MHV(+) mice. Nevertheless, both BALB/c and C57BL/6 T. cruzi-infected MHV(+) mice had diminished IFN-γ production to parasite-antigen stimulation in comparison with similarly infected MHV(−) mice. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) production levels by spleen cells did not differ between chronic MHV(+) and MHV(−) mice, but IFN-γ neutralization by monoclonal antibody treatment of anti-CD3-stimulated spleen cell cultures showed higher levels of IL-10 synthesis in MHV(+) BALB/c mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
