Consequently, the regulation of DC maturation should reflect these multifaceted immunological processes. In the present study, we have defined the role of particular cytokines, Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and T lymphocytes in the porcine monocyte-derived DC (MoDC). Interferon-α (IFN-α) alone was a poor inducer of MoDC maturation, but in association with tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), or TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid I:C, an up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex II and CD80/86 expression was noted, along with reduced endocytic activity. In contrast, TNF-α alone or in combination with the TLR ligands was a poor inducer of DC maturation, but co-operated with T-lymphocytes in the presence of antigen to induce DC maturation. Natural interferon producing cells (NIPC, or plasmacytoid DCs) represent a danger-recognition system of the immune defences, and can respond to viruses not otherwise recognized as posing a danger. Indeed, MoDC did not respond to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), whereas NIPC produced high levels of IFN-α and TNF-α after TGEV stimulation. Moreover, supernatants from the stimulated NIPC induced maturation in MoDCs. These matured MoDCs displayed an enhanced ability to present antigen to and thus stimulate T cells. Taken together, the present work demonstrates that maturation of MoDC not only results from TLR signalling, but can require co-operation with various cell types – principally NIPC and activated T cells – which would reflect the particular immunological situation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
