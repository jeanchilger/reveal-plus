<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-06-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Crystallization and preliminary X-ray characterization of aminopeptidase N from Escherichia coli</TITLE><BODY>A recombinant form of aminopeptidase N (molecular weight 99 kDa) from Escherichia coli was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using ammonium sulfate as a precipitating agent. The crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P3(1)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 120.5, c = 171.0 Å. The crystals are most likely to contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit, with a V (M) value of 3.62 Å(3) Da(−1). Diffraction data were collected to 2.0 Å resolution using Cu Kα radiation from a rotating-anode X-ray generator.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
