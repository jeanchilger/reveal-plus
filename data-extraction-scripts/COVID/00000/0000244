Its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity appears to be supplied by non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) that includes an RdRp domain conserved in all RNA viruses. Using SARS coronavirus, we now show that coronaviruses uniquely encode a second RdRp residing in nsp8. This protein strongly prefers the internal 5′-(G/U)CC-3′ trinucleotides on RNA templates to initiate the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides of <6 residues in a reaction whose fidelity is relatively low. Distant structural homology between the C-terminal domain of nsp8 and the catalytic palm subdomain of RdRps of RNA viruses suggests a common origin of the two coronavirus RdRps, which however may have evolved different sets of catalytic residues. A parallel between the nsp8 RdRp and cellular DNA-dependent RNA primases is drawn to propose that the nsp8 RdRp produces primers utilized by the primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
