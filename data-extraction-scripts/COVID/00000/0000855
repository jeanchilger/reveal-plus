<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-03-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Bird Migration Routes and Risk for Pathogen Dispersion into Western Mediterranean Wetlands</TITLE><BODY>Wild birds share with humans the capacity for moving fast over large distances. During migratory movements, birds carry pathogens that can be transmitted between species at breeding, wintering, and stopover places where numerous birds of various species are concentrated. We consider the area of the Camargue (southern France) as an example to highlight how ad hoc information already available on birds’ movements, abundance, and diversity can help assess the introduction and transmission risk for birdborne diseases in the western Mediterranean wetlands. Avian influenza and West Nile viruses are used as examples because birds are central to the epidemiology of these viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
