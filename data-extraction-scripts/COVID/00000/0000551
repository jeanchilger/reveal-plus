Gene targeting studies have distinguished four effector pathways of the IFN-mediated antiviral response: the Mx GTPase pathway, the 2′-5′ oligoadenylate-synthetase-directed ribonuclease L pathway, the protein kinase R pathway and the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway. These effector pathways individually block viral transcription, degrade viral RNA, inhibit translation, and modify protein function to control all steps of viral replication. Ongoing research continues to expose additional activities for the effector proteins and has revealed unanticipated functions of the antiviral response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
