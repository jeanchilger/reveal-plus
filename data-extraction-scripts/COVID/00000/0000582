All these approaches are limited in resolution and can at best distinguish a twofold (or 50%) difference in copy number. We have developed a new technology to study copy numbers using a platform known as the digital array, a nanofluidic biochip capable of accurately quantitating genes of interest in DNA samples. We have evaluated the digital array's performance using a model system, to show that this technology is exquisitely sensitive, capable of differentiating as little as a 15% difference in gene copy number (or between 6 and 7 copies of a target gene). We have also analyzed commercial DNA samples for their CYP2D6 copy numbers and confirmed that our results were consistent with those obtained independently using conventional techniques. In a screening experiment with breast cancer and normal DNA samples, the ERBB2 gene was found to be amplified in about 35% of breast cancer samples. The use of the digital array enables accurate measurement of gene copy numbers and is of significant value in CNV studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
