It has evolved various strategies to counteract the production and action of type I interferons, which mobilize the front-line defense against viral infection. In this study we demonstrate that SARS coronavirus M protein inhibits gene transcription of type I interferons. M protein potently antagonizes the activation of interferon-stimulated response element-dependent transcription by double-stranded RNA, RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, IKKϵ, and virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) but has no influence on the transcriptional activity of this element when IRF3 or IRF7 is overexpressed. M protein physically associates with RIG-I, TBK1, IKKϵ, and TRAF3 and likely sequesters some of them in membrane-associated cytoplasmic compartments. Consequently, the expression of M protein prevents the formation of TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex and thereby inhibits TBK1/IKKϵ-dependent activation of IRF3/IRF7 transcription factors. Taken together, our findings reveal a new mechanism by which SARS coronavirus circumvents the production of type I interferons.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
