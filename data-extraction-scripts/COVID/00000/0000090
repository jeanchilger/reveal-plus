The predictions include the complete set of H2(d) class I (H2-K(d), H2-L(d) and H2-D(d)) and class II (I-E(d) and I-A(d)) molecules. The prediction system utilizes quantitative matrices, which were rigorously validated using experimentally determined binders and non-binders and also by in vivo studies using viral proteins. The prediction performance of PRED(BALB/c) is of very high accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first online server for the prediction of peptides binding to a complete set of major histocompatibility complex molecules in a model organism (H2(d) haplotype). PRED(BALB/c) is available at .&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
