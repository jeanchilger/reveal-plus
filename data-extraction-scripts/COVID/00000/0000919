Carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a (CEACAM1a) is the specific receptor for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus known to induce acute viral hepatitis in mice. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms responsible for the secretion of high-pathogenic MHV3-induced inflammatory cytokines. We report that the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in peritoneal macrophages does not depend on CEACAM1a, as demonstrated in cells isolated from Ceacam1a(−/−) mice. The induction of IL-6 and TNF-α production was related rather to the fixation of the spike (S) protein of MHV3 on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in regions enriched in heparan sulphate and did not rely on viral replication, as demonstrated with denatured S protein and UV-inactivated virus. High levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were produced in livers from infected C57BL/6 mice but not in livers from Tlr2(−/−) mice. The histopathological observations were correlated with the levels of those inflammatory cytokines. Depending on mouse strain, the viral fixation to heparan sulfate/TLR2 stimulated differently the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB in the induction of IL-6 and TNF-α. These results suggest that TLR2 and heparan sulphate receptors can act as new viral PPRs involved in inflammatory responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
