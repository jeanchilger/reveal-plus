Here we describe a fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR) method developed for fast measurement of AHV-1 DNA based on TaqMan MGB technology. RESULTS: The detection limit of the assay was 1 × 10(1 )standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 2 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity, specificity, simplicity and reproducibility of the AHV-1 fluorogenic PCR assay, combined with its wide dynamic range and high throughput, make this method suitable for a broad spectrum of AHV-1 etiologically related application.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
