<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-10-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Zika virus infection or the future of infectious diseases()</TITLE><BODY>Zika virus belongs to the Flaviridae, an extended phylogenetic family containing dengue or yellow fever, viruses whose shared main vector are Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The virus originally came from Central African simian reservoirs and, from there, expanded rapidly across the Pacific to South America. The disease is an example of exantematic fever usually mild. Mortality is very low and mainly limited to secondary Guillain–Barré or foetal microcephaly cases. Diagnostic confirmation requires a RT-PCR in blood up to the 5th day from the onset or in urine up to the 10–14th day. Specific IgM are identifiable from the 5th symptomatic day. Clinically, a suspected case should comply with: (a) a journey to epidemic areas; (b) a clinically compatible appearance with fever and skin rash, and (c) a generally normal blood count/basic biochemistry. There is some evidence that causally relates Zika virus infection with foetal microcephaly. While waiting for definitive data, all pregnant women coming from Central or South America should be tested for Zika virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
