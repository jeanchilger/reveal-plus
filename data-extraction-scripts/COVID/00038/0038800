Two fractions of this polysaccharide, CPP-1 and CPP-2, were first extracted by hot-water and purified. The average molecular weight of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were approximately 3.7×105 Da and 7.8×104 Da, and their chemical structures were studied by gas chromatography (GC), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, methylation analysis. We evaluated the effects of CPP-1 and CPP-2 on the basis of phagocytosis of macrophage assay, natural killer cells cytotoxicity assay and spleen lymphocyte proliferation assay. The results showed CPP-1 and CPP-2 significantly induced phagocytic rates and phagocytic indexes by peritoneal macrophages. Moreover, these two fractions caused a significant stimulation of rat spleen cell proliferation. At 50μg/mL, CPP-2 activated NK cells more significantly than CPP-1. These findings suggest that they should be explored as a novel potential immunostimulants.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
