In this report, recombinant AIK-C measles vaccines, expressing the RSV G or F protein of subgroup A (MVAIK/RSV/G or F), were investigated as a RSV vaccine candidate. MVAIK/RSV/G or F had the original ts phenotype and expressed RSV/G or F protein. Cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against RSV subgroups A and B were detected in cotton rats immunized intramuscularly with MVAIK/RSV/F but not MVAIK/RSV/G. In cotton rats infected with RSV, RSV was recovered and lung histopathological finding was compatible with interstitial pneumonia, demonstrating thickening of alveolar walls and infiltration of mononuclear cells. When cotton rats immunized with MVAIK/RSV/F were challenged with homologous RSV subgroup A, no infectious RSV was recovered and very mild inflammation was noted without RSV antigen expression. When they were challenged with subgroup B, protective efficacy decreased. When cotton rats immunized with MVAIK/RSV/G were challenged with RSV subgroup A, low levels of infectious virus were recovered from lung. When challenged with subgroup B, no protective effects was demonstrated, demonstrating large amounts of RSV antigen in bronchial-epithelial cells. MVAIK/RSV/F is promising candidate and protective effects should be confirmed in monkey model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
