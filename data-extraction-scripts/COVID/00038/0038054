Latter is required for proper folding of cellular proteins and of proteins of several viruses. Here, we summarize present knowledge on the role of cyclophilin A during coronavirus replication. We present data on the effect of cyclophilin A single nucleotide polymorphism mutants on the replication of human CoV-229E demonstrating the requirement of proper cyclophilin A function for virus propagation. Results define cellular cyclophilin A as a host target for inhibition of coronaviruses ranging from relatively mild common cold to highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses with the perspective of disclosing non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin A analogs to broadly inactivate the coronavirus family.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
