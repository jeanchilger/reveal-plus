Herbal preparations of the plant Echinacea purpurea have immune-enhancing properties. Objective To compare the frequency of upper respiratory tract symptoms in individuals receiving E purpurea capsules and those receiving placebo to evaluate the preventive efficacy of echinacea. Methods In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 90 volunteers recruited from hospital personnel were randomly assigned to receive 3 capsules twice daily of either placebo (parsley) or E purpurea for 8 weeks during the winter months. Upper respiratory tract symptoms were reported weekly during this period. Results Fifty-eight individuals were included in the final data analysis: 28 in the echinacea group and 30 in the placebo group. Individuals in the echinacea group reported 9 sick days per person during the 8-week period, whereas the placebo group reported 14 sick days (z = −0.42; P = .67). Mild adverse effects were noted by 8% of the echinacea group and 7% of the placebo group (P = .24). Conclusion Prophylactic treatment with commercially available E purpurea capsules did not significantly alter the frequency of upper respiratory tract symptoms compared with placebo use.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
