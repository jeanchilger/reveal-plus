We report the crystal structure of the cysteine protease domain of murine cytomegalovirus M48 (M48(USP)) in a complex with a ubiquitin (Ub)-based suicide substrate. M48(USP) adopts a papain-like fold, with the active-site cysteine forming a thioether linkage to the suicide substrate. The Ub core participates in an extensive hydrophobic interaction with an exposed β hairpin loop of M48(USP). This Ub binding mode contributes to Ub specificity and is distinct from that observed in other deubiquitinating enzymes. Both the arrangement of active-site residues and the architecture of the interface with Ub lead us to classify this domain as the founding member of a previously unknown class of deubiquitinating enzymes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
