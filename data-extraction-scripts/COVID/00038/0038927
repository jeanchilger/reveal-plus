Based on estimates, the number of LASV infections ranges from 300,000 to 500,000 cases in endemic areas with a fatality rate of 1%. Development of fast and sensitive tools for the control and prevention of Lassa virus infection as well as for clinical diagnostics of Lassa fever are crucial. Here we reported development and evaluation of a one-step quantitative RT-qPCR assay for the Lassa virus detection – LASV-Fl. This assay is suitable for the detection of lineages I-IV of Lassa virus. The limit of detection of the assay ranged from 103 copies/ml to 105 copies/ml and has 96.4% diagnostic sensitivity, whereas analytical and diagnostic specificities both were 100%. Serum, whole blood and tissue are suitable for use with the assay. The assay contains all the necessary components to perform the analysis, including an armored positive control (ARC+) and an armored internal control (IC). The study was done during the mission of specialized anti-epidemic team of the Russian Federation (SAET) in the Republic of Guinea in 2015-2018. Based on sequencing data, LASV-specific assay was developed using synthetic MS2-phage-based armored RNA particles, RNA from Lassa virus strain Josiah, and further, evaluated in field conditions using samples from patients and Mastomys natalensis rodents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
