Each calf was inoculated with Coronavirus at seven days old, followed by astrovirus, Newbury agent, Parainfluenzavirus type 3 and rotavirus at intervals of two weeks. Three of the viruses were enteropathogenic (bovine Coronavirus, bovine calici-like virus and bovine rotavirus) and two were not (bovine astrovirus and Parainfluenzavirus type 3). Plasma levels of the peptide hormones enteroglucagon and neurotensin and faecal output were measured daily and xylose absorption was studied before and after each infection. A close correlation was found between a rise in plasma enteroglucagon and neurotensin and infection with enteropathogenic viruses. The three enteropathogenic viruses caused increased daily faecal output, and elevated plasma levels of enteroglucagon and neurotensin, while the non-enteropathogens did not. The calici-like virus and rotavirus but not the Coronavirus caused xylose malabsorption.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
