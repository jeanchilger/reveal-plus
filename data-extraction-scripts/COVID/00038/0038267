We have defined by deletion analysis an 86 nucleotide sequence encompassing the overlap region which is sufficient to allow frameshifting in a heterologous context. The upstream boundary of the signal consists of the sequence UUUAAAC, which is the likely site of ribosomal slippage. We show by creation of complementary nucleotide changes that the RNA downstream of this “slippery” sequence folds into a tertiary structure termed a pseudoknot, the formation of which is essential for efficient frameshifting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
