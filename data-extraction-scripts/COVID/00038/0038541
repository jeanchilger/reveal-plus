Two amino acids differed between the S proteins of these viruses; one was located in the signal sequence and the other was in the putative cleavage site. The amino acid at position 12 in the signal sequence was S in MHV-2 and C in MHV-2f. The amino acid sequence of the cleavage site of MHV-2 was HRARS, while that of MHV-2f was HRARR, showing one amino acid replacement at position 757. In DBT cells infected with MHV-2, the S protein was not cleaved, while the S protein of MHV-2f was cleaved. The S protein of MHV-2f expressed in a transient vaccinia virus expression system was cleaved and was fusogenic in contrast to the nonfusogenic activity of uncleaved MHV-2 S protein. Because the signal sequence is assumed to be removed from the mature S protein soon after synthesis, and because the S protein of MHV-2 was expressed on the cell surface in the same way as the S protein of MHV-2f, the difference in the signal sequence seemed to have had little effect on the transportation and the fusion activity of the S protein. These results showed that MHV-2 does not fuse cells due to the lack of cleavage of its S protein. This conclusion differs from studies on the activity of syncytium formation by the S proteins of fusogenic MHV-JHM and -A59 strains. Possible reasons for these differences in fusion activity are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
