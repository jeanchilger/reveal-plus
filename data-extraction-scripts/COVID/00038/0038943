For both hemiacetals oxyanion formation occurs with a pKa value of ~7 showing that chymotrypsin reduces the oxyanion pKa values by ~5.6 pKa units and stabilizes the oxyanions of both diastereoisomers by ~32kJmol−1. As pH has only a small effect on binding we conclude that oxyanion formation does not have a significant effect on binding the aldehyde inhibitor. By comparing the binding of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO with that of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-H we estimate that the aldehyde group increases binding ~100 fold. At pH7.2 the effective molarity of the active site serine hydroxy group is ~6000 which is ~7× less effective than with the corresponding glyoxal inhibitor. Using 1H-NMR we have shown that at both 4 and 25°C the histidine pKa is ~7.3 in free chymotrypsin and it is raised to ~8 when Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO is bound. We conclude that oxyanion formation only has a minor role in raising the histidine pKa and that the aldehyde hydrogen must be replaced by a larger group to raise the histidine pKa >10 and give stereospecific formation of tetrahedral intermediates. The results show that a large increase in the pKa of the active site histidine is not needed for the active site serine hydroxyl group to have an effective molarity of 6000.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
