In this work we present the characterization of the dynamic properties of the SARS-CoV S2-HR2 domain (residues 1141–1193 of S) in the prefusion and newly discovered transition states by NMR 15N relaxation studies. The dynamic properties of the different states, which are stabilized under different experimental conditions, extend the current model of viral membrane fusion and give insight into the design of structure-based antagonists of SARS-CoV in particular, as well as other enveloped viruses such as HIV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
