<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-11-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Global virus outbreaks: Interferons as 1st responders</TITLE><BODY>Outbreaks of severe virus infections with the potential to cause global pandemics are increasing. In many instances these outbreaks have been newly emerging (SARS coronavirus), re-emerging (Ebola virus, Zika virus) or zoonotic (avian influenza H5N1) virus infections. In the absence of a targeted vaccine or a pathogen-specific antiviral, broad-spectrum antivirals would function to limit virus spread. Given the direct antiviral effects of type I interferons (IFNs) in inhibiting the replication of both DNA and RNA viruses at different stages of their replicative cycles, and the effects of type I IFNs on activating immune cell populations to clear virus infections, IFNs-α/β present as ideal candidate broad-spectrum antivirals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
