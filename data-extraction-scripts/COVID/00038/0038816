We found that the volume control policy on ambulatory care decreased physician fees and increased both the number of visits and co-payments. However, it did not result in any change in the total medical expenses. A shift in ambulatory care expenditure from BNHI to patients did not improve patient satisfaction. While the patients were comfortable with the waiting line, they were not satisfied with the providers’ strategy of limiting quota of visits during a period of time.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
