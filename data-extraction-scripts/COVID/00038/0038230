Such vaccines can be either injected or delivered on animal mucosa and are usually not adjuvanted. In this study we show that live vaccines efficacy can be improved by formulation with adjuvants in a model of mucosal delivery of live infectious bronchitis vaccine in chicken. Three adjuvant technologies have been tested using intranasal and spray delivery methods to poultry. Those technologies are water in oil in water emulsion, nanoparticles and polymer adjuvants. Intranasal delivery of polymer and nanoparticles adjuvanted live vaccines improved significantly the antibody titer and protection to challenge observed compared to a commercial non-adjuvanted reference. Moreover, spray delivery of the polymer adjuvanted vaccine showed a significantly higher protection compared to the non-adjuvanted reference. Our data demonstrates that the use of MontanideTM adjuvants in the formulation of live poultry vaccines for mucosal delivery can confer to vaccinated animals a significantly improved protection against pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
