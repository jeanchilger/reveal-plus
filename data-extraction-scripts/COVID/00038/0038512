Although there is a significant variation in codon usage bias among different SARSCoV genes, codon usage bias in SARSCoV is a little slight, which is mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position. By comparing synonymous codon usage patterns in different viruses, we observed that synonymous codon usage pattern in these virus genes was virus specific and phylogenetically conserved, but it was not host specific. Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARSCoV was diverged far from all three known groups of Coronavirus. Compositional constraints could explain most of the variation of synonymous codon usage among these virus genes, while gene function is also correlated to synonymous codon usages to a certain extent. However, translational selection and gene length have no effect on the variations of synonymous codon usage in these virus genes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
