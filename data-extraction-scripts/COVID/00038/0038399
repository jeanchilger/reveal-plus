Despite extensive antiviral functions that subdue virus replication, recent studies demonstrate pathogenic and pro-viral roles for IFN-I signaling during acute and persistent virus infection. IFN-I signaling can promote morbidity and mortality through induction of aberrant inflammatory responses during acute viral infection. In contrast, IFN-I signaling during persistent viral infection supports immune suppression, lymphoid tissue disorganization and CD4 T cell dysfunction. Systematic characterization of the cellular populations and intricacies of IFN-I signaling that promote pathology or immune suppression during acute and persistent viral infections, respectively, should inform the development of treatments and modalities to control viral associated pathologies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
