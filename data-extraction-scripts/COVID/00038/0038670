In the last few decades, the number and spatial reach of new cases has increased globally and in the United States, Lyme disease is now the most commonly reported vector-borne disease. Despite this evolving public health crisis, there has been little-to-no discussion of the implications for tourism supply and demand. This paper reviews the scientific literature to identify Lyme disease risk factors and the implications for tourism management are discussed. The major contribution of this paper is a set of recommendations for tourism managers who may be tasked with mitigating the risks for visitors and employees as well as the potential impacts of Lyme disease on destination sustainability.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
