The cell culture has been serially transferred over 100 times and has retained its initial growth requirements, proliferative capacity and morphologic features. Each virus had specific growth characteristics in this cell culture although all produced a similar CPE and plaques under agar. Cross neutralization studies demonstrated a two-way relationship between TGEV and CCV and between TGEV and FIPV, whereas a one-way relationship was demonstrated between CCV and FIPV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
