These regulatory elements—located in or near gene—bind to proteins called transcription factors to initiate the transcription process. Their occurrences are influenced by the GC-content or nucleotide composition. For generating synthetic coding sequences with pre-specified amino acid sequence and desired GC-content, there exist two stochastic methods, multinomial and maximum entropy. Both methods rely on the probability of choosing the codon synonymous for usage in regard to a specific amino acid. In spite the latter exhibited unbiased manner, the produced sequences are not exactly obeying the GC-content constraint. In this paper, we present an algorithmic solution to produce coding sequences that follow exactly a primary amino acid sequence and a desired GC-content. The proposed tool, namely CodSeqGen, depends on random selection for smaller subsets to be traversed using the backtracking approach.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
