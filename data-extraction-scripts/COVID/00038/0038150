Based on the X-ray structures of SARS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) in complex with its functional receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2), we perform computational simulations of interactions between three representative RBD mutants and four host species-specific receptors. The comparisons between computational predictions and experimental evidences validate our structural bioinformatics approaches. And the predictions further indicate that some viral prototypes might utilize the rat ACE2 while rats might serve as a vector or reservoir of SARS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
