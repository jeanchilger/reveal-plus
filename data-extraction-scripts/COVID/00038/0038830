Viroporins are a growing family of viral proteins able to enhance membrane permeability, promoting virus budding. Initially, the MHV E gene was inducibly expressed in Escherichia coli cells, leading to the arrest of bacterial growth, cell lysis and permeabilization to different compounds. Thus, exit of labeled nucleotides from E. coli cells to the cytoplasm was apparent upon expression of MHV E. In addition, enhanced entry of the antibiotic hygromycin B occurred at levels comparable to those observed with the viroporin 6K from Sindbis virus. Mammalian cells are also readily permeabilized by the expression of MHV E protein. Finally, brefeldin A powerfully blocks the viroporin activity of the E protein in BHK cells, suggesting that an intact vesicular system is necessary for this coronavirus to permeabilize mammalian cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
