Here we describe the mouse virulence properties of high replication fidelity 3D polymerase variants of human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), with mutations at positions 3D-S264L, 3D-G64R or at 3D-S264L plus 3D-G64R. Mouse-adapted strains (MP-G64R, MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R) were constructed in order to compare the virulence of the 3D polymerase variants with that of mouse-adapted parental virus (MP-26M). MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R were attenuated in mice (mean survival time 7.0 and 7.5 days p.i., respectively) compared to MP-G64R and MP-26M (mean survival time 6.5 and 6.0 days p.i., respectively). MP-26M and MP-G64R infection induced early onset, severe generalised necrotising myositis, whereas MP-S264L and MP-S264L-G64R infection induced a later onset, mild and focal skeletal muscle myositis. Our findings demonstrate that only the 3D-S264L mutation attenuates HEV71 in mice, suggesting that the high replication fidelity phenotype is not essential for virulence attenuation in this model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
