Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been associated with aberrant gene expression and may lead to pathological conditions. Evidence suggests that miRNA expression profiles are altered between health and disease and as such may be considered as biomarkers of disease. Evidence is increasing that miRNAs are particularly important in lung homeostasis and development and have been demonstrated to be the involved in many pulmonary diseases such as asthma, COPD, sarcoidosis, lung cancer and other smoking related diseases. Better understanding of the function of miRNA and the mechanisms underlying their action in the lung, would help to improve current diagnosis and therapeutics strategies in pulmonary diseases. Recently, some miRNA-based drugs have been introduced as possible therapeutic agents. In this review we aim to summarize the recent findings regarding the role of miRNAs in the airways and lung and emphasise their potential therapeutic roles in pulmonary diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
