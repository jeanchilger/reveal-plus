In this paper, based on the analysis of real epidemic data and simulations, it’s found that the risk indicator of recurrent epidemic outbreaks could be determined by the ratio of the epidemic infection rate of the year to the average infected density of the former year. According to the risk indicator, the dynamic vaccination probability of each year can be designed to suppress the epidemic outbreaks. Our simulation results show that the dynamic vaccination strategy could effectively decrease the maximal and average infected density, and meanwhile increase the time intervals of epidemic outbreaks and individuals attacked by epidemic. In addition, our results indicate that to depress the influenza outbreaks, it is not necessary to keep the vaccination probability high every year; and adjusting the vaccination probability at right time could decrease the outbreak risks with lower costs. Our findings may present a theoretical guidance for the government and the public to control the recurrent epidemic outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
