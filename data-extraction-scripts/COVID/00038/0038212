Methods Four thousands and forty-eight healthy adults aged ≥18 years were randomized (1:1) to receive one dose of either the adjuvanted split virion (3.75μg hemagglutinin antigen [HA]/AS03) or non-adjuvanted (15μg HA) vaccine. Hemagglutination inhibition [HI] antibody response was evaluated before vaccination and at Days 21, 42 and 182 (Month 6). Safety of the study vaccines was evaluated during the entire study duration. Results At Day 21, both study vaccines induced HI immune responses meeting the US regulatory criteria in subjects 18–64 years (seroprotection rate [SPR]: 98.0% [97.1–98.6]; seroconversion rate [SCR]: 89.7% [88.0–91.2] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 91.4% [89.9–92.8]; SCR: 74.6% [72.3–76.9] in the non-adjuvanted group) and >64 years of age (SPR: 86.0% [82.5–89.0]; SCR: 75.3% [71.1–79.2] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 69.1% [64.6–73.3]; SCR: 56.7% [52.0–61.3] in the non-adjuvanted group). The AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induced higher HI geometric mean titers than the non-adjuvanted vaccine at all time points. At Month 6, only subjects 18–64 years of age from both vaccine groups still met the US regulatory criteria (SPR: 82.1% [80.0–84.1]; SCR: 62.3% [59.6–64.8] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 75.3% [72.9–77.5]; SCR: 53.7% [51.0–56.4] in the non-adjuvanted group). Protective efficacy was not evaluated due to low number of RT-qPCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza cases. Through Month 12, 216 serious adverse events (in 157 subjects: 84 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 73 in the non-adjuvanted group) and 12 potentially immune mediated diseases (5 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 7 in the non-adjuvanted group) were reported. Conclusion A single dose of either adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine induced protective HI antibody levels against the A/California/7/2009 strain that persisted through Month 6 in the 18–64 years population.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
