To obtain information on the receptor binding site(s) several synthetic peptides derived from Ad2 and Ad3 fiber head sequences and their antisera were tested for interference with virus attachment to HeLa and FL cells and cell adhesion to viruses. The anti-peptide sera were also evaluated in ELISA and virus neutralisation test. Ad2 (of subgroup C) and Ad3 (of subgroup B) attachment was not significantly inhibited by peptides corresponding to the amino acid residues 535–554, 555–573, 562–582 of Ad2 fiber or 210–225, 267–283, 291–306 and 300–319 of Ad3 fiber. However, microplate pre-adsorbed Ad3 fiber residues 210–225 and 267–283 could bind FL and HeLa cells, and 1 mg/ml of Ad3 fiber residues 267–283 inhibited the cell adhesion to Ad3 virus to approximately 90%. This peptide may participate in the receptor binding site of Ad3 fiber. ELISA reactive anti-peptide antibodies against the homologous peptide and virus did not significantly reduce the cell adhesion to the immobilised virus or the virus attachment to cells, but in the neutralisation assay antibodies raised to Ad2 fiber residues 555–573 and 562–582 and Ad3 fiber residues 210–225 caused neutralisation of the homologous virus at serum dilutions of 1:500 and 1:32, respectively. The corresponding peptides and one further peptide of Ad2 fiber and two of Ad3 fiber seem to contain neutralisation epitopes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
