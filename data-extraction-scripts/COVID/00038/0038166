Additionally, the protection efficacy of several commercially available masks from such aerosols was assessed in a pilot study. Methods Twenty-six subjects were debonded during aerosol sampling, by using an innovative collection system to harvest bonding dust liberated during debonding. Dark-field microscopy, gram-stain microscopy, and chemical identification were used to determine speciation of the collected aerosol from 23 subjects. Three additional subjects were used to test 3 commercial dental or protective masks to determine whether they provide effective protection from the aerosol. Results Twenty-one species of oral bacteria were identified by the new sampling technique. Two of the 3 masks that were tested offered no protection against the aerosolized bacteria. Conclusions A new and effective method for collecting airborne bacteria is presented. Some conventional dental masks offer no protection from aerosolized organisms liberated during debonding procedures. Further assessment of mask efficacy is ongoing.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
