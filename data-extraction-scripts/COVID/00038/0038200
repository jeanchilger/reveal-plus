The IgY was produced by immunizing hens with cell wall proteins of T. rubrum, extracted from eggs by PEG precipitation and then purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The cross-reactivity (CR) with other fungi, growth inhibition on T. rubrum in vitro and therapeutic effect on T. rubrum infection in BALB/C mice of the specific IgY were then evaluated. Anti- T. rubrum cell wall proteins IgY (anti-trCWP IgY) presented a certain degree of cross-reactivity with different fungi. In the in vitro and in vivo activity researches, Anti-trCWP IgY showed a significant dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect on T. rubrum in vitro and a significant dose-dependent therapeutic effect on T. rubrum infection in BALB/C mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
