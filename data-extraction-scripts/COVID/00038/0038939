We surveyed Ebola knowledge, attitudes and perceptions (KAP) among the institute's healthcare workers. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The study consisted of a self-administered paper-based anonymous questionnaire that included 24 closed-item questions and two scales of personal concern. RESULTS: Respondents were generally well informed; compared to nurses, doctors recorded a 1.9-fold higher rate of correct responses regarding Ebola transmission (P < 0.001), but both nurses and doctors correctly identified Ebola's aetiological agent. Nurses perceived higher personal (P = 0.008) and family (P < 0.001) risk than doctors. Respondents reporting high perceived risks were more likely to be less informed about Ebola (P = 0.019) and its prevention options (P = 0.033). Males were 6.7-fold more likely to volunteer than females (P = 0.001) and so were graduates of higher rather than lower education (1.5-fold more likely, P = 0.017) and doctors than nurses (1.7-fold more likely, P = 0.018). The institute ranked first among sources of information on Ebola; respondents who had received Ebola training in the institute 2 years previously were 1.2–1.3 times more likely to correctly identify transmission routes. CONCLUSIONS: We have characterised KAP on Ebola disease among Romanian healthcare workers from a tertiary care hospital in Bucharest. Nurses, specialist physicians and laboratory personnel may need more frequent retraining than residents and senior physicians.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
