A number of infectious agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. Chlamydia pneumoniae has been the most popular and well-studied of these pathogens. It is difficult to prove a causal relationship which requires the fulfillment of Koch's postulates, first developed in the late 1800s, to establish an infectious agent as the cause of a disease process. This paper reviews the evidence for and against Chlamydia pneumoniae infection as a contributing factor to atherosclerosis disease. It examines seroepidemiologic and histopathologic studies as well as animal models using Koch's postulates and then provides an analysis of current clinical trial data.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
