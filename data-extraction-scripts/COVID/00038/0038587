<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>The history of respiratory disease management</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Lung diseases have shifted from infections – tuberculosis, pneumonia – to diseases of dirty air – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and lung cancer. New diseases have emerged from industrial pollution and HIV, while better imaging has revealed others previously unrecognized. Scientific advances in microbiology, imaging and clinical measurement have improved diagnosis and allowed better targeted treatment. Advances in treatment have been dramatic, the most important being drugs (antibiotics, cortisone, β2-adrenoreceptor agonists), ventilatory support (from iron lung to nasal positive-pressure ventilation), inhaled therapy (metered dose inhalers, nebulizers) and lung surgery (resections, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, transplantation). Delivery of care has shifted from sanatoria for the rich but nothing at all for the poor, to hospitals and universal coverage. Generalists have turned into super-specialists and doctors have been joined by growing numbers of professions allied to medicine (PAMs). Management of lung disease has vastly improved but the impact of disease remains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
