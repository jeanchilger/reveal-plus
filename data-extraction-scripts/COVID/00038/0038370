<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 12 Biosecurity Programs and Assets</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Chapter 12 explores the programs and assets that have been assembled internationally, nationally, and regionally to safeguard populations from the threat of biological agents. The programs and assets can be viewed with the framework of comprehensive emergency management, which is made up of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Nations have come together and taken a stance individually to mitigate the threat. For the most part, these programs produce policy and procedures that support the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972. Responding to a biological disaster will be frustrating, confusing, and dangerous for first responders, first receivers, and public health officials. Developed countries are far better trained and equipped to deal with the release of a formulated biological agent than they were 15years ago. Specific examples of programs and assets that match up with mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery are discussed herein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
