Potent humoral immune responses were induced under the elicitation of three times of immunizations at 2-week intervals with this vaccine, combined with three types of adjuvants (Freund's adjuvant, Al(OH)(3) adjuvant and CpG adjuvant). Titers of specific IgG antibodies in three test groups all peaked in the sixth week after first vaccination, but significant differences existed in the kinetics of specific IgG antibody levels. The strong neutralizing capacity exhibited in micro-cytopathic effect neutralization tests indicated the specific antibodies are protective. Western blot assay further demonstrated the specificity of the induced serum antibodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
