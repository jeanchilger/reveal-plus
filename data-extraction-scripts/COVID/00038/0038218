<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>SARS: future research and vaccine</TITLE><BODY>Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease of the 21st century that has pandemic potential. A novel coronavirus (CoV) was identified as its aetiological agent and its genome was sequenced within months of the World Health Organisation issuing a global threat on SARS. The high morbidity and mortality of this potentially pandemic infection demands a rapid research response to develop effective antiviral treatment and vaccine. This will depend on understanding the pathogenesis and immune response to SARS CoV. Further understanding of the ecology of SARS CoV in human and animals will help prevent future cross species transmission. Likewise for the super-spreading events, clarification of the underlying reasons will be important to prevent a large scale outbreak of SARS. Lastly it is of utmost importance that international research collaboration should be strengthened to deal with SARS and any other emerging infectious disease that can seriously threaten our future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
