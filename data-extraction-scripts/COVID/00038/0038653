<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-04-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Equine Inflammatory Markers in the Twenty-First Century A Focus on Serum Amyloid A</TITLE><BODY>Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a marker of inflammation and infection in the horse that can be assessed in the field, with rapid and marked changes seen following initiation of an inflammatory stimulus. This quality of SAA also makes its clinical use challenging, because even small inflammatory conditions can cause large changes in SAA levels. Review of the current literature provides guidelines for responses of SAA to various conditions, which can be applied to specific clinical cases. The practitioner is encouraged to use SAA in conjunction with physical examination and other diagnostic modalities to guide treatment and monitor case progression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
