In this regard, a series of 1-[ω-(phenoxy)alkyl]uracil derivatives were synthesized and examined for antiviral properties. Compounds 17, 20, 24 and 28 were found to exhibit highly specific and promising inhibitory activity against HCMV replication in HEL cell cultures with EC50 values within 5.5–12μM range. Further studies should be undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of action of these compounds and the structure–activity relationship for the linker region.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
