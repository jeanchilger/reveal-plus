In this study, eight additional gC negative (gC−) mutants derived from KOS-321 were shown to vary widely in their ability to induce lethal encephalitis in female DBA/2 mice following intracerebral inoculation. This variation in virulence showed no correlation with thymidine kinase activity. One less virulent gC− strain, gC−39, was further studied to determine whether the neurovirulent phenotype could be restored by rescue of the gC gene using standard marker rescue cotransfection procedures. The resulting progeny contained 2% gC+ recombinant virions and was tested for its ability to cause encephalitis. Although this progeny had increased virulence, it was not attributable to the acquisition of the gC gene since passive immunization of mice with a pool of anti-gC monoclonal antibodies had no effect on the development of encephalitis and only gC−viruses were isolated from diseased brain tissues. In agreement with these findings, individual plaque-purified gC positive (gC+) virus recombinants were shown not to have been restored to the wild-type virus level of neurovirulence. It is concluded that gC is not a virulence determinant in this mouse model of HSV-induced encephalitis and that cotransfection procedures can induce additional mutations that affect viral pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
