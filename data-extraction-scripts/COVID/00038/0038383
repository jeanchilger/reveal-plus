The conjugates 5f and 5h with an optimum combination of electron-withdrawing halogen substituent at C-5 position of isatin ring and a propyl chain, introduced as linker, proved to be most potent and non-cytotoxic among the series with IC(50) values of 3.76 and 4.58 μM against 3D7 and W2 strains, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
