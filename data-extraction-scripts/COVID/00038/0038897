Owing to the potential of TMCA ester and amide analogues as therapeutic agents, researches on chemical syntheses and modifications have been carried out to drug-like candidates with broad range of medicinal properties such as antitumor, antiviral, CNS (central nervous system) agents, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and hematologic agents for a long time. At the same time, SAR (structure-activity relationship) studies have draw greater attention among medicinal chemists, and many of the lead compounds were derived for various disease targets. However, there is an urgent need for the medicinal chemists to further exploit the precursor in developing chemical entities with promising bioactivity and druggability. This review concisely summarizes the synthesis and biological activity for TMCA ester and amide analogues. It also comprehensively reveals the relationship of significant biological activities along with SAR studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
