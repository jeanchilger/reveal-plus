In general, the cinnamyl derivatives proved superior to the phenyloxyethyl derivatives, however 1-[2-(4-methylphenoxy)ethyl]-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (19) exhibited the highest activity (EC50 =0.27μM) thus confirming that the 3-benzyluracil fragment in the NNRTI structure can be regarded as a functional analogue of the benzophenone pharmacophore typically found in NNRTIs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
