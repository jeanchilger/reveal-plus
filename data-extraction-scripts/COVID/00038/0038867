<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-02-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Lab-on-a-Chip, Micro- and Nanoscale Immunoassay Systems, and Microarrays</TITLE><BODY>This chapter provides a comprehensive review of miniaturized immunoassays. The economic considerations and user needs are discussed. There is a comprehensive analysis of the fundamentals of miniaturization, explaining how the relative effects of forces like surface tension and gravity change as devices and fluidics are reduced in size. These effects can be harnessed to manage flow and other kinetic elements, using forces such as capillary flow. Other means of fluid actuation and movement are described. There is a review of the types of device available, including a systematic look at the key elements of an immunoassay: antibodies, capture/solid phase, calibration, and signal generation and detection, which are covered in further detail. Methods used for microfluidic flow control are described. Analytes for which microfluidic devices have been reported are listed. There is a comprehensive list of commercial microfluidic immunodiagnostic systems, with sources of further information. The final part of the chapter covers microarrays and the detection methods associated with them. This part includes tables of label-free detection methods and commercial microarray systems, The outlook for microarrays in clinical diagnosis is considered.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
