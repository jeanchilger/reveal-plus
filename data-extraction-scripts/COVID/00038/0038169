<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-02-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Virus Entry: Open Sesame</TITLE><BODY>Detailed information about the replication cycle of viruses and their interactions with host organisms is required to develop strategies to stop them. Cell biology studies, live-cell imaging, and systems biology have started to illuminate the multiple and subtly different pathways that animal viruses use to enter host cells. These insights are revolutionizing our understanding of endocytosis and the movement of vesicles within cells. In addition, such insights reveal new targets for attacking viruses before they can usurp the host-cell machinery for replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
