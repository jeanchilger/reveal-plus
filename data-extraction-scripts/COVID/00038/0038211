Molecular basis of ribavirin resistance</TITLE><BODY>Ribavirin has proven to be effective against several viruses in the clinical setting and a multitude of viruses in vitro. With up to five different proposed mechanisms of action, recent advances have begun to discern the hierarchy of antiviral effects at play depending on the virus and the host conditions under scrutiny. Studies reveal that for many viruses, antiviral mechanisms may differ depending on cell type in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses are thus required to accurately identify mechanisms to more optimally determine clinical treatments. In recent years, a growing number of ribavirin resistant and sensitive variants have been identified. These variants not only inform on the specific mechanisms by which ribavirin enfeebles the virus, but also can themselves be tools to identify new antiviral compounds.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
