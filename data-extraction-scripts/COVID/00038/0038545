Cell RHs are necessary for early and late events in retrovirus replication. The provirus is adopted by the cell-endogenous nuclear and cytoplasmic gene expression types of machinery. Whereas retroviruses engender the supportive activity of cell RHs, other RNA viruses provoke theantiviral role of this superfamily of conserved proteins. In this chapter, we contrast retrovirus reliance on host RNA helicases to support their replication cycle, with the virus-encoded helicaseactivity utilized by RNA viruses in cytoplasmic factories. Ironically, RHs are agonists to retroviruses and antagonists to other RNA viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
