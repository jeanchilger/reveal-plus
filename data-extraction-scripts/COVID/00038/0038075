<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-09-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Genetic Basis of Salmonella Enteritidis Pathogenesis in Chickens</TITLE><BODY>Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) is the predominant cause of the food-borne salmonellosis in humans, in part because this serotype has the unique ability to contaminate chicken eggs without causing discernible illness in the infected birds. Attempts to develop effective vaccines and eradicate SE from chickens are undermined by significant limitations in our current understanding of the genetic basis of pathogenesis of SE in this reservoir host. In this chapter, we summarize the infection kinetics and provide an overview of the current understanding of genetic factors underlying SE infection in the chicken host. We also discuss the important knowledge gaps that, if addressed, will improve our understanding of the complex biology of SE in young chickens and in egg laying hens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
