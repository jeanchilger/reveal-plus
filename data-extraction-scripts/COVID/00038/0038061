However, it still remains to be elucidated that mechanisms of the innate immune response in situ after immunization (a.i.). The aim of this study was to investigate the kinetics of cell migration in the skin dogs with distinct antigenic compounds of the LBSap vaccine. Our major findings indicated that saponin adjuvant alone or combined with Leishmania braziliensis antigen induced strong local acute inflammatory reaction. However, these reactions not progressed to ulcerated lesions. Overall, the cell profile found in Sap and LBSap was composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils. There was also increased production of iNOS in Sap and LBSap groups. Thus, we can conclude that dogs immunized by LBSap and the saponin adjuvant elicited a potential innate-immune activations status compatible with effective control of the resistance to infection by Leishmania and contributing to a better understanding of the innate-immunity events induced by the LBSap vaccine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
