Turkeys were vaccinated by priming with either one dose (G1-750DP) or two doses (G3-750DDP) of 750μg DNA vaccine expressing 4F/4R S fragment and boosting with one dose of 200μg 4F/4R S fragment. One dose of 100μg DNA vaccine mixed with polyethyleneimine (PEI) and sodium hyaluronate (HA) followed by one dose of 750μg DNA vaccine and one dose of 200μg 4F/4R S fragment were given to the turkeys in group G2-100DPH. After infectious challenge by TCoV, clinical signs and TCoV detected by immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay were observed in less number of turkeys in vaccination groups than that in challenge control groups. TCoV viral RNA loads measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR were lower in vaccinated turkeys than those in challenge control turkeys. The turkeys in G3-750DDP produced the highest level of TCoV S protein-specific antibody and virus neutralization (VN) titer. Comparing to the turkeys in G1-750DP, significantly less TCoV were detected by IFA in the turkeys in G2-100DPH receiving an extra dose of 100μg DNA mixed with PEI and HA. The results indicated that DNA-prime protein-boost DNA vaccination regimen targeting TCoV S fragment encompassing neutralizing epitopes induced humoral immune response and partially protected turkeys against infectious challenge by TCoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
