Initial single center experience</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Human infection with a novel coronavirus named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East in September, 2012. The aim of this study was to establish the most pathognomonic radiological sign(s) to diagnose MERS CoV. Patients and methods This is a retrospective descriptive study. All patients were subjected to serial X-ray. High resolution non-contrast CT chest was also obtained for 10 patients. The scans were reviewed for findings including consolidation, ground-glass opacities, nodules, reticular opacities and hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. Results A total of 12 patients were included in our study with prevalence of males (2:1) with ages ranging between 18 and 76years having an average age of 36±2years. The outcome of these patients was as follows: 6 were treated with average hospital stay ranging between 21 and 35days, one case died after 14days, and 5 cases were transferred to Central Governmental hospital according the local authority rules. Conclusions MERS CoV virus may have a specific pattern in chest X-ray and CT developing a single or multiple opacities progressing into a widespread multifocal bilateral patches of ground glass opacities or confluent consolidation resembling organizing pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
