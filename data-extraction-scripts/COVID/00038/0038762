<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Recent advances in lab-on-a-chip technologies for viral diagnosis</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The global risk of viral disease outbreaks emphasizes the need for rapid, accurate, and sensitive detection techniques to speed up diagnostics allowing early intervention. An emerging field of microfluidics also known as the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) or micro total analysis system includes a wide range of diagnostic devices. This review briefly covers both conventional and microfluidics-based techniques for rapid viral detection. We first describe conventional detection methods such as cell culturing, immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These methods often have limited speed, sensitivity, or specificity and are performed with typically bulky equipment. Here, we discuss some of the LOC technologies that can overcome these demerits, highlighting the latest advances in LOC devices for viral disease diagnosis. We also discuss the fabrication of LOC systems to produce devices for performing either individual steps or virus detection in samples with the sample to answer method. The complete system consists of sample preparation, and ELISA and RT-PCR for viral-antibody and nucleic acid detection, respectively. Finally, we formulate our opinions on these areas for the future development of LOC systems for viral diagnostics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
