Viruses use all known mechanisms of variation: mutation, several forms of recombination, and segment reassortment in the case of viruses with a segmented genome. These processes are intimately connected with the replicative machineries of viruses, as well as with fundamental physico-chemical properties of nucleotides when acting as template or substrate residues. Recombination has been viewed as a means to rescue viable genomes from unfit parents, or to produce large modifications for the exploration of phenotypic novelty. All types of genetic variation can act conjointly as blind processes to provide the raw materials for adaptation to the changing environments in which viruses must replicate.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
