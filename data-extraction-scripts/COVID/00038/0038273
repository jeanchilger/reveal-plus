Their adjuvant activities were evaluated ex vivo for investigation of the synergism of the S(28–39) peptide, which is an MHC class I binding epitope of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for both humans and mice. Several compounds without the carbohydrate moiety exerted better adjuvanticity than the MDP-C that has been reported by our laboratory previously. A primary screening test revealed that compounds 6, 14 and 16 exhibited stronger adjuvanticity compared with other MDP mimics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
