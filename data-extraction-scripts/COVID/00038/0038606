The aim of this study was to characterize the subset(s) of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) expanding during active celiac disease to provide insights into the mechanisms involved in their expansion. Methods: Flow-cytometric analysis of isolated IELs and/or immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections were performed in 51 celiac patients and 50 controls with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against T-cell and natural killer (NK) receptors. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to identify candidate stimuli for NK receptor expression. Results: In normal intestine, different proportions of IELs, which were mainly T cells, expressed the NK receptors CD94/NKG2, NKR-P1A, KIR2D/3D, NKp46, Pen5, or CD56. During the active phase of celiac disease, the frequency of CD94+ IELs, which were mostly αβ T cells, was conspicuously increased over controls. In contrast, the expression of other NK markers was not modified. Furthermore, expression of CD94 could be selectively induced in vitro by T-cell receptor activation and/or interleukin 15, a cytokine produced by intestinal epithelial cells. Conclusions: The gut epithelium favors the development of T cells that express NK receptors. In active celiac disease, there is a specific and selective increase of IELs expressing CD94, the HLA-E–specific NK receptor that may be related to T-cell receptor activation and/or interleukin 15 secretion.
