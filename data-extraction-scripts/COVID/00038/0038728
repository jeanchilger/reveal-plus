This chapter reviews the current knowledge about RNA rearrangement and recombination in viruses, and cites evidence for various mechanisms catalyzing these events. RNA recombination can occur in a spontaneous manner, and such a potential, even at low frequency, would expand opportunities for RNA conjunction. The chapter also outlines the significance of work on viroid-like pathogens, circular RNA replication, and their potential relation to early RNA; and relates the early emergence of RNA mosaics to developments leading to today's DNA-based systems of viral gene expression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
