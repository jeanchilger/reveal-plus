Recent work has shown that either virus-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells are able to mediate demyelination and also that the antibody response is crucial for clearing infectious virus. Another exciting advance is the development of recombinant coronaviruses, which, for the first time, will allow genetic manipulation of the entire viral genome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
