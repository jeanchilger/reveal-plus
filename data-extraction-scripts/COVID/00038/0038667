In this study we focussed on NK cell and interferon (IFN) responses after infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Based on surface expression of CD107+, enhanced activation of lung NK cells was observed at 1dpi, whereas in blood prolonged NK-cell activation was found. IFN-α and IFN-β mRNA and proteins were not rapidly induced whereas IFN-γ production in lung, measured by Elispot assay, increased over time at 2 and 4dpi. In contrast, IFN-γ production in blood was highest at 1dpi and decreased over time down to levels comparable to uninfected birds at 4dpi. Collectively, infection with IBV-M41 resulted in activation of NK cells in the lung and blood and rapid production of IFN-γ and not IFN-α and IFN-β compared to uninfected birds.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
