<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-10-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Involvement of the Plant Nucleolus in Virus and Viroid Infections: Parallels with Animal Pathosystems</TITLE><BODY>The nucleolus is a dynamic subnuclear body with roles in ribosome subunit biogenesis, mediation of cell-stress responses, and regulation of cell growth. An increasing number of reports reveal that similar to the proteins of animal viruses, many plant virus proteins localize in the nucleolus to divert host nucleolar proteins from their natural functions in order to exert novel role(s) in the virus infection cycle. This chapter will highlight studies showing how plant viruses recruit nucleolar functions to facilitate virus translation and replication, virus movement and assembly of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles, and to counteract plant host defense responses. Plant viruses also provide a valuable tool to gain new insights into novel nucleolar functions and processes. Investigating the interactions between plant viruses and the nucleolus will facilitate the design of novel strategies to control plant virus infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
