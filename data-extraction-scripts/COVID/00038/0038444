<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-07-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Emerging Ferret Diseases</TITLE><BODY>Abstract There are a number of newly described and emerging disease syndromes affecting the domestic ferret, and the purpose of this article is to make veterinarians aware of these diseases. A recently described systemic coronavirus infection appears to be a variant of the ferret enteric coronavirus and is currently termed “ferret infectious peritonitis.” Disseminated immunopathologic myositis, aplastic anemia/bone marrow aplasia, acute hemorrhagic syndrome, and oral ulcerations are also described, although the exact etiologies for these diseases have yet to be determined. There appears to be at least 2 important amino acid metabolism deficiencies in ferrets: hindlimb weakness in older ferrets (L-carnitine) and cysteine urolithiasis. Ferrets have recently been found to be susceptible to H1N1 influenza, so knowledge regarding this zoonotic disease is essential for veterinarians working with these animals. A novel Mycoplasma spp. has also recently been identified in ferrets with chronic respiratory problems that originated from one breeding colony. Because these diseases are still being investigated, practitioners who treat a ferret patient exhibiting clinical signs consistent with any of the conditions mentioned are encouraged to contact people who are knowledgeable of that particular illness.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
