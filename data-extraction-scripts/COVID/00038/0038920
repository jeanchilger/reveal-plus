Great progress in the mining of novel biomarkers from this diagnostic treasure trove for disease diagnosis and health monitoring has been achieved based on serum samples from healthy individuals and patients and powerful new approaches in biochemistry and systems biology. However, cumulative evidence indicates that many potential LMW protein biomarkers might still have escaped from detection due to their low abundance, the dynamic complexity of serum/plasma, and the limited efficiency of characterization approaches. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge with respect to strategies for the characterization of low-abundant LMW proteins (small intact or truncated proteins) from human serum/plasma, involving prefractionation or enrichment methods to reduce dynamic range and mass spectrometry-based characterization of low-abundant LMW proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
