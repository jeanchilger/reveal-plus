In the present paper we are reporting an expedient, one-pot, two-steps synthesis of allyl phosphonoamidates and diamidates that offers a time saving strategy when compared to literature methods. The use of these substrates in the cross metathesis reactions with alkenyl functionalised thymine and uracil nucleobases is reported. ANPs prodrugs synthesized via this methodology were evaluated for their antiviral activities against DNA and RNA viruses. It is anticipated that the use of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-napthyl as aryloxy moiety is capable to confer antiviral activity among a series of otherwise inactive uracil ProTides.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
