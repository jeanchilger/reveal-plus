Objective To evaluate the performance of a rapid antigenic test for all hMPV genotypes. Study design Frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates from 93 individuals with ARTI were analyzed for the presence of hMPV antigens using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA, Biotrin Ltd.). Results The hMPV EIA showed a sensitivity of 81%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 77% compared to viral culture and RT-PCR. Conclusion The Biotrin hMPV EIA is a convenient alternative to cell culture for detection of hMPV with an excellent specificity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
