<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-10-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Design, Synthesis and Antiviral Efficacy of a Series of Potent Chloropyridyl Ester-derived SARS-CoV 3CLpro Inhibitors</TITLE><BODY>Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of 5-chloropyridine ester-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors is described. Position of the carboxylate functionality is critical to potency. Inhibitor 10 with a 5-chloropyridinyl ester at position 4 of the indole ring is the most potent inhibitor with a SARS 3Clpro IC(50) value of 30 nM and antiviral EC(50) value of 6.9 μM. Molecular Docking studies have provided possible binding modes of these inhibitors. [Image: see text]&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
