A variety of infectious agents are implicated in calf diarrhea and co-infection of multiple pathogens is not uncommon in diarrheic calves. A case–control study was conducted to assess infectious etiologies associated with calf diarrhea in Midwest cattle farms. A total of 199 and 245 fecal samples were obtained from diarrheic and healthy calves, respectively, from 165 cattle farms. Samples were tested by a panel of multiplex PCR assays for 11 enteric pathogens: bovine rotavirus group A (BRV-A), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine enterovirus (BEV), bovine norovirus (BNoV), Nebovirus, bovine torovirus (BToV) Salmonella spp. (Salmonella), Escherichia coli (E. coli) K99+, Clostridium perfringens with β toxin gene and Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum). The association between diarrhea and detection of each pathogen was analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. More than a half of the fecal samples from the diarrheic calves had multiple pathogens. Statistically, BRV-A, BCoV, BNoV, Nebovirus, Salmonella, E. coli K99+, and C. parvum were significantly associated with calf diarrhea (p <0.05). Among them, C. parvum and BRV-A were considered to be the most common enteric pathogens for calf diarrhea with high detection frequency (33.7% and 27.1%) and strong odds ratio (173 and 79.9). Unexpectedly BNoV (OR=2.0) and Nebovirus (OR=16.7) were identified with high frequency in diarrheic calves, suggesting these viruses may have a significant contribution to calf diarrhea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
