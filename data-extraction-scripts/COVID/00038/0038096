This paper examines air flow path and airborne pollutant distribution by computational fluid dynamics modeling and field measurement. In hospitals, the risk of virus diffusion mainly depends on air flow behavior and changes in direction caused by supply air and exhaust air locations. An improved isolation room ventilation strategy has been suggested, and is found to be the most efficient in removing contaminants based on the observations and simulation results from three ventilation systems. The results show that ventilation systems utilizing the “low-level extraction” technique are very effective at removing pollutants in the human breathing zone. A new clean isolation room ventilation strategy has been developed that employs two exhaust air grilles on the wall behind the bed at low floor level, coupled with a fan filter unit, and is found to have the highest pollutant removal efficiency.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
