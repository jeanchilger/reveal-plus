<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-11-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Preparation of an intensive care unit in France for the reception of a confirmed case of Ebola virus infection()</TITLE><BODY>The current Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa is a major challenge for the worldwide medical community. On April 29th 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared 26,277 infected cases; among them, 10,884 have deceased. The epidemic is still ongoing, particularly in Sierra Leone. It is now clear that northern countries will be implicated in the care of EVD patients, both in the field and back at home. Because of the severity of EVD, a fair amount of patients may require intensive care. It is highly probable that intensive care would be able to significantly reduce the mortality linked with EVD. The preparation of a modern Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to treat an EVD patient in good conditions requires time and specific equipment. The cornerstone of this preparation includes two main goals: treating the patient and protecting healthcare providers. Staff training is time consuming and must be performed far in advance of patient arrival. To be efficient, preparation should be planned at a national level with help from public authorities, as was the case in France during the summer of 2014. Due to the severity of the disease, the high risk of transmission and scarce knowledge on EVD treatment, our propositions are necessarily original and innovative. Our review includes four topics: a brief report on the actual outbreak, where to receive and hospitalize the patients, the specific organization of the ICU and finally ethical aspects.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
