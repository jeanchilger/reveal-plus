<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-09-13</DATELINE><TITLE>Inactivation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus using heated water</TITLE><BODY>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a very contagious swine pathogen that spreads easily via the fecal-oral route, notably from contaminated fomites. The present study investigated heated water as a method for rapid thermal inactivation of PEDV. Cell-culture adapted PEDV was treated with water at varying temperatures and viral titers were measured at multiple time points post-treatment. Viable PEDV was not recovered after a ten second or longer treatment with water heated to ≥76 °C; however, PEDV nucleic acid was detected in all samples regardless of treatment. Hot water decontamination could be considered in settings where chemical disinfection is impractical.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
