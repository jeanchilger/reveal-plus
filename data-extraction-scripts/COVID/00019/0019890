Production of monoclonal RF in vitro is essential for studies of the antigenic specificities of RF, as well as for a dissection of the mechanisms of aberrant RF(+) B cell activation. We have expanded upon previous methods to develop a flow cytometry-based method to efficiently clone monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from humans with expansions of RF-like, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH) 1-69 gene segment-containing B cells. The cloned variable regions are expressed as IgM and produced during culture at concentrations between 5–20 μg/ml. Using this system, we show that clonal Igs from patients with HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia, when expressed as IgM, have RF activity. We anticipate that this system will be useful for the cloning and expression of mAbs partially encoded by VH1-69 and for determination of the reactivity patterns of polyspecific, low-affinity IgMs of human pathogenic importance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
