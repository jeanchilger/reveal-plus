In terms of the human experience, progress in treating this final common pathway, a terminal event of many human malignancies has been relatively slow. The current thinking is that primary prevention is best served by early detection of cancer and eradication of early stage cancers by screening. Some cancers spread early in their course and the role of screening may be limited. Until relatively recently there has not been a pathfinder model that makes the evasion of this unfortunate event a reality. This review discusses such an animal model and attempts to relate it to human disease in terms of intervention. Concrete proposals are also offered on how scientists may be able to intervene to prevent this deadly progression of the cancer process.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
