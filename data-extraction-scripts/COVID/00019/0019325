Genetic studies indicate that the efficiency with which reovirus strains induce apoptosis is determined by the viral S1 gene, which encodes attachment protein ς1. However, the biochemical properties of ς1 that influence apoptosis induction are unknown. To determine whether the capacity of ς1 to bind cell surface sialic acid determines the magnitude of the apoptotic response, we used isogenic reovirus mutants that differ in the capacity to engage sialic acid. We found that T3SA+, a virus capable of binding sialic acid, induces high levels of apoptosis in both HeLa cells and L cells. In contrast, non-sialic-acid-binding strain T3SA− induces little or no apoptosis in these cell types. Differences in the capacity of T3SA− and T3SA+ to induce apoptosis are not due to differences in viral protein synthesis or production of viral progeny. Removal of cell surface sialic acid with neuraminidase abolishes the capacity of T3SA+ to induce apoptosis. Similarly, incubation of T3SA+ with sialyllactose, a trisaccharide comprised of lactose and sialic acid, blocks apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that reovirus binding to cell surface sialic acid is a critical requirement for the efficient induction of apoptosis and suggest that virus receptor utilization plays an important role in regulating cell death.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
