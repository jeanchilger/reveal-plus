The asymptomatic coexistence with viruses is thought to be connected to the unique immune system of bats. MHC class I (MHC I) presentation is closely related to cytotoxic lymphocyte immunity, which plays an important role in viral resistance. To investigate the characteristics of MHC I presentation in bats, the crystal structures of peptide–MHC I complexes of Pteropus alecto, Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1 (DFANTFLP) and Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-2 (DYINTNLVP), and two related mutants, Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1(PΩL) (DFANTFLL) and Ptal-N*01:01(ΔMDL)/HEV-1, were determined. Through structural analysis, we found that Ptal-N*01:01 had a multi-Ala–assembled pocket B and a flexible hydrophobic pocket F, which could accommodate variable anchor residues and allow Ptal-N*01:01 to bind numerous peptides. Three sequential amino acids, Met, Asp, and Leu, absent from the α1 domain of the H chain in other mammals, were present in this domain in the bat. Upon deleting these amino acids and determining the structure in p/Ptal-N*01:01(ΔMDL)/HEV-1, we found they helped form an extra salt-bridge chain between the H chain and the N-terminal aspartic acid of the peptide. By introducing an MHC I random peptide library for de novo liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we found that this insertion module, present in all types of bats, can promote MHC I presentation of peptides with high affinity during the peptide exchange process. This study will help us better understand how bat MHC I presents high-affinity peptides from an extensive binding peptidome and provides a foundation to understand the cellular immunity of bats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
