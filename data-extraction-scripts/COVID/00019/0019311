<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-10-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Genetic Variants and Susceptibility to Neurological Complications Following West Nile Virus Infection</TITLE><BODY>To determine genetic factors predisposing to neurological complications following West Nile virus infection, we analyzed a cohort of 560 neuroinvasive case patients and 950 control patients for 13 371 mostly nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The top 3 SNPs on the basis of statistical significance were also in genes of biological plausibility: rs2066786 in RFC1 (replication factor C1) (P = 1.88 × 10(−5); odds ratio [OR], 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .56–.81]); rs2298771 in SCN1A (sodium channel, neuronal type I α subunit) (P = 5.87 × 10(−5); OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.21–1.77]); and rs25651 in ANPEP (ananyl aminopeptidase) (P = 1.44 × 10(−4); OR, 0.69 [95% CI, .56–.83]). Additional genotyping of these SNPs in a separate sample of 264 case patients and 296 control patients resulted in a lack of significance in the replication cohort; joint significance was as follows: rs2066786, P = .0022; rs2298771, P = .005; rs25651, P = .042. Using mostly nonsynonymous variants, we therefore did not identify genetic variants associated with neuroinvasive disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
