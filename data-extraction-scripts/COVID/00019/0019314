Its homologs are also encoded in other closely related group 2a coronaviruses and more distantly related toroviruses. Together, these proteins comprise a subset of a large superfamily of 2H phosphoesterase proteins that are distinguished by a pair of conserved His-x-Thr/Ser motifs encompassing catalytically important residues. We have used a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system to produce recombinant viruses encoding ns2 proteins with single-amino-acid substitutions in, or adjacent to, these conserved motifs, namely, inf-ns2 H46A, inf-ns2 S48A, inf-ns2-S120A, and inf-ns2-H126R. All of the mutant viruses replicate in mouse 17 clone 1 fibroblast cells and mouse embryonic cells to the same extent as the parental wild-type recombinant virus, inf-MHV-A59. However, compared to inf-MHV-A59, the inf-ns2 H46A and inf-ns2-H126R mutants are highly attenuated for replication in mouse liver following intrahepatic inoculation. Interestingly, none of the mutant viruses were attenuated for replication in mouse brain following intracranial inoculation. These results show that the ns2 protein of MHV-A59 has an important role in virus pathogenicity and that a substitution of the histidine residues of the MHV-A59 ns2 His-x-Thr/Ser motifs is critical for virus virulence in the liver but not in the brain. This novel phenotype suggests a strategy to investigate the function of the MHV-A59 ns2 protein involving the search for organ-specific proteins or RNAs that react differentially to wild-type and mutant ns2 proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
