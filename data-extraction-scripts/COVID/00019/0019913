<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-08-20</DATELINE><TITLE>So Many Roads: the Multifaceted Regulation of Autophagy Induction</TITLE><BODY>Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved, degradative process from single-cell eukaryotes, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to higher mammals, such as humans. The regulation of autophagy has been elucidated through the combined study of yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, mice, Drosophila melanogaster, and humans. MTOR, the major negative regulator of autophagy, and activating nutrient kinases, such as 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), interact with the autophagy regulatory complex: ULK1/2, RB1CC1, ATG13, and ATG101. The ULK1/2 complex induces autophagy by phosphorylating downstream autophagy complexes, such as the BECN1 PIK3 signaling complex that leads to the creation of LC3(+) autophagosomes. We highlight in this review various reports of autophagy induction that are independent of these regulators. We discuss reports of MTOR-independent, AMPK-independent, ULK1/2-independent, and BECN1-PIK3C3-independent autophagy. We illustrate that autophagy induction and the components required vary by the nature of the induction signal and type of cell and do not always require canonical members of the autophagy signaling pathway. We illustrate that rather than thinking of autophagy as a linear pathway, it is better to think of autophagy induction as an interconnecting web of key regulators, many of which can induce autophagy through different requirements depending on the type and length of induction signals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
