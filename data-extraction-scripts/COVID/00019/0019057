Since July 2003, a number of SARS cases have occurred in China, raising the possibility of future epidemics. We describe here a rapid, sensitive, and highly efficient assay for the detection of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cultured material and a small number (n = 7) of clinical samples. Using rolling circle amplification (RCA), we were able to achieve sensitive detection levels of SARS-CoV RNA in both solid and liquid phases. The main advantage of RCA is that it can be performed under isothermal conditions with minimal reagents and avoids the generation of false-positive results, a problem that is frequently encountered in PCR-based assays. Furthermore, the RCA technology provides a faster, more sensitive, and economical option to currently available PCR-based methods.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
