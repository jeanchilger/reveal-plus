Despite global efforts to eradicate orthomyxoviral pathogens, these infections remain pervasive. One such orthomyxovirus, infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV), spreads easily throughout farmed and wild salmonids, constituting a significant economic burden. ISAV entry requires the interplay of the virion-attached hemagglutinin-esterase and fusion glycoproteins. Preventing infections will rely on improved understanding of ISAV entry. Here, we present the crystal structures of ISAV hemagglutinin-esterase unbound and complexed with receptor. Several distinctive features observed in ISAV HE are not seen in any other viral glycoprotein. The structures reveal a unique mode of receptor binding that is dependent on the oligomeric assembly of hemagglutinin-esterase. Importantly, ISAV hemagglutinin-esterase receptor engagement does not initiate conformational rearrangements, suggesting a distinct viral entry mechanism. This work improves our understanding of ISAV pathogenesis and expands our knowledge on the overall diversity of viral glycoprotein-mediated entry mechanisms. Finally, it provides an atomic-resolution model of the primary neutralizing antigen critical for vaccine development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
