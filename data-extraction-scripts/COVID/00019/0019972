RNase L protects from pathogens and regulates cell growth and differentiation by destabilizing largely unknown mammalian RNA targets. We developed an approach for transcriptome-wide profiling of RNase L activity in human cells and identified hundreds of direct RNA targets and nontargets. We show that this RNase L-dependent decay selectively affects transcripts regulated by microRNA (miR)-17/miR-29/miR-200 and other miRs that function as suppressors of mammalian cell adhesion and proliferation. RNase L mimics the effects of these miRs and acts as a suppressor of proliferation and adhesion in mammalian cells. Our data suggest that RNase L-dependent decay serves to establish an antiproliferative state via destabilization of the miR-regulated transcriptome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
