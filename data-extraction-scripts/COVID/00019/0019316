All 15 hemagglutinin subtypes replicated in pheasants, and most subtypes transmitted to naïve contact pheasants, primarily via the fecal-oral route. Many viruses were shed from the gastrointestinal tract of experimentally inoculated pheasants for 14 days or longer. Virus was isolated from the cloacal swabs of one contact pheasant for an unprecedented 45 days. Chukar partridges were less susceptible to infection with avian influenza viruses. The viruses that replicated in chukar partridges were isolated for 7 days after experimental inoculation, predominantly from the respiratory tract. We detected high neutralizing antibody titers with correspondingly low levels of serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers in pheasants and chukar partridges when chicken red blood cells were used in serological analyses. When horse erythrocytes were used, antibody titers were comparable to those obtained by using the neutralization assay. More importantly, the results suggested that pheasants can serve as a reservoir of influenza virus. Because of their continuous asymptomatic infection and longer stay in the markets, pheasants are ideal “carriers” of influenza A viruses. Their continued presence in live markets contributes to the perpetuation and genetic interaction of influenza viruses there. On the basis of our findings, it does not make good sense to ban quail but not pheasants from the live markets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
