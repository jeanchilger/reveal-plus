The process of demyelination is largely immune-mediated, as immunodeficient mice (RAG1(−/−) mice) do not develop demyelination upon infection; however, demyelination develops if these mice are reconstituted with either JHMV-immune CD4 or CD8 T cells. Since myelin destruction is a consequence of the inflammatory response associated with virus clearance, we reasoned that decreasing the amount of inflammation would diminish clinical disease and demyelination. Given that regulatory T cells (Tregs) have potent anti-inflammatory effects, we adoptively transferred Tregs into infected C57BL/6 and RAG1(−/−) mice. In both instances, transfer of Tregs decreased weight loss, clinical scores and demyelination. Transferred Tregs were not detected in the CNS of infected RAG1(−/−) mice, but rather appeared to mediate their effects in the draining cervical lymph nodes. We show that Tregs dampen the inflammatory response mediated by transferred JHMV-immune splenocytes in infected RAG1(−/−) mice by decreasing T cell proliferation, dendritic cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production, without inducing apoptosis. By extension, decreasing inflammation, whether by Treg transfer or by otherwise enhancing the anti-inflammatory milieu, could contribute to improved clinical outcomes in patients with virus-induced demyelination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
