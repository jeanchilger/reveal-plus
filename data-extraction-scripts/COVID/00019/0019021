Dendritic cells (DCs) are key cells in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and infection of these cells could potentially contribute to a dysregulated immune response; consistent with this, recent results suggest that DCs are readily infected by another strain of mouse hepatitis virus, the A59 strain (MHV-A59). Herein, we show that the JHM strain also productively infected DCs. Moreover, mature DCs were at least 10 times more susceptible than immature DCs to infection with MHV-JHM. DC function was impaired after MHV-JHM infection, resulting in decreased stimulation of CD8 T cells in vitro. Preferential infection of mature DCs was not due to differential expression of the MHV-JHM receptor CEACAM-1a on mature or immature cells or to differences in apoptosis. Although we could not detect infected DCs in vivo, both CD8(+) and CD11b(+) splenic DCs were susceptible to infection with MHV-JHM directly ex vivo. This preferential infection of mature DCs may inhibit the development of an efficient immune response to the virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
