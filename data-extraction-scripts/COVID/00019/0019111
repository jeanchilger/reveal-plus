The active Caspase-6 is localized in neuritic plaques, in neuropil threads, and in neurofibrillary tangles containing neurons that are not morphologically apoptotic in nature. To investigate the potential consequences of the activation of Caspase-6 in neurons, we conducted a proteomics analysis of Caspase-6-mediated cleavage of human neuronal proteins. Proteins from the cytosolic and membrane subcellular compartments were treated with recombinant active Caspase-6 and compared with undigested proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. LC/MS/MS analyses of the proteins that were cleaved identified 24 different potential protein substrates. Of these, 40% were cytoskeleton or cytoskeleton-associated proteins. We focused on the cytoskeleton proteins because these are critical for neuronal structure and function. Caspase-6 cleavage of α-Tubulin, α-Actinin-4, Spinophilin, and Drebrin was confirmed. At least one Caspase-6 cleavage site was identified for Drebrin, Spinophilin, and α-Tubulin. A neoepitope antiserum to α-Tubulin cleaved by Caspase-6 immunostained neurons, neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and neuritic plaques in Alzheimer disease and co-localized with active Caspase-6. These results imply that the early and neuritic activation of Caspase-6 in Alzheimer disease could disrupt the cytoskeleton network of neurons, resulting in impaired neuronal structure and function in the absence of cell death. This study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
