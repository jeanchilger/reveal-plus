However, the exact mechanisms of injury to the central nervous system (CNS) during flavivirus infections remain poorly understood. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS and are important for multiple functions, including control of viral pathogenesis. Utilizing a pharmacologic method of microglia depletion (PLX5622 [Plexxikon Inc.], an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor), we sought to determine the role of microglia in flaviviral pathogenesis. Depletion of microglia resulted in increased mortality and viral titer in the brain following infection with either West Nile virus (WNV) or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Interestingly, microglial depletion did not prevent virus-induced increases in the expression of relevant cytokines and chemokines at the mRNA level. In fact, the expression of several proinflammatory genes was increased in virus-infected, microglia-depleted mice compared to virus-infected, untreated controls. In contrast, and as expected, expression of the macrophage marker triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) was decreased in virus-infected, PLX5622-treated mice compared to virus-infected controls. IMPORTANCE As CNS invasion by flaviviruses is a rare but life-threatening event, it is critical to understand how brain-resident immune cells elicit protection or injury during disease progression. Microglia have been shown to be important in viral clearance but may also contribute to CNS injury as part of the neuroinflammatory process. By utilizing a microglial depletion model, we can begin to parse out the exact roles of microglia during flaviviral pathogenesis with hopes of understanding specific mechanisms as potential targets for therapeutics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
