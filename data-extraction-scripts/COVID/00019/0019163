We previously developed targeting lentiviral vectors by pseudotyping with modified Sindbis virus envelope proteins. These modified Sindbis virus envelope proteins have mutations in their original receptor-binding regions to eliminate their natural tropisms, and they are conjugated with targeting proteins, including antibodies and peptides, to confer their tropisms on target cells. We investigated whether our targeting vectors interact with DC-SIGN, which traps many types of viruses and gene therapy vectors by binding to the N-glycans of their envelope proteins. We found that these vectors do not interact with DC-SIGN. When these vectors were produced in the presence of deoxymannojirimycin, which alters the structures of N-glycans from complex to high mannose, these vectors used DC-SIGN as their receptor. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the N-glycans at E2 amino acid (aa) 196 and E1 aa 139 mediate binding to DC-SIGN, which supports the results of a previous report of cryoelectron microscopy analysis. In addition, we investigated whether modification of the N-glycan structures could activate serum complement activity, possibly by the lectin pathway of complement activation. DC-SIGN-targeted transduction occurs in the presence of human serum complement, demonstrating that high-mannose structure N-glycans of the envelope proteins do not activate human serum complement. These results indicate that the strategy of redirecting viral vectors according to alterations of their N-glycan structures would enable the vectors to target specific cells types expressing particular types of lectins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
