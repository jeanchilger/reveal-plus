Ever since the first systematic effort by Lancefield to group Streptococcus species by M protein variants, the detection and characterization of Streptococcus by different methods have been an evolving process. The ideal assay for GAS identification not only would provide quick and accurate diagnostic results but also would reveal antibiotic resistance patterns and genotype information, aiding not only in treatment but in epidemiologic assessment as well. The oligonucleotide microarray is a promising new technology which could potentially address this need. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of oligonucleotide resequencing microarrays for identifying GAS and its associated antibiotic resistance markers. We demonstrated an assay platform that combines the use of resequencing DNA microarrays with either random nucleic acid amplification or multiplex PCR for GAS detection. When detecting Streptococcus pyogenes from coded clinical samples, this approach demonstrated an excellent concordance with a more established culture method. To this end, we showed the potential of resequencing microarrays for efficient and accurate detection of GAS and its associated antibiotic resistance markers with the benefit of sequencing information from microarray analysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
