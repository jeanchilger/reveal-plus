<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-11-03</DATELINE><TITLE>The Impact of Mass Spectrometry–Based Proteomics on Fundamental Discoveries in Virology</TITLE><BODY>In recent years, mass spectrometry has emerged as a core component of fundamental discoveries in virology. As a consequence of their coevolution, viruses and host cells have established complex, dynamic interactions that function either in promoting virus replication and dissemination or in host defense against invading pathogens. Thus, viral infection triggers an impressive range of proteome changes. Alterations in protein abundances, interactions, posttranslational modifications, subcellular localizations, and secretion are temporally regulated during the progression of an infection. Consequently, understanding viral infection at the molecular level requires versatile approaches that afford both breadth and depth of analysis. Mass spectrometry is uniquely positioned to bridge this experimental dichotomy. Its application to both unbiased systems analyses and targeted, hypothesis-driven studies has accelerated discoveries in viral pathogenesis and host defense. Here, we review the contributions of mass spectrometry–based proteomic approaches to understanding viral morphogenesis, replication, and assembly and to characterizing host responses to infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
