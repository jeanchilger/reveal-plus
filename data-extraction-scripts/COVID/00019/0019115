<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-10-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Baculovirus expression: old dog, new tricks</TITLE><BODY>Since its inception more than 30 years ago, the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has been used prolifically to produce heterologous proteins for research and development. In the cell, a cornerstone of biological activity are multiprotein complexes, catalyzing essential functions. BEVS has been uniquely successful to unlock such complex assemblies for high-resolution structural and functional analysis. Synthetic biology approaches have been implemented to optimize multigene assembly methods, accelerating upstream processes. Specialized baculoviral genomes are being created with functions tailored to enhance production of particular target protein classes. Here we comment on current and emerging developments in the field and their potential to accelerate protein complex research.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
