In these enveloped viruses, the filamentous nucleocapsid is formed by the association of nucleocapsid (N) protein with single-stranded viral RNA. The N protein is a highly immunogenic phosphoprotein also implicated in viral genome replication and in modulating cell signaling pathways. We describe the structure of the two proteolytically resistant domains of the N protein from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a prototype coronavirus. These domains are located at its N- and C-terminal ends (NTD and CTD, respectively). The NTD of the IBV Gray strain at 1.3-Å resolution exhibits a U-shaped structure, with two arms rich in basic residues, providing a module for specific interaction with RNA. The CTD forms a tightly intertwined dimer with an intermolecular four-stranded central β-sheet platform flanked by α helices, indicating that the basic building block for coronavirus nucleocapsid formation is a dimeric assembly of N protein. The variety of quaternary arrangements of the NTD and CTD revealed by the analysis of the different crystal forms delineates possible interfaces that could be used for the formation of a flexible filamentous ribonucleocapsid. The striking similarity between the dimeric structure of CTD and the nucleocapsid-forming domain of a distantly related arterivirus indicates a conserved mechanism of nucleocapsid formation for these two viral families.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
