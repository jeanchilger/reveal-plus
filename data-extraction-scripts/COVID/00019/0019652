<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-09-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Synthesis and Characterization of a Native, Oligomeric Form of Recombinant Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein</TITLE><BODY>We have expressed and characterized the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein in cDNA-transfected mammalian cells. The full-length spike protein (S) was newly synthesized as an endoglycosidase H (endo H)-sensitive glycoprotein (gp170) that is further modified into an endo H-resistant glycoprotein (gp180) in the Golgi apparatus. No substantial proteolytic cleavage of S was observed, suggesting that S is not processed into head (S1) and stalk (S2) domains as observed for certain other coronaviruses. While the expressed full-length S glycoprotein was exclusively cell associated, a truncation of S by excluding the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains resulted in the expression of an endoplasmic reticulum-localized glycoprotein (gp160) as well as a Golgi-specific form (gp170) which was ultimately secreted into the cell culture medium. Chemical cross-linking, thermal denaturation, and size fractionation analyses suggested that the full-length S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV forms a higher order structure of ∼500 kDa, which is consistent with it being an S homotrimer. The latter was also observed in purified virions. The intracellular form of the C-terminally truncated S protein (but not the secreted form) also forms trimers, but with much less efficiency than full-length S. Deglycosylation of the full-length homotrimer with peptide N-glycosidase-F under native conditions abolished recognition of the protein by virus-neutralizing antisera raised against purified virions, suggesting the importance of the carbohydrate in the correct folding of the S protein. These data should aid in the design of recombinant vaccine antigens to prevent the spread of this emerging pathogen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
