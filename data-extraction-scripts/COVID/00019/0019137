Yet, many pathogens remain either unchallenged or inadequately hindered by commercially available vaccines. Respiratory viruses pose distinct and difficult challenges due to their ability to rapidly spread, adapt, and modify the host immune response. Considerable research has been directed to understand the role of respiratory virus immunomodulatory proteins and how they influence the host immune response. We review here efforts to develop next-generation vaccines through targeting these key immunomodulatory genes in influenza virus, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, measles virus, and mumps virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
