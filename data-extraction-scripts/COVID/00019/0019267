The CLEIA was established with an optical combination of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against SARS CoV N protein prepared from mice immunized with recombinant N protein without cultivating the virus. The capture and detecting MAbs of the CLEIA reacted to the carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal peptides of the N protein, respectively. The CLEIA was capable of detecting recombinant N protein at 1.56 pg/ml and viral N protein in SARS CoV cell culture lysates at 0.087 of 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml. The CLEIA showed no cross-reactivities to recombinant N proteins of common human CoV (229E, OC43, and NL63) or lysates of cells infected with 229E and OC43. In addition, an evaluation with 18 SARS-positive NPA samples, all confirmed SARS positive by quantitative PCR and antibodies to SARS CoV, revealed that all (18/18) were found positive by the CLEIA; thus, the sensitivity of detection was 100%. When we tested 20 SARS-negative NPA samples, the CLEIA was shown to have high specificity (100%). The sensitivity of our novel SARS CLEIA was significantly higher than the previous EIA and comparable to the other methods using reverse transcription-PCR.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
