We previously showed that one such protein, encoded by ORF6, enhanced the growth of mouse hepatitis virus in tissue culture cells and in mice. Protein 6 consists of an N-terminal hydrophobic peptide and a C-terminal region containing intracellular protein sorting motifs. Herein, we show that mutation of the hydrophobic region but not the sorting motifs affected the ability of protein 6 to enhance virus growth. Collectively, these results support the notion that the 6 protein interacts with membrane-bound viral replication or assembly machinery to directly enhance virus replication and virulence in animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
