The chimeric viral RNAs were incubated in cell-free reaction mixtures capable of supporting the sequential translation and replication of poliovirus RNA. Using preinitiation RNA replication complexes formed in these reactions, we demonstrated that the 3′ NTR of poliovirus RNA was insufficient, by itself, to recruit the viral replication proteins required for negative-strand RNA synthesis. The 5′-terminal cloverleaf of poliovirus RNA was required in cis to form functional preinitiation RNA replication complexes capable of uridylylating VPg and initiating the synthesis of negative-strand RNA. These results are consistent with a model in which the 5′-terminal cloverleaf and 3′ NTRs of poliovirus RNA interact via temporally dynamic ribonucleoprotein complexes to coordinately mediate and regulate the sequential translation and replication of poliovirus RNA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
