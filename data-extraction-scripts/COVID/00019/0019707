We previously showed that if the five interacting amino acids which differ between hamster and human DPP4 are changed to the residues found in human DPP4, hamster DPP4 does act as a receptor. Here, we show that the functionality of hamster DPP4 as a receptor is severely decreased if less than 4 out of 5 amino acids are changed. IMPORTANCE The novel emerging coronavirus MERS-CoV has infected >1,600 people worldwide, and the case fatality rate is ∼36%. In this study, we show that by changing 4 amino acids in hamster DPP4, this protein functions as a receptor for MERS-CoV. This work is vital in the development of new small-animal models, which will broaden our understanding of MERS-CoV and be instrumental in the development of countermeasures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
