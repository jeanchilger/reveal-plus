We reported that the soluble form of MHV receptor (soMHVR) transformed a nonfusogenic S protein into a fusogenic one (F. Taguchi and S. Matsuyama, J. Virol. 76:950-958, 2002). In the present study, we demonstrate that soMHVR induces the conformational changes of the S protein, as shown by the proteinase digestion test. A cl-2 mutant, srr7, of the MHV JHM virus (JHMV) was digested with proteinase K after treatment with soMHVR, and the resultant S protein was analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody (MAb) 10G, specific for the membrane-anchored S2 subunit. A 58-kDa fragment, encompassing the two heptad repeats in S2, was detected when srr7 was digested after soMHVR treatment, while no band was seen when the virus was untreated. The appearance of the proteinase-resistant fragment was dependent on the temperature and time of srr7 incubation with soMHVR and also on the concentration of soMHVR. Coimmunoprecipitation indicated that the direct binding of soMHVR to srr7 S protein induced these conformational changes; this was also suggested by the inhibition of the changes following pretreatment of soMHVR with anti-MHVR MAb CC1. soMHVR induced conformational changes of the S proteins of wild-type (wt) JHMV cl-2, as well as revertants from srr7, srr7A and srr7B; however, a major proportion of these S proteins were resistant to proteinase K even without soMHVR treatment. The implications of this proteinase-resistant fraction are discussed. This is the first report on receptor-induced conformational changes of the membrane-anchored fragment of the coronavirus S protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
