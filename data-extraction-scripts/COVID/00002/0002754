Many patients manifested a mild clinical illness but some developed pneumonia and respiratory failure. High mortality was observed in patients with severe disease. Among survivors, studies are limited. Ground-glass opacities on a high-resolution computerized tomography scan and reduced diffusion capacity were noted after 3 months in a study.

We are presenting an unusual case of swine flu pneumonia who developed interstitial lung disease after recovery.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
