B-cell lymphoma is unique in this context as tumor cells express TLR9 and may harbor latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gamma-herpesvirus with remarkable oncogenic potential when latent. Latent EBV may be promoted by TLR9 triggering via suppression of lytic EBV. Here, we elaborated an initial assessment of the impact of TLR9 triggering on EBV-positive and EBV-negative B-cell lymphoma using Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines as an in vitro model. We show that, independent of the presence of EBV, the TLR9 ligand oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) CpG-2006 may or may not induce caspase-dependent cell death in BL cells. Moreover, ODN CpG-2006-induced cell death responses of BL cells were associated with TLR9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs5743836 or rs352140, which we detected in primary BL tumors and in peripheral blood from healthy individuals at similar frequencies. Thus, our findings suggest that the effect of TLR9 agonists on BL cells should be tested in vitro before installment of therapy and TLR9 SNPs in BL patients should be determined as potential biological markers for the therapeutic response to treatment targeting innate immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
