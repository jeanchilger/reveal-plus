<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1999-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Production of high titre disabled infectious single cycle (DISC) HSV from a microcarrier culture</TITLE><BODY>Disabled Infectious Single Cycle (DISC) HSV-2 has been cultured in the complimentary cell line CR2 to provide high titre bulk material suitable for the purification of the virus as a live viral vaccine. CR2 cells are cultured on the microcarrier Cytodex-1 at 5 g l-1 in small scale (1 l) and larger scale (15 l) reactors. The cells are infected at an MOI of 0.01 pfu cell-1 and the culture harvested 60–72 h later. The infected cells are removed from the microcarriers by the addition of a hypotonic saline and the virus released by low-pressure disruption techniques. Virus titres achieved are compared to the standard roller bottle process. The resulting material is the starting point for the purification of the DISC-HSV virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
