The known isoforms of PSG16 are N-terminally truncated relative to other PSG family proteins and are expressed in neurons as well as in the placenta. We have cloned a novel full-length isoform of psg16 that is also expressed in the brain, placenta, and retina but, like the truncated form, lacks MHV receptor activity when expressed on 293T cells, suggesting that PSG16 does not mediate CEACAM1a-independent spread of MHV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
