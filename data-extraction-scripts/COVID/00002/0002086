Limited information is available on the etiology and clinical characteristics of the influenza-like illness (ILI) that ensued in adults following the pH1N1 pandemic. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data of ILI in adults was collected. A total of 279 throat swabs were tested for twelve respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical characteristics of influenza A in outpatients versus test-negative patients were compared using Pearson's χ2 and the Mann-Whitney U test. 190 swabs were tested for pH1N1 by virus isolation. Consultation rates for ILI were compared between 2009 and 2010. RESULTS: One or two virus were detected in 29% of the samples. Influenza A virus (FLU-A) accounted for 22.9% (64/279). Other viruses were present at a frequency less than 3.0%. Cough was significantly associated with Influenza A virus infection (χ2, p<0.001). The positive rate of FLU-A was consistent with changes in the ILI rate during the same period and there was a significant reduction in the incidence of ILI in 2010 when compared to 2009. During the 2010–2011 influenza season, the incidence peaked in January 2011 in Beijing and north China. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to pH1N1 had no impact on typical influenza seasonal peaks, although FLU-A remained the predominant virus for 2010 in Beijing. Symptomatically, cough was associated with FLU-A infection. The positive rate of influenza virus was consistent with changes in the ILI rate during the same period and there was a significant reduction in the incidence of ILI in 2010 when compared to that of 2009.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
