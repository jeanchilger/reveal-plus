<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-10-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Influenza Viral RNA Detection in Blood as a Marker to Predict Disease Severity in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients</TITLE><BODY>Influenza RNA in blood (viremia) was detected in 9 of 79 (11.4%) hematopoietic cell transplant recipients with influenza, and was less frequently observed in patients with upper respiratory tract disease only and more frequently in patients infected with 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 strain (versus seasonal strains). Viremia increased the risk of progression to lower respiratory tract disease (LRD), hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and overall and influenza-related death. Among patients with LRD, viremia was associated with increased hazards of overall and influenza-associated death (hazard ratio 3.5, 1.1–12). Thus, influenza viremia may serve as marker for overall poor outcome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
