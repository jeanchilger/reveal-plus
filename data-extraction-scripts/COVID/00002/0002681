<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-06-04</DATELINE><TITLE>VIGOR extended to annotate genomes for additional 12 different viruses</TITLE><BODY>A gene prediction program, VIGOR (Viral Genome ORF Reader), was developed at J. Craig Venter Institute in 2010 and has been successfully performing gene calling in coronavirus, influenza, rhinovirus and rotavirus for projects at the Genome Sequencing Center for Infectious Diseases. VIGOR uses sequence similarity search against custom protein databases to identify protein coding regions, start and stop codons and other gene features. Ribonucleicacid editing and other features are accurately identified based on sequence similarity and signature residues. VIGOR produces four output files: a gene prediction file, a complementary DNA file, an alignment file, and a gene feature table file. The gene feature table can be used to create GenBank submission. VIGOR takes a single input: viral genomic sequences in FASTA format. VIGOR has been extended to predict genes for 12 viruses: measles virus, mumps virus, rubella virus, respiratory syncytial virus, alphavirus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, norovirus, metapneumovirus, yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, parainfluenza virus and Sendai virus. VIGOR accurately detects the complex gene features like ribonucleicacid editing, stop codon leakage and ribosomal shunting. Precisely identifying the mat_peptide cleavage for some viruses is a built-in feature of VIGOR. The gene predictions for these viruses have been evaluated by testing from 27 to 240 genomes from GenBank.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
