Here, we updated this meta-analysis and additionally assessed the association of this polymorphism with ALI/ARDS mortality. METHODS: We searched electronic databases through October 2011 for the terms “angiotensin-converting enzyme gene”, “acute lung injury”, and “acute respiratory distress syndrome,” and reviewed all studies that reported the relationship of the I/D polymorphism in ACE with ALI/ARDS in humans. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 532 ALI/ARDS patients, 3032 healthy controls, and 1432 patients without ALI/ARDS. We used three genetic models: the allele, dominant, and recessive models. RESULTS: The ACE I/D polymorphism was not associated with susceptibility to ALI/ARDS for any genetic model. However, the ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with the mortality risk of ALI/ARDS in Asian subjects ( P(allele) < 0.0001, P(dominant) = 0.001, P(recessive) = 0.002). This finding remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: There is a possible association between the ACE I/D polymorphism genotype and the mortality risk of ALI/ARDS in Asians.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
