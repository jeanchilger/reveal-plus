<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-02-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Real-Time Reverse Transcription–Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay for SARS-associated Coronavirus</TITLE><BODY>A real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed to rapidly detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The assay, based on multiple primer and probe sets located in different regions of the SARS-CoV genome, could discriminate SARS-CoV from other human and animal coronaviruses with a potential detection limit of <10 genomic copies per reaction. The real-time RT-PCR assay was more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay or culture isolation and proved suitable to detect SARS-CoV in clinical specimens. Application of this assay will aid in diagnosing SARS-CoV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
