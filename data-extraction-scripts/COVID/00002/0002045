After 3-day-old goslings were orally inoculated with a NGVEV-CN strain suspension, the time course of NGVEV effects on apoptotic morphological changes of the internal tissues was evaluated. These changes were observed by histological analysis with light microscopy and ultrastructural analysis with transmission electron microscopy. DNA fragmentation was assessed with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA ladder analysis. A series of characteristic apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation and margination, cytoplasmic shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies were noted. Apoptosis was readily observed in the lymphoid and gastrointestinal organs, and sporadically occurred in other organs after 3 days post-infection (PI). The presence and quantity of TUNEL-positive cells increased with infection time until 9 days PI. DNA extracted from the NGVEV-infected gosling cells displayed characteristic 180~200 bp ladders. Apoptotic cells were ubiquitously distributed, especially among lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and epithelial and intestinal cells. Necrosis was subsequently detected during the late NGVEV-infection phase, which was characterized by cell swelling, plasma membrane collapse, and rapidly lysis. Our results suggested that apoptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of NGVE disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
