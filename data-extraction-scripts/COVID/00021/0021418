MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 459 hospitalized children and adult RTI patients were screened for respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction from April 2013 to April 2016. The VP2 gene from WU virus (WUV)-positive samples was sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Of the 459 hospitalized RTI patients, 18 (3.9$) patients were positive for WUV infection. WUV infection was common among children aged ≤11 years (9 patients, 50$). Among the 18 WUV-infected hospitalized patients, viral co-infection was detected in 9 patients (50$). The most common viruses associated with mixed infection were respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus (2 patients, 11.1$ each). Of the 18 WUV-infected patients, 4 were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The circulating strains belong to type Ia and IIIb. CONCLUSION: This study enabled us to detect WUV among hospitalized RTI patients. Co-infection with other respiratory viruses was notable. Two circulating WUV genotypes (Ia and IIIb) were identified among hospitalized RTI patients in Kuwait.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
