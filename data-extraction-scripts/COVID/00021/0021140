Arbely, Z. Granot, I. Kass, J. Orly, and I. T. Arkin, Biochemistry 45:11349-11356, 2006). Here, we show that the GxxxG motif is not involved in SARS S oligomerization by trimerization analysis of S GxxxG mutant proteins. In addition, the capability of S to mediate entry of SARS S-pseudotyped particles overall was affected moderately in the mutant proteins, also arguing for a nonvital role for the GxxxG motif in SARS coronavirus entry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
