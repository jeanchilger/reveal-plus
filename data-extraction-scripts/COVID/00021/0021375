We report the crystal structure of nsp10 from SARS-CoV at 2.1-Å resolution. The nsp10 structure has a novel fold, and 12 identical subunits assemble to form a unique spherical dodecameric architecture. Two zinc fingers have been identified from the nsp10 monomer structure with the sequence motifs C-(X)(2)-C-(X)(5)-H-(X)(6)-C and C-(X)(2)-C-(X)(7)-C-(X)-C. The nsp10 crystal structure is the first of a new class of zinc finger protein three-dimensional structures to be revealed experimentally. The zinc finger sequence motifs are conserved among all three coronavirus antigenic groups, implicating an essential function for nsp10 in all coronaviruses. Based on the structure, we propose that nsp10 is a transcription factor for coronavirus replication/transcription.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
