The specific function of nsp1 is not known. Here we report the nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the nsp1 segment from residue 13 to 128, which represents a novel α/β-fold formed by a mixed parallel/antiparallel six-stranded β-barrel, an α-helix covering one opening of the barrel, and a 3(10)-helix alongside the barrel. We further characterized the full-length 179-residue protein and show that the polypeptide segments of residues 1 to 12 and 129 to 179 are flexibly disordered. The structure is analyzed in a search for possible correlations with the recently reported activity of nsp1 in the degradation of mRNA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
