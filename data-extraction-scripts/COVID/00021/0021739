In this review, the literature was searched to make an overview of what is known on the expression of the proline-specific peptidases dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 4, 8, 9, prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) and fibroblast activation protein α (FAP) in the healthy and diseased lung. Search terms included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, fibrosis, ischemia reperfusion injury and pneumonia. Knowledge on the loss or gain of protein expression and activity during disease might tie these enzymes to certain cell types, substrates or interaction partners that are involved in the pathophysiology of the disease, ultimately leading to the elucidation of their functional roles and a potential therapeutic target. Most data could be found on DPP4, while the other enzymes are less explored. Published data however often appear to be conflicting, the applied methods divers and the specificity of the assays used questionable. In conclusion, information on the expression of the proline-specific peptidases in the healthy and diseased lung is lacking, begging for further well-designed research.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
