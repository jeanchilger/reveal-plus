However, the diverse HLA alleles among humans complicate virus-specific cellular immunity research, and elucidation of cross-HLA allele T cell responses to influenza virus specificity requires further detailed work. An ideal CTL epitope-based vaccine would cover a broad spectrum of epitope antigens presented by most, if not all, of the HLAs. Here, we evaluated the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus-specific T cell responses among the HLA-A24(+) population using a rationally designed peptide pool during the 2009 pandemic. Unexpectedly, cross-HLA allele T cell responses against the influenza A virus peptides were detected among both HLA-A11(+) and HLA-A24(+) donors. Furthermore, we found cross-responses in the entire HLA-A3 supertype population (including HLA-A11, -A31, -A33, and -A30). The cross-allele antigenic peptides within the peptide pool were identified and characterized, and the crystal structures of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes were determined. The subsequent HLA-A24-defined cross-allele peptides recognized by the HLA-A11(+) population were shown to mildly bind to the HLA-A*1101 molecule. Together with the structural models, these results partially explain the cross-allele responses. Our findings elucidate the promiscuity of the cross-allele T cell responses against influenza A viruses and are beneficial for the development of a T cell epitope-based vaccine applied in a broader population.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
