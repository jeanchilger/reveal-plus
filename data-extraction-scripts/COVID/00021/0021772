Recently, nitrogen- and carbon-doped TiO(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination. Their antibacterial activity, however, remains to be quantified. In this study, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates have superior visible-light-induced bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli compared to pure TiO(2) and carbon-doped TiO(2) substrates. We also found that protein- and light-absorbing contaminants partially reduce the bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates due to their light-shielding effects. In the pathogen-killing experiment, a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens, including Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Acinetobacter baumannii, were killed by visible-light-illuminated nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates than by pure TiO(2) substrates. These findings suggest that nitrogen-doped TiO(2) has potential application in the development of alternative disinfectants for environmental and medical usages.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
