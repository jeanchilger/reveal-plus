<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-05-07</DATELINE><TITLE>In Vitro Resistance Selection and In Vivo Efficacy of Morpholino Oligomers against West Nile Virus</TITLE><BODY>We characterize in vitro resistance to and demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of two antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) against West Nile virus (WNV). Both PMOs were conjugated with an Arg-rich peptide. One peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) binds to the 5′ terminus of the viral genome (5′-end PPMO); the other targets an essential 3′ RNA element required for genome cyclization (3′ conserved sequence I [3′ CSI] PPMO). The 3′ CSI PPMO displayed a broad spectrum of antiflavivirus activity, suppressing WNV, Japanese encephalitis virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus, as demonstrated by reductions in viral titers of 3 to 5 logs in cell cultures, likely due to the absolute conservation of the 3′ CSI PPMO-targeted sequences among these viruses. The selection and sequencing of PPMO-resistant WNV showed that the 5′-end-PPMO-resistant viruses contained two to three mismatches within the PPMO-binding site whereas the 3′ CSI PPMO-resistant viruses accumulated mutations outside the PPMO-targeted region. The mutagenesis of a WNV infectious clone demonstrated that the mismatches within the PPMO-binding site were responsible for the 5′-end PPMO resistance. In contrast, a U insertion or a G deletion located within the 3′-terminal stem-loop of the viral genome was the determinant of the 3′ CSI PPMO resistance. In a mouse model, both the 5′-end and 3′ CSI PPMOs (administered at 100 or 200 μg/day) partially protected mice from WNV disease, with minimal to no PPMO-mediated toxicity. A higher treatment dose (300 μg/day) caused toxicity. Unconjugated PMOs (3 mg/day) showed neither efficacy nor toxicity, suggesting the importance of the peptide conjugate for efficacy. The results suggest that a modification of the peptide conjugate composition to reduce its toxicity yet maintain its ability to effectively deliver PMO into cells may improve PMO-mediated therapy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
