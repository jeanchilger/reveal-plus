Previously, coexpression of two putative transmembrane nonstructural proteins (nsp2 and nsp3) was found to suffice to induce these remarkable membrane structures, which are typical of arterivirus infection. Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the role of nsp3 in more detail. Liberation of the hydrophobic N terminus of nsp3, which is normally achieved by cleavage of the nsp2/3 junction by the nsp2 protease, was nonessential for the formation of DMVs. However, the substitution of each of a cluster of four conserved cysteine residues, residing in a predicted luminal loop of nsp3, completely blocked DMV formation. Some of these mutant nsp3 proteins were also found to be highly cytotoxic, in particular, exerting a dramatic effect on the endoplasmic reticulum. The functionality of an engineered N glycosylation site in the cysteine-containing loop confirmed both its presence in the lumen and the transmembrane nature of nsp3. This mutant displayed an interesting intermediate phenotype in terms of DMV formation, with paired and curved membranes being formed, but DMV formation apparently being impaired. The effect of nsp3 mutations on replicase polyprotein processing was investigated, and several mutations were found to influence processing of the region downstream of nsp3 by the nsp4 main protease. When tested in an EAV reverse genetics system, none of the nsp3 mutations was tolerated, again underlining the crucial role of the protein in the arterivirus life cycle.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
