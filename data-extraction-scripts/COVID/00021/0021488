In this study we evaluated the potential of vectors based on several of these novel AAVs as vaccine carriers for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag. Studies with mice indicated that vectors based on AAV type 7 (AAV7), AAV8, and AAV9 demonstrate improved immunogenicity in terms of Gag CD8(+) T-cell and Gag antibody responses. The quality of these antigen-specific responses was evaluated in detail for AAV2/8 vectors and compared to results with an adenovirus vector expressing Gag (AdC7). AAV2/8 produced a vibrant CD8(+) T-cell effector response characterized by coexpression of gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha as well as in vivo cytolytic activity. No CD8(+) T-cell response generated by any of the AAVs was effectively boosted with AdC7, a result consistent with the finding of a relative lack of cells expressing interleukin-2 (IL-2) or a central memory phenotype at 3 months after the prime. The primary response to an AdC7 vaccine differed from that generated by AAVs in that the peak effector response evolved into populations of Gag-specific T cells expressing high levels of cytokines, including IL-2, and with effector memory and central memory phenotypes. A number of mechanisms could be considered to explain the aberrant activation of CD8(+) T cells by AAV, including insufficient inflammatory responses, CD4 help, and/or chronic antigen expression and T-cell exhaustion. Interestingly, the B-cell response to AAV-encoded Gag was quite vibrant and easily boosted with AdC7.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
