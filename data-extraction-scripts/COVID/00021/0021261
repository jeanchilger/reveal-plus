<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-02-01</DATELINE><TITLE>High Prevalence of Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus in Young Dromedary Camels in Jordan</TITLE><BODY>Prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was determined in 45 dromedary camels from two geographically separated herds in Jordan. Virus shedding was only detected in swabs obtained from the respiratory tract and primarily observed in camels younger than 3 years. MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age of camels. Bovine and sheep sera were seronegative. Phylogenetic analysis of partial S2 clustered the Jordanian MERS-CoV strains with contemporary MERS-CoV strains associated with nosocomial outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
