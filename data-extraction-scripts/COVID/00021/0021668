To develop serological assays for bovine noroviruses (BoNVs) and to determine the cross-reactivity of BoNV with human noroviruses, we generated two recombinant baculoviruses, rCV186-OH and rJNCV, to express the capsid genes of Bo/CV186-OH/00/US (Norovirus genogroup III [GIII], genotype 2 [GIII/2]). rCV186-OH expressed the expected 57-kDa capsid protein, but rJNCV expressed a truncated capsid protein of 35 kDa. Sequence analysis of rJNCV identified a single nucleotide deletion in the P domain of the capsid gene, which introduced a stop codon at amino acid 323. The recombinant capsid protein produced by rCV186-OH but not that produced by rJNCV self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) similar to native BoNV. An antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and antigen-capture ELISA (Ag-ELISA) detected serum antibody and antigen, respectively, from calves infected with Bo/CV186-OH/00/US but not antibodies or antigens to other enteric viruses. In other tests of the GIII/2 BoNV Ag-ELISA, no cross-reactivity was observed with VLPs from one GI and four GII human noroviruses and porcine sapovirus Cowden strain. Because, like human noroviruses, BoNVs do not grow in cell culture, the BoNV VLPs will be useful in the serological assays described for the detection of BoNV antibody and antigen. Consistent with the phylogenetic analysis of the capsid genes of bovine and human noroviruses (M. G. Han, J. R. Smiley, C. Thomas, and L. J. Saif, J. Clin. Microbiol. 42:5214-5224, 2004), the results suggest that GIII/2 BoNV does not share significant antigenic relationships with the five characterized human noroviruses tested.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
