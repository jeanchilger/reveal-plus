Here, we have investigated the effect of an acute viral infection on the cellular composition and bacterial protection in Mycobacterium bovis strain bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-induced granulomas using an immunocompetent and a partially immunodeficient murine model. Acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) coinfection of C57BL/6 mice led to substantial accumulation of gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-producing LCMV-specific T cells in liver granulomas and increased local IFN-γ. Despite traffic of activated T cells that resulted in a CD8 T-cell-dominated granuloma, the BCG liver organ load was unaltered from control levels. In OT-1 T-cell-receptor (TCR) transgenic mice, ovalbumin (OVA) immunization or LCMV coinfection of BCG-infected mice induced CD8 T-cell-dominated granulomas containing large numbers of non-BCG-specific activated T cells. The higher baseline BCG organ load in this CD8 TCR transgenic animal allowed us to demonstrate that OVA immunization and LCMV coinfection increased anti-BCG protection. The bacterial load remained substantially higher than in mice with a more complete TCR repertoire. Overall, the present study suggests that peripherally activated CD8 T cells can be recruited to chronic inflammatory sites, but their contribution to protective immunity is limited to conditions of underlying immunodeficiency.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
