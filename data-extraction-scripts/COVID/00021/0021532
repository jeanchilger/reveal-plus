A 3′ translational enhancer in Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) overlaps an internal T-shaped structure (TSS) that binds to 60S ribosomal subunits. The higher-order structure in the region was examined through alteration of critical sequences revealing novel interactions between an H-type pseudoknot and upstream residues, and between the TSS and internal and terminal loops of an upstream hairpin. Our results suggest that the TSS forms a stable scaffold that allows for simultaneous interactions with external sequences through base pairings on both sides of its large internal symmetrical loop. Binding of TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to the region potentiates a widespread conformational shift with substantial rearrangement of the TSS region, including the element required for efficient ribosome binding. Degrading the RdRp caused the RNA to resume its original conformation, suggesting that the initial conformation is thermodynamically favored. These results suggest that the 3′ end of TCV folds into a compact, highly interactive structure allowing RdRp access to multiple elements including the 3′ end, which causes structural changes that potentiate the shift between translation and replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
