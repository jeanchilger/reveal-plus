<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-03-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Atrial myxoma presenting as infective endocarditis</TITLE><BODY>A 23-year-old Asian student presented to our service with a 1-month history of fever, weight loss of 10 kg, night sweats, fatigue and general malaise. He was previously well with no significant medical or family history. He had a low-grade pyrexia and cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur consistent with ‘tumour plop’. He had no sequelae of endocarditis. He had low-grade pyrexia of 37.7°C, and ECG showed sinus tachycardia at 130 bpm. He had raised inflammatory markers and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans twice. Transthoracic and transo-oesophageal echocardiography revealed a large mobile mass attached to the interatrial septum, suspicious for atrial myxoma, flopping into the left ventricle but not causing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. All valves looked normal in appearance. He was treated with antibiotics for 2 weeks until inflammatory markers normalised. The patient was referred for cardiothoracic surgery where a large atrial myxoma (5 cm×3 cm) was excised just superior to the mitral valve. It had areas of necrosis and was colonised with S. viridans. He had an unremarkable postoperative course and made a complete recovery.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
