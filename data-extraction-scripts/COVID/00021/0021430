One of these accessory proteins is set apart by its function in the context of a related murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infection. SARS-CoV protein 6 increases MHV neurovirulence and accelerates MHV infection kinetics in tissue culture. Protein 6 also blocks nuclear import of macromolecules from the cytoplasm, a process known to involve its C-terminal residues interacting with cellular importins. In this study, protein 6 was expressed from plasmid DNAs and accumulated in cells prior to infection by wild-type MHV. Output of MHV progeny was significantly increased by preexisting protein 6. Protein 6 with C-terminal deletion mutations no longer interfered with nuclear import processes but still retained much of the capacity to augment MHV infections. However, some virus growth-enhancing activity could be ascribed to the C-terminal end of protein 6. To determine whether this augmentation provided by the C terminus was derived from interference with nuclear import, we evaluated the virus-modulating effects of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against importin-β mRNAs, which down-regulated classical nuclear import pathways. The siRNAs did indeed prime cells for enhanced MHV infection. Our findings indicated that protein 6-mediated nuclear import blocks augmented MHV infections but is clearly not the only way that this accessory protein operates to create a milieu conducive to robust virus growth. Thus, the SARS-CoV protein 6 accelerates MHV infections by more than one mechanism.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
