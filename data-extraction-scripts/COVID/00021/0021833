<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-05-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Identification of Adenoviruses in Fecal Specimens from Wild Chimpanzees (Pan trogylodytes schweinfurthii) in Western Tanzania</TITLE><BODY>DNA of two distinctive adenoviruses was detected in wild chimpanzees in western Tanzania that showed clinical signs of acute, upper respiratory disease, notably coughing. The amplified sequences from part of the capsid hexon gene suggests that one virus is a novel adenovirus serotype candidate and the other virus is a species C adenovirus most closely related to recent isolates from captive chimpanzees in the United States, Simian AdV 37 with 86% nucleic acid identity and Simian AdV 40 with 95% nucleic acid identity, respectively. The species C adenovirus sequences suggest possible recombination with a human adenovirus. The source of these viruses and disease association is not known.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
