We have investigated extra-articular cartilage involvement in two commonly used animal models for RA, collagen-induced and pristane-induced arthritis, by immunizing rats with different susceptibility to disease (LEW.1 A, LEW.1F and DA rats). We found that nasal and tracheolaryngeal cartilage is affected in LEW.1 A and DA rats to varying degrees in collagen-induced arthritis but not in any strain in the pristane-induced model. Antibodies to matrilin-1, a cartilage-specific protein expressed mainly in tracheolaryngeal and nasal cartilage but not in joints, were positively associated with the presence of inflammation in nasal cartilage. In contrast, no antibody response to matrilin-1 could be detected in pristane-induced arthritis. In addition, nasal vaccination with collagen type II prior to immunization in DA rats significantly decreased the antibody response to matrilin-1 at day 56, but not at earlier time points, indicating a late protective effect on extra-articular cartilage. We conclude that pristane-induced arthritis is a joint-specific model whereas collagen-induced arthritis affect joints as well as extra-articular cartilage. Furthermore, collagen immunization induces an antibody response to matrilin-1.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
