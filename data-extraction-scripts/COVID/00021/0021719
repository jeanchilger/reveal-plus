In some instances, novel pathogens have been identified. What has been less well appreciated is that novel virus discoveries in distinct hosts have led to the establishment of unique experimental systems to define host-virus interactions. These new systems have opened new frontiers in the study of fundamental virology and infectious disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
