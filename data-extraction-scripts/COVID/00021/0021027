<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Evaluation of a Human Group A Rotavirus Assay for On-Site Detection of Bovine Rotavirus</TITLE><BODY>Neonatal diarrhea induced by bovine group A rotavirus causes significant economic loss in the dairy and beef industry due to increased morbidity and mortality, treatment costs, and reduced growth rates. The objective of this study was to evaluate a human group A rotavirus assay (ImmunoCardSTAT Rotavirus [ICS-RV]) as an on-site diagnostic test for bovine rotavirus. When used with a collection of bovine diarrhea samples submitted to the Virology Section of the Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health at Michigan State University and compared to a bovine group A rotavirus-specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), the ICS-RV assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 87.0 and 93.6%, respectively. A commercially available group A rotavirus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Pathfinder; Sanofi Diagnostics, Redmond, Wash.), when used with the same fecal sample collection and compared to the same RT-PCR, had a sensitivity and specificity of 78.3 and 67.7%, respectively. Subsequently, the ICS-RV assay, RT-PCR, and a different commercially available group A rotavirus ELISA (Rotaclone; Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, Ohio) were used to evaluate fecal samples collected from neonatal calves experimentally infected with bovine rotavirus. When diarrheic fecal samples that were positive for bovine rotavirus by RT-PCR were evaluated, the ICS-RV assay and the Rotaclone assay detected bovine rotavirus 85 and 95% of the time, respectively. Based on these studies, the ICS-RV assay appears to be an excellent test for detecting group A bovine rotaviruses. This assay may be useful as an on-site diagnostic test for veterinarians as an aid in the management of bovine neonatal diarrhea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
