Because the binding modes of small molecule inhibitors of 6HB formation are largely unknown, precisely how they disrupt 6HB formation remains unclear, and structure-based design of improved inhibitors is thus seriously hampered. Here we present the high resolution crystal structure of TMC353121, a potent inhibitor of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bound at a hydrophobic pocket of the 6HB formed by amino acid residues from both HR1 and HR2 heptad-repeats. Binding of TMC353121 stabilizes the interaction of HR1 and HR2 in an alternate conformation of the 6HB, in which direct binding interactions are formed between TMC353121 and both HR1 and HR2. Rather than completely preventing 6HB formation, our data indicate that TMC353121 inhibits fusion by causing a local disturbance of the natural 6HB conformation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
