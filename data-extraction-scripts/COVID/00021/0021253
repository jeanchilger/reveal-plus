Nectin-1 is an α-herpesvirus receptor that binds to virion glycoprotein D. Nectin-1 mediates entry of PRV, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and bovine herpesvirus type 1. To assess the antiviral potential of an ectopic expression of the nectin-1 ectodomain in vivo, six transgenic mouse lines expressing a soluble form of nectin-1, consisting of an extracellular domain of porcine nectin-1 and the Fc portion of human IgG1, were generated. All of the transgenic mouse lines showed nearly complete resistance to PRV infection by means of both i.p. and intranasal routes. These results suggest that the introduction into farm animals of a transgene encoding a soluble form of nectin-1 would offer a potent biological approach to generating α-herpesvirus-resistant livestock.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
