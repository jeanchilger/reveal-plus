Using T-cell knockout (KO) mice adoptively reconstituted with splenocytes from immunologically naive mice, we examined the immune responses of an immune system derived from homeostatically proliferating (HP) T cells. HP cells mounted relatively normal acute CD8 T-cell responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), but with altered T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, and they became functional memory cells capable of recall responses. Although homeostatic proliferation does not normally fully restore T-cell numbers, the CD8(+) T-cell pool was completely restored in T-cell KO mice after LCMV infection. CD4 T-cell responses were lower and not fully restored but seemed sufficient to allow for complete differentiation of CD8 memory T cells. The LCMV-immune HP mouse had an immune repertoire heavily biased with LCMV epitope-specific T cells with oligoclonal expansions. LCMV-immune HP mice had reduced cross-reactive and non–cross-reactive CD8 T-cell responses when challenged with a T cell–cross-reactive virus. Thus, whereas an HP immune system is capable of mounting relatively normal acute and memory CD8 T-cell responses, the narrowing of the T-cell repertoire may reduce immune responses to subsequently encountered pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
