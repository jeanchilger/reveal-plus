In the current study, the gene designs for V and F1, two well-studied virulent factors serving as main targets for vaccine development, were altered to explore additional options in hopes of improving the protective immunity of DNA vaccines expressing these two antigens. Compared to the wild type V gene DNA vaccines, the use of codon optimized V gene sequences was effective in improving the antigen expression, titers of anti-V antibody responses, and survival against a mucosal lethal challenge. For the F1 DNA vaccine, removal of the N-terminal hydrophobic region was able to improve protective immunity. However, adding a mammalian signal peptide sequence to F1 actually led to reduced protection despite it inducing slightly higher anti-F1 antibody responses. The F1 gene can be fused with a gene coding for YscF, a newly confirmed partial protective antigen for Y. pestis, to produce DNA vaccines that express fused F1 and YscF antigens. One design, in particular, that had YscF fused to the downstream sequence of F1, produced better protection than separate F1 or YscF DNA vaccines, suggesting a potential synergistic effect between these two antigens. Findings from the above studies indicated that there are multiple approaches to optimize the protective immunity for plague DNA vaccines. Most importantly, proper antigen engineering to produce optimal antigen gene inserts in DNA vaccines can clearly play a major role in the future designs of a wide range of DNA vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
