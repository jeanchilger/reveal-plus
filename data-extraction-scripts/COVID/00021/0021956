METHODS: We carried out a study to investigate the antimicrobial effects of each of the 5 substances comprising virus block (VB): 3 PMs that have antibacterial and antiviral activity, an antibiotic agent, and an antibacterial agent. We also investigated the effectiveness of the addition of VB to moist hand towels in a study involving 120 volunteers. The time-dependent changes in metal ion concentrations in aqueous VB solution were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. RESULTS: The metal elements in the aqueous VB solution remained stable for 12 weeks without undergoing time-dependent changes. DISCUSSION: Further investigations were performed to study hand hygiene using moist hand towels in daily life settings. To this end, 120 volunteers provided 240 specimens that were used to investigate the presence of antibacterial compounds on the volunteers' hands before and after hand towel use. An aliquot of each specimen was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and plated on agar media, and the number of colonies formed was counted. Normal bacterial flora found on the hands of the volunteers was investigated before and after the use of 4 different moist hand towels. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of VB and PMs were superior to those of commercial moist hand towels, indicating that effective data were obtained that may be useful for the practical application of the tested items.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
