Concurrent infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) did not affect the responses to dietary antigens at weaning, nor did it affect the subsequent development of tolerance. However, TGEV infection did enhance the primary immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG1, but not IgG2, antibody responses to injected soy in comparison to those of uninfected animals. Paradoxically, TGEV-infected animals showed an enhanced primary IgG1 antibody response to injected soy at 4 weeks of age, but they subsequently showed a reduced secondary response after an intraperitoneal challenge at 9 weeks of age in comparison to uninfected animals. The results suggest that an enteric virus, either used as a vaccine vector or present as a subclinical infection, may not have significant effects on the development of dietary allergies but may have effects both on the primary response and on the subsequent recall response to systemic antigens to which the animal is exposed concurrently with virus antigens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
