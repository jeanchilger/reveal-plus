In contrast, very little is known about the viral proteins. In the present report we have identified the membrane glycoprotein (M) of PEDV by use of rabbit anti-peptide sera and transient expression of the cloned M gene in Vero cells and by expression in the baculovirus system. The native M protein of PEDV is incorporated into virions, is N-glycosylated, and migrates with a relative mobility (Mr) of 27 k in polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, the M protein synthesized by recombinant baculoviruses migrates with a Mr of 23 k, that is, with identical mobility as the deglycosylated product of PEDV. Thus, it appears that M protein specified by the recombinant baculovirus is poorly, if at all, glycosylated. Using monoclonal antibodies and rabbit antipeptide sera specific for the N and C termini of the M protein, we were able to show that a 19 k band detected in PEDV-infected cells but not in virions represented a fragment of M from which the C terminus had been cleaved off. Finally, by electron microscopy and immunogold labelling, the relative orientation of M within the virion envelope was determined as NexoCcyt. In conclusion, all of these data strongly support the hypothesis that PEDV should be classified with the group I coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
