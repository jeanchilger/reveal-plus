<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1991</DATELINE><TITLE>Effect of in ovo bursectomy on the course of an infectious bronchitis virus infection in line C White Leghorn chickens</TITLE><BODY>White Leghorn line C chicks were surgically bursectomised (Bx) in ovo to eliminate antibody production. After inoculation with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) at 14 days after hatching, Bx chicks experienced a more severe and longer lasting infection than intact chicks. The severity and duration of clinical infection in the Bx chicks resembled that previously observed in the highly susceptible line 15 I chicks, however no increase in mortality was observed, in contrast to the high levels of mortality recorded in IBV-inoculated line 15 I chicks. After secondary challenge the degree of damage to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea was greater in the Bx chicks than in the intact chicks. The results indicate that, although antibodies play an important role in recovery from IBV infection, other immunological factor(s) may also be involved.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
