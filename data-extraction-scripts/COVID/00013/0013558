<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-11-15</DATELINE><TITLE>A novel CDPK1 inhibitor—a potential treatment for cryptosporidiosis in calves?</TITLE><BODY>Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic agent that infects humans and animals occasionally causing severe, watery diarrhoea. In immunocompetent hosts, cryptosporidiosis is self-limiting but can have a fatal outcome in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptosporidium is one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases (recreational water and drinking water) in humans, a leading cause of moderate to severe childhood diarrhoea, and a major agent of diarrhoea in calves leading to high economic losses and up to 10 % lethality. So far, available treatment options are insufficient for both veterinary and human clinical disease cases. Here, we report for the first time that the novel bumped kinase inhibitor (BKI) 1294 targeting the calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) of Cryptosporidium is able to reduce the oocyst shedding of C. parvum by calves—its natural host—without obvious side effects.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
