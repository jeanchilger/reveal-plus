<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003</DATELINE><TITLE>Recombinant viral sialate-O-acetylesterases</TITLE><BODY>Viral O-acetylesterases were first identified in several viruses, including influenza C viruses and coronaviruses. These enzymes are capable of removing cellular receptors from the surface of target cells. Hence they are also known as “receptor destroying” enzymes. We have cloned and expressed several recombinant viral O-acetylesterases. These enzymes were secreted from Sf9 insect cells as chimeric proteins fused to eGFP. A purification scheme to isolate the recombinant O-acetylesterase of influenza C virus was developed. The recombinant enzymes derived from influenza C viruses specifically hydrolyze 9-O-acetylated sialic acids, while that of sialodacryoadenitis virus, a rat coronavirus related to mouse hepatitis virus, is specific for 4-O-acetylated sialic acid. The recombinant esterases were shown to specifically de-O-acetylate sialic acids on glycoconjugates. We have also expressed esterase knockout proteins of the influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase. The recombinant viral proteins can be used to unambiguously identify O-acetylated acids in a variety of assays. Published in 2004..&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
