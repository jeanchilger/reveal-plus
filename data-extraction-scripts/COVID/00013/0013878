None of the five bacteria was able to adhere to healthy ductular epithelium but all showed a marked tropism for exposed connective tissue.S. aureus andE. coli induced a marked cytopathic effect in ductular epithelium after 6 hours in culture but the bacteria were not in close association with the affected tissue. No evidence could be found to support the hypothesis that adherence to epithelium might be the first stage in the pathogenesis of mastitis caused by these organisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
