<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1989</DATELINE><TITLE>Sequence of the coding regions from the 3.0 kb and 3.9 kb mRNA: Subgenomic species from a virulent isolate of transmissible gastroenteritis virus</TITLE><BODY>Subgenomic mRNA from a virulent isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was used to produce cDNA clones covering the genome region from the 3′ end of the pelomer gene to the start of the integral membrane protein gene. The nucleotide sequence of this area was determined using clone pTG11 and a previously reported cDNA clone pTG22. Three open reading frames (ORFs) were identified encoding putative polypeptides of relative molecular masses (M(r)) 6,600, 27,600, and 9,200. The sequence encoding the M(r) 9,200 polypeptide was found to be present on the “unique” 5′ region of the 3.0 kb mRNA species whereas the other two ORFs mapped on the 3.9 kb mRNA species. Differences between the ORFs from this strain of TGEV and those from a previously reported avirulent strain of TGEV were compared.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
