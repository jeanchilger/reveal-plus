This study is the only one of its kind in Kuwait, and its purpose was to investigate the genetic variability of the G protein gene in RSV strains prevalent in Kuwait. Respiratory samples were collected from patients with ARTIs in various hospitals in Kuwait and subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplifying a fragment of the G gene of RSV. A total of 305 samples were collected between January and mid-December 2016, and 77 (25.2%) were positive for RSV. Group A viruses were predominant over group B viruses; the RSV-A group was detected in 52 (67.5%) of the positive samples, while the RSV-B group was detected in 25 (32.5%) of the positive samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all RSV-A strains grouped into eight clusters of identical sequences of untyped strains. Twelve RSV-B strains, on the other hand, belonged to the RSV-B/BA10 genotype, while the rest were untyped. These data suggest that new and untyped strains of RSV-A group likely predominated in Kuwait and that the BA10 genotype of the RSV-B group became the dominant genotype in the 2016 season.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
