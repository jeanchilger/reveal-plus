Herein, we designed the peptide constructs derived from E5 and E7 oncoproteins of high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31 and 45 using the bioinformatics tools and investigated their potency in mice. RESULTS: The framework of the combined in silico/in vivo analysis included (1) to determine physicochemical properties of the designed constructs, (2) to identify potential IFN-γ-inducing epitopes, (3) to assess allergenicity, (4) to recognize linear and discontinuous B cell epitopes using modeling and validation of 3D structure of the designed constructs, and (5) to evaluate immune responses and tumor growth in vivo. Our in silico data determined high potency of the HPV(16,18,31,45) E5 and HPV(16,18,31,45) E7 peptides for trigger B- and T-cell responses, and IFN-γ secretion. In vivo study indicated that the mixture of E5 and E7 immunodominant peptides from four types of high-risk HPV could induce Th1 immune response, and protect completely mice against TC-1 tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Generally, the combined in silico/in vivo approaches showed the ability of the designed E5 and E7 peptide constructs from four major high-risk HPV types for development of therapeutic vaccines.
