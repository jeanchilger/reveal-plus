Six (14.5 %) of the fecal samples tested were positive for feline kobuviruses. The partial nucleotide sequences of feline kobuviruses based on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene were compared to those of other species. Feline kobuviruses were most closely related to canine kobuvirus in terms of their amino acid and nucleotide levels. In a phylogenetic tree, feline kobuviruses were also closely clustered with canine kobuvirus, Aichi virus (human), and mouse kobuvirus. This is the first report of the detection and genetic characterization of feline kobuviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
