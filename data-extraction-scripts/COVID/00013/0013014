Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of EV71 infection is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the IL-17F rs1889570 and rs4715290 gene polymorphisms in a Chinese Han population. Severe cases and cases with EV71 encephalitis had a significantly higher frequency of the rs1889570 T/T genotype and T allele. The serum IL-17F levels in rs1889570 T/T and C/T genotypes were also significantly elevated when compared to C/C genotypes. However, there was no significant difference observed in rs4715290 genotype distribution and allele frequency. These findings suggest that IL-17F rs1889570 gene polymorphisms are significantly associated with the susceptibility to severe EV71 infection in Chinese Han children.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
