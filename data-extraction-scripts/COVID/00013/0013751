By using Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we showed that the purified recombinant M protein could be recognized by four SARS-CoV-positive human sera even when those sera were 12,800-fold diluted. Furthermore, we characterized one representative IgG2 MAb, 3H9, which exhibited a strong immunoreaction to both recombinant M protein and native viral protein of SARS-CoV. We found a B-cell antigenic epitope located between amino acid 1–15 and defined the MAb recognizing region within amino acid 16–28 of M. These findings not only suggest that both recombinant M protein and its specific MAbs may be used as the diagnostic reagents for SARS, but also provide a potential target site for the design of an epitope-based vaccine against SARS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
