The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of neboviruses and noroviruses in cattle in China. Twenty-eight diarrhea fecal samples collected from 5 different farms were analyzed by RT-PCR. The results showed that 3 nebovirus positive samples were detected on 2 farms, with two strains being related to Bo/DijonA216/06/FR strain and the other one clustering with NB-like strains. Meanwhile, 3 norovirus positive samples were detected on 3 farms, all of which belonged to genotype 1. Our results confirmed the presence of neboviruses and NoVsGIII in China for the first time, and supported the presence of a novel “DijonA216-like” nebovirus genotype.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
