However, nucleocapsid (N) protein of two arteriviruses, porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus and equine arteritis virus, has been observed to localize in the nucleus and nucleolus of virus-infected and N-gene-transfected cells in addition to their normal cytoplasmic distribution. In the present study, the N protein of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice was examined for nuclear localization. The subcellular localization of LDV-N was determined by tagging N with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) at the N- and C-terminus. Both N-EGFP and EGFP-N fusion proteins localized to the nucleus and nucleolus of gene-transfected cells. Labeled N also accumulated in the perinuclear region, the site of virus replication. The LDV-N sequence contains a putative ‘pat4’-type nuclear localization signal (NLS) consisting of 38-KKKK. To determine its functional significance, a series of deletion constructs of N were generated and individually expressed in cells. The results showed that the ‘pat4’ NLS was essential for nuclear translocation. In addition, the LDV-N interacted with the importin-α and -β proteins, suggesting that the LDV-N nuclear localization may occur via the importin-mediated nuclear transport pathway. These results provide further evidence for the nuclear localization of N as a common feature within the arteriviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
