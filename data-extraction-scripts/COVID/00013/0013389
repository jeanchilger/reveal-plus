<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1993</DATELINE><TITLE>Necrotizing enterocolitis: A continuing problem in the neonate</TITLE><BODY>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a syndrome of diverse etiologies with a significant mortality rate affecting mostly prematurely born stressed infants. Now recognized as a discrete entity, it had been poorly defined because other conditions seem to represent the same entity. A number of risk factors have been identified that appear to “trigger” NEC, though these have been questioned because they have been present just as frequently in premature and older infants who did not develop NEC as in those that did. Recently, maternal cocaine use has been added to the suspected risk factors. A steady improvement in the survival of babies with NEC has been due largely to a high index of suspicion of the disease and early, aggressive medical management.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
