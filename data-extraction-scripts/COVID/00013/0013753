<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Appropriate Use and Future Directions of Molecular Diagnostic Testing</TITLE><BODY>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Major technologic advances in two main areas of molecular infectious disease diagnostics have resulted in accelerated adoption or ordering, outpacing implementation, and clinical utility studies. Physicians must understand the limitations to and appropriate utilization of these technologies in order to provide cost-effective and well-informed care for their patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Rapid molecular testing and, to a lesser degree, clinical metagenomics are now being routinely used in clinical practice. While these tests allow for a breadth of interrogation not possible with conventional microbiology, they pose new challenges for diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship programs. This review will summarize the most recent literature on these two categories of technologic advances and discuss the few studies that have looked at utilization and stewardship approaches. This review also highlights the future directions for both of these technologies. SUMMARY: The appropriate utilization of rapid molecular testing and clinical metagenomics has not been well established. More studies are needed to assess their prospective impacts on patient management and antimicrobial stewardship efforts as the future state of infectious disease diagnostics will see continued expansion of these technologic advances.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
