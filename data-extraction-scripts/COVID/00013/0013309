<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-04-17</DATELINE><TITLE>Complete genomic sequence of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus SHXB isolated in China</TITLE><BODY>A strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), SHXB, was isolated in Shanghai, China. The complete genome of strain SHXB was sequenced, and its sequence was compared those of other TGEV strains in the GenBank database. The comparison showed that there were no insertions or deletions in the 5′ and 3′- non-translated regions, in the nonstructural genes ORF1, ORF3, and ORF7, or in the genes encoding the structural proteins envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N). A phenomenon in common with other strains was that nucleotide (nt) 655 of the spike (S) gene was G, and a common change in nt 1753 of the S gene was a T-to-G mutation that caused a serine-to-alanine mutation at amino acid 585, which is in the region of the main major antigenic sites A and B of the TGEV S protein. A 6-nt deletion was also found at nt 1123-1128 in all Purdue strains except the strain Virulent Purdue. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TGEV SHXB was closely related to the Purdue strains and shared a common ancestor with the Miller strains as well as strain PRCV-ISU-1.
