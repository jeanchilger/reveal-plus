In the present study, the full-length genome sequence from a PEDV isolate (CH/HNQX-3/14) was determined. The complete genome sequence analysis showed that the CH/HNQX-3/14 possessed unique deletion regions in the S and ORF3 genes. It was identified as a recombinant strain using phylogenetic analysis and recombination detection program. Further analyses of the full-length sequence suggest that CH/HNQX-3/14 is a natural recombinant between the attenuated vaccine strains (CV777 and DR13) and circulating wild-type strain (CH/ZMDZY/11). The recombination occurred not only in structural protein-coding region (S1 and N genes) but also in non-structural protein-coding region (replicases 1a and ORF3 genes). These results provided new evidence that PEDV strains circulating in China underwent recombination between vaccine and field strains, suggesting that recombination contributes to the genetic diversity of PEDV. Our findings provide valuable information on PEDV evolution and underscore the need for ongoing surveillance of this economically important swine disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
