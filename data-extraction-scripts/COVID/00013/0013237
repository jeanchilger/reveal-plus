Piglets were immunized with cells infected with the recombinant viruses. Each of the recombinants induced TGEV-specific antibodies detected in a fixed cell enzyme immunoassay. The amino terminal half of the S protein, containing all four major antigenic sites (A, B, C and D), and encoded by a 2.2 kb fragment of the S gene, induced virus neutralizing (VN) antibody titers comparable with those induced by the complete S protein. Recombinant proteins lacking the A antigenic site, or with a deletion including the putative receptor binding sites and the D antigenic site, were not capable of inducing levels of VN antibodies similar to those induced by the whole S protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
