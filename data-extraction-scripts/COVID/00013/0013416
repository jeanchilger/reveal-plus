Our goal was to assess the epidemiology and the potential clinical impact of respiratory viral infections in a high-risk patient population. Two large hospitals performed a respiratory Taqman array card (TAC), targeting 24 viruses, 8 bacteria, and 2 fungi simultaneously, on 435 samples from 397 symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Clinical details were collected retrospectively using a structured case report form. An overall positivity rate of 68% was found (51% mono- and 17% co-infections). Pathogen distribution was as follows: influenza A (20.7%), rhinoviruses (15.2%), coronaviruses (7.8%), Pneumocystis jirovecii (7.4%), RSV (7.1%), and CMV (6.0%) were the most frequently encountered, followed by HSV (5.5%), hMPV (4.4%), parainfluenza viruses (3.9%), influenza B (3.7%), and Aspergillus species (3.7%). Other pathogens were not detected or detected only in ≤ 1% of samples. Hospital and ICU admission rates were 84% and 11%, respectively. The presence of a pathogen was strongly associated with higher need for supplemental oxygen (p = 0.001), but it had no impact on ICU admission, mechanical ventilation requirement, antibacterial therapy, or mortality. In conclusion, our study described the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens in a large group of symptomatic immunocompromised patients and provides evidence of a relationship between pathogen detection and the need for supplemental oxygen. This association was still found after the exclusion of the results positive for influenza viruses, suggesting that non-influenza viruses contribute to severe respiratory illness in patients with compromised immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
