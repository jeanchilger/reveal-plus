The clinical characteristics are high fever, rapidly progressive diffuse pneumonitis and respiratory distress. It is highly infectious through intimate contact or direct contact with infectious body fluids. Outbreaks within communities and hospitals have been reported. Development of rapid and reliable diagnostic tools is urgently needed. We developed an immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using whole virus antigen of SARS-CoV. Eighty-six serum samples collected from patients who were hospitalized for other causes were examined to determine the cut-off O.D. value. The cut-off O.D. value was defined as 0.175 by calculating the mean O.D. value of the 86 sera plus 3 standard deviations. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA, 56 positive sera and 204 negative sera were tested. The sensitivity was 96.4% and the specificity was 100%. The results suggest that the IgG ELISA using whole virus antigen of SARS-CoV has a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting SARS IgG antibodies. This IgG ELISA is a powerful tool for serodiagnosis of SARS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
