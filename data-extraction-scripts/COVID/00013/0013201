We collected rectal swabs from dogs with or without diarrhea symptoms in Japan and examined the feces for the presence of CAstV by RT-PCR with primers based on a conserved region of the ORF1b gene. The ORF1b gene of CAstV was not detected in the 42 dogs without clinical illness but was present in three pups out of the 31 dogs with diarrhea symptoms. Based on the full-length capsid protein, the CAstV KU-D4-12 strain that we detected in this study shared high homology with the novel virulent CAstV VM-2011 strain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
