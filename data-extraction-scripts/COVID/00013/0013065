However, problems with the supply and cost of MK cells and the presence of endogenous viruses, including herpes B virus and SV-5, necessitated a search for an alternative cell line. Continuous cell cultures of human origin (L132, A-549, HuT-292, HEK, G-293, G-401, A-498, A-704, CAKI-1, RD) and simian origin (LLC-MK2, BSC-1, MA-104, Vero) were evaluated for their capacity to support the growth of the human paramyxoviruses, as followed by cytopathic effect, hemadsorption, hemagglutination, and EIA. NCI-H292 (HuT-292) human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells (ATCC # CRL-1848) proved to be the most sensitive line for cultivating all serotypes and strains of the paramyxoviruses. These cells were also shown to be a suitable substitute for MK in primary isolation of paramyxoviruses from clinical specimens. RPMI-1640 with 1.5µg/ml trypsin was the preferred maintenance medium; alternatively, Eagle's MEM supplemented with 1.5µg/ml trypsin and 0.1% ITS was satisfactory. NCI-H292 cells are a continuous line with excellent growth characteristics, although the genetic polyploidy of the cells may limit the number of passages of usable cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
