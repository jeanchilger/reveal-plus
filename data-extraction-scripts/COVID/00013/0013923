In this study, the molecular cloning, expression, and antiporcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) activity of porcine IFN-λ3 (poIFN-λ3) were reported. The full-length poIFN-λ3 cDNA sequence encoded 196 amino acids with a 23 amino acid signal peptide. Sequence alignments showed that poIFN-λ3 had an amino acid sequence similarity to Ovis aries (78.1 %), Bos taurus (76.0 %), Tupaia belangeri (71.3 %), Equus caballus (69.9 %), and Homo sapiens (69.9 %). The phylogenetic analysis based on the genomic sequences indicated that poIFN-λ3 is located in the same branch as B. taurus and O. aries IFN-λ3. The poIFN-λ3 without a signal anchor sequence was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant poIFN-λ3 exhibited significant antiviral effects against PEDV in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect of poIFN-λ3 on PEDV was observed under three different treatment conditions. The highest inhibition of PEDV was observed in Vero E6 cell cultures pretreated with poIFN-λ3 (prior to PEDV infection). In addition, poIFN-λ3 was able to induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, including ISG15, OAS1, and Mx1 in Vero E6 cells. These data demonstrate that poIFN-λ3 has antiviral activity against PEDV and may serve as a useful biotherapeutic candidate to inhibit PEDV or other viruses in swine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
