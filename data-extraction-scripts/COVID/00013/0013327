The chicks were vaccinated against IBV on the second day of life with the vaccine Ma5, but at the age of 18 days, they exhibited clinical signs and macroscopic lesions compatible with avian infectious bronchitis (IB). In the clinical disease stage, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the trachea, lungs, and small intestine of the chicks, while IBV variants were detected in the bursa of Fabricius and kidneys. Subsequently, new samples were collected from the same batch at the end of the production cycle. In this phase, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the kidneys, small intestine, and oviduct of the hens. However, a previously unidentified IBV variant was found in the cecal tonsils. Additionally, a fragment of viral RNA with that was completely identical to the corresponding region of the Ma5 vaccine was detected in the allantoic fluid of viable embryos from the hens under study after 18 days of incubation. These findings suggest that, in addition to the Ma5 vaccine, other strains of IBV variants can coexist, seeming to establish a chronic infection in the chickens, and that they can potentially be transmitted vertically. These results may assist in immunoprophylaxis control programs against IBV.
