The H(III) mice, when compared to their L(III) mice counterparts, were susceptible to MHV3 infection showing higher virus titres in the liver and peritoneal exudate, comparable IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma titres in the peritoneal exudate or in the serum, and higher levels of PCA of PEC and SC. A higher virus titre was detected in the supernatants of H(III) mouse macrophages infected with MHV3. The activation of H(III) mouse macrophages with LPS, IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma, in contrast to that of L(III) mouse macrophages, did not induce an antiviral effect with partial restriction of the MHV3 replication. The LPS antiviral activity was shown to be partially exerted by IFN alpha/beta synthesis. The IFN gamma was shown to be more effective in inducing an antiviral state in L(III) macrophages, when compared to IFN alpha/beta. The data obtained are consistent with the notion that the resistance mechanisms to the MHV3 infection involve the PCA and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
