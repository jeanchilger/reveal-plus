<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1993</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral evolution and insects as a possible virologic turning table</TITLE><BODY>Three lines of observation demonstrate the role of arthropods in transmission and evolution of viruses. a) Recent outbreaks of viruses from their niches took place and insects have played a major role in propagating the viruses. b) Examination of the list of viral families and their hosts shows that many infect invertebrates (I) and vertebrates (V) or (I) and plants (P) or all kingdoms (VIPs). This notion holds true irrespective of the genome type. At first glance the argument seems to be weak in the case of enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses with single-stranded (ss) segmented or non-segmented genomes of positive (+) or negative polarity. Here, there are several families infecting V or P only; no systematic relation to arthropods is found. c) In the non-enveloped plant viruses with ss RNA genomes there is a strong tendency for segmentation and individual packaging of the genome pieces. This is in contrast to ss+ RNA animal viruses and can only be explained by massive transmission by seed or insects or both, because individual packaging necessitates a multihit infection. Comparisons demonstrate relationships in the nonstructural proteins of double-stranded and ss+ RNA viruses irrespective of host range, segmentation, and envelope. Similar conclusions apply for the negative-stranded RNA viruses. Thus, viral supergroups can be created that infect V or P and exploit arthropods for infection or transmission or both. Examples of such relationships and explanations for viral evolution are reviewed and the arthropod orders important for cell culture are given.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
