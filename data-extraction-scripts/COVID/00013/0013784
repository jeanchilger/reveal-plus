In this study, we use the amino-acid pair predictability to convert α-galactosidase A with its 137 mutations into scalar sequences, and analyse which amino-acid pairs are more sensitive to mutation. Our results show that the unpredictable amino-acid pairs are more sensitive to mutation, and the mutation trend is to narrow the difference between predicted and actual frequency of amino-acid pairs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
