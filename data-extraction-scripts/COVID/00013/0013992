<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004</DATELINE><TITLE>On the Use of Post-Transcriptional Processing Elements in Transgenes</TITLE><BODY>RNA processing events modulate final productivity of a given transgene. We have evaluated a series of RNA elements for their ability to enhance α1-antitrypsin production in mammary cells. Our results indicate the need for a case-by-case assessment of each construct design and the occurrence of gene silencing events in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
