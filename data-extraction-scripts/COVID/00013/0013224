Two BCV S gene-specific probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction from the avirulent L9-strain of BCV. Probes were located in the S1 and the S2 region of the peplomeric (S) glycoprotein gene. The S1 probe (726 bp) hybridized with BCV and HCV-OC43, but not with HEV under moderate stringency hybridization conditions (50 °C). Only slight signals were present with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and no signals were observed with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) or canine coronavirus (CCV). At high stringency conditions (60 °C) the S1 probe hybridized with BCV only. Using the S2 probe (680 bp) under moderate strin-gency conditions, hybridization signals were obtained with BCV, HCV-OC43 and HEV (strains 67N, NT9, VW572). The signals obtained by the three HEV strains were altogether weaker than with BCV and HCV-OC43. The S2 probe did not react with MHV, FIPV and CCV. At high stringency the S2-specific probe hybridized with BCV and HCV-OC43 but did not hybridize with HEV. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the region covering the S2 probe in HEV revealed 92.6% nucleotide sequence homology to BCV and 91.9% to HCV-OC43. In contrast, the region covering the S1 probe in HEV could not be amplified using the BCV S1-specific primers. The hybridization and sequencing results thus indicate a closer genomic relationship between BCV and HCV-OC43 than there is between HEV and BCV or HCV-OC43, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
