In humans, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus have been found to cause retinal disease. Most of the studied viruses are neurotropic. In this study, the in vitro susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEC) to representative members of different groups of human pathogenic viruses was investigated. • METHODS: Early cultures of RPE C — after two or three passages — were infected with the following viruses: herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus types 1 and 7, measles virus, parainfluenza virus and coxsackie virus B3. • RESULTS: Cultures of RPE C could be infected with neurotropic viruses like HSV or measles virus as well as with typical respiratory viruses like parainfluenza or adenoviruses. Coxsackievirus, an enterovirus, replicated as well as human CMV whereas EBV and HHV-6, two lymphotropic viruses, failed to infect RPE. • CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a variety of viruses, including those causing rather common illnesses, might be capable of inducing retinal lesions under certain circumstances due to haematogenous spread during the course of viraemia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
