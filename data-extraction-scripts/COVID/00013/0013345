<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1987</DATELINE><TITLE>Physico-chemical properties of murine hepatitis virus, strain A59</TITLE><BODY>The infectivity of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) was optimally stable at pH 6.0 and was unaffected by ionic strength or at least 15 cycles of freezing and thawing. It was completely inactivated within 25 minutes at 56° C, but was protected by 1m magnesium chloride or magnesium sulphate. It was completely inactivated within 14 days at 37 and 22°C, but was relatively stable for as long as 72 days at 4°C and optimal pH.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
