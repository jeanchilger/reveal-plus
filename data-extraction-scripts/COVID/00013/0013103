The mechanism of NF-κB signalling and its role in replication of EAV have not been investigated. We demonstrate that EAV infection in BHK-21 cells activates NF-κB, and this activation was found to be mediated through the MyD88 pathway. Infection of IKKβ(−/−) murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), which are deficient in NF-κB signalling, resulted in lower virus titre, less cytopathic effect, and reduced expression of viral proteins. These findings implicate the MyD88 pathway in EAV-induced NF-κB activation and suggest that NF-κB activation is essential for efficient replication of EAV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
