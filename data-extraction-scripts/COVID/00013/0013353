METHODS: Within PID-ARI.net, a research network for ARI in children in Germany, an active, year-round surveillance system was formed in three regions from north to south for population-based analysis. Children from birth to 16 years of age were included and up to 19 noncolonizing airway pathogens were tested for with multiplex RT-PCR. RESULTS: In the 10-year period from July 1996 to June 2006, a total of 18,899 samples were tested. The positive rate increased with the size of the test panel to up to 72.9%. Picornaviruses (35–39%), paramyxoviruses (23–28%) and orthomyxoviruses (5.8–12.5%) comprised the highest fraction. Reoviruses and Legionella pneumophila were not found at all and Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella parapertussis only rarely. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 were anticyclical in rhythmicity with metapneumovirus and PIV1 and PIV2. The age medians per pathogen depended predominantly upon the attack rate and interepidemic intervals. CONCLUSION: Active surveillance systems for ARI are superior to passive systems. They should be pathogen-specific and comprehensive for viruses and bacteria and age ranges. They should be population-based and multilevel to avoid bias. The impact of atypical bacteria in children was highly overestimated in earlier studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
