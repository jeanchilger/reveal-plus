Analysis of various cell-cycle-regulatory proteins indicated that the levels of cyclins A2, B1, and E1 were increased in HHV-6-infected cells, but there was no difference in cyclin D1 levels between mock-infected and HHV-6-infected cells. Our data also showed that inducing G2/M phase arrest in cells infected by HHV-6 provided favorable conditions for viral replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
