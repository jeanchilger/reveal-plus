<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-08-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Molecular characterization of an infectious bronchitis virus strain isolated from northern China in 2012</TITLE><BODY>This study reports the complete genome sequence of an infectious bronchitis virus (CK/CH/SD/121220, KJ128295) isolated in 2012 from Shandong Province in northern China. The genome is 27,666 nt long, comprising six genes and 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions. The full-length genome of the CK/CH/SD/121220 isolate had the highest nucleotide sequence identity (96.7 %) to the YX10 strain. Sites of recombination were identified in the genes 1ab, S, 5a, 5b and N, with their putative parental strains belonging to the QX- and YN-type subgroups, which are already circulating in China. Our findings suggest an important role played by recombination in IBV evolution.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
