Beneath Vero E6 cells SARS- Coronavirus infection could also be demonstrated in two pig cell lines (POEK, PS) and one human cell line (Huh-7) using the indirect immunofluorescence assay and a newly established quantitative real-time PCR. In all susceptible cell lines mRNA of the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV infection, could be detected by RT-PCR. Our results show that there is a correlation between the abundance of ACE2 mRNA and SARS-CoV susceptibility.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
