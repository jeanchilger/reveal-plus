Recombinant 3CL(pro) was expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 as a 42 kDa protein that displayed a K (m) of 15 ± 2 μM with Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans as substrate. Purified 3CL(pro) was used for inhibition and kinetic assays with seven flavonoid compounds. The IC(50) of six flavonoid compounds were 47–381 μM. Quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate and gallocatechin gallate (GCG) displayed good inhibition toward 3CL(pro) with IC(50) values of 73, 73 and 47 μM, respectively. GCG showed a competitive inhibition pattern with K (i) value of 25 ± 1.7 μM. In molecular docking experiments, GCG displayed a binding energy of −14 kcal mol(−1) to the active site of 3CL(pro) and the galloyl moiety at 3-OH position was required for 3CL(pro) inhibition activity.
