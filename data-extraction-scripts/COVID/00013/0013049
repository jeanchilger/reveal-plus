The primary translation product, deduced from the DNA sequence, is a polypeptide of 225 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 26,000. The polypeptide has 3 potential N-glycosylation sites. Many structural similarities with the membrane proteins of other coronaviruses can be recognized.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
