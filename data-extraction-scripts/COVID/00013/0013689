Serodiagnostic methods, typically ELISA (with either native or recombinant antigens), are often used for early diagnosis. The use of native antigens, as in the MM3-SERO ELISA (commercialized as BIO K 211, BIO-X Diagnostics), continues to be beneficial in terms of sensitivity and specificity; however, there is interest in developing ELISA tests based on recombinant antigens to avoid the need to culture parasites. Of the antigens secreted by adult flukes, recombinant procathepsin L1 (rFhpCL1) is the most commonly tested in ELISA to date. However, although adult flukes produce three different clades of CLs (FhCL1, FhCL2, and FhCL5), to our knowledge, the diagnostic value of recombinant FhCL2 and FhCL5 has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we developed and tested three indirect ELISAs using rFhpCL1, rFhpCL2, and rFhpCL5 and evaluated their recognition by sera from sheep and cattle naturally infected with F. hepatica. Although the overall antibody response to these three rFhpCLs was similar, some animals displayed preferential recognition for particular rFhpCLs. Moreover, for cattle sera, the highest sensitivity was obtained using rFhpCL2 (97%), being equal for both rFhpCL1 and rFhpCL5 (87.9%), after adjusting cut-offs for maximum specificity. By contrast, for sheep sera, the sensitivity was 100% for the three rFhpCLs. Finally, the presence of truncated and/or partially unfolded molecules in antigen preparations is postulated as a possible source of cross-reactivity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
