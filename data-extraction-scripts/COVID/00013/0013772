The receptor-like protein was identified by exploiting the molecular mimicry potential of anti-idiotypic antibodies. A single-chain Fv molecule derived from the monoclonal antibody 7A (Mab-7A), which recognizes the CP of TuMV, was produced in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein was used to raise rabbit antibodies. The immune serum reacted with Mab-7A but not with a monoclonal antibody of the same isotype, indicating that anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced. These anti-idiotypic antibodies recognized a 37 kDa protein from Lactuca sativa. Complex formation between the anti-idiotypic antibodies and the plant protein was inhibited by the CP of TuMV which indicates that the plant protein interacts with the viral protein. The 37 kDa protein was localized in chloroplasts and was detected in other plant species.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
