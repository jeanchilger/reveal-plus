Endemic strains of PEDV were isolated from different areas, and the complete genome sequences of 10 isolates were determined. Our objective in this study was to genetically characterize current Chinese field isolates of PEDV to better understand their epidemiology and genetic diversity. Sequence analysis showed that 10 post-2010 isolates shared high homology with each other and were always clustered together with the virulent DR13 strains (South Korea) and/or one earlier Chinese strain, CH-S, in phylogenetic analysis. All post-2010 isolates possessed common sequence changes in each gene. Our results suggest that current Chinese PEDV isolates originated from either South Korean and/or Chinese ancestors that underwent some genetic variation, thereby forming a new PEDV genotype in China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
