The objective of this study was to assess Griffithsin’s inhibitory effect on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The results showed that Griffithsin reduced PEDV infection of Vero cells by approximately 82.8%. Moreover, using time-of-addition assays and RT-qPCR, we found that delayed addition of Griffithsin had a weaker inhibitory effect on PEDV than earlier treatment. The mechanism of Griffithsin’s action against PEDV involved both preventing viral attachment to host cells and disrupting cell-to-cell transmission; its dual mode of action distinguished Griffithsin from most other antiviral drugs. In conclusion, Griffithsin was identified as a potent PEDV inhibitor and may represent a candidate drug for preventing PEDV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
