From 1st July 2009 until 20th September 2009, an observational study including all pregnant women presenting at Hospital Universitario La Paz with an ILI was carried out. A specific reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for nH1N1 in nasopharyngeal swabs was prospectively carried out in all patients. Retrospectively, samples were analysed for multiple respiratory virus panel (RT-PCR microarray). Clinical, demographical and other microbiological variables were evaluated as well. A total of 45 pregnant women with ILI were admitted. Of these, 14 (31.1%) women had nH1N1 infection and 11 with a non-influenza ILI (35.48%) were positive for other viruses (five rhinovirus, four parainfluenza virus, one bocavirus and one adenovirus). In 20 patients, no aetiologic agent was identified. The clinical course of nH1N1 was mild, without deaths or severe complications. No significant differences were found when comparing the clinical presentation and course of patients with and without nH1N1 infection. Six women with nH1N1 infection received oseltamivir. Influenza and non-influenza ILI were clinically indistinguishable among pregnant women. Many ILI in pregnant women remain undiagnosed, despite undergoing an RT-PCR microarray for several respiratory viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
