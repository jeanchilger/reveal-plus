Moreover, a novel PBoV (tentatively named PBoV3C) with a nearly complete genome sequence (5235 bp) was identified. PBoV3C exhibits typical genome characteristics of bocaviruses and shows the highest genomic sequence identity (78 % to 81 %) to PBoV3A/B (PBoV3/4-UK) and PBoV3D/E (PBoV3/4-HK), respectively. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis indicated high diversity, prevalence and complexity among the PBoVs. The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) site of VP1 and the secondary structure of VP2 of PBoV3C were also analyzed. Additionally, we propose a uniform method of PBoV nomenclature based on the VP1 gene.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
