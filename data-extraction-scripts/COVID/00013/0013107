<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-11-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Human bocavirus in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia</TITLE><BODY>A new human parvovirus, human bocavirus, has recently been identified in respiratory secretions, feces and serum. It is associated with lower and most likely also upper respiratory tract infections. Most commonly reported symptoms are cough, rhinorrhea, expiratory wheezing and fever, and the virus is preferentially detected in young children. We report three children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had acute febrile episodes with concomitant detection of human bocavirus in their respiratory secretions. One of them had five consecutive febrile episodes during 6 months, all associated with the presence of human bocavirus at varying viral loads, suggesting prolonged shedding or reactivation of the virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
