Impurity is one of the main factors affecting vaccine safety and efficacy. Here we present a novel innovative PRRSV purification approach based on surface display technology. First, a bifunctional protein PA-GRFT (protein anchor-griffithsin), the crucial factor in the purification process, was successfully produced in Escherichia coli yielding 80 mg/L of broth culture. Then PRRSV purification was performed by incubation of PA-GRFT with PRRSV and gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles, followed by centrifugation to collect virions loaded onto GEM particles. Our results showed that most of the bulk impurities had been removed, and PA-GRFT could capture PRRSV onto GEM particles. Our lactic acid bacteria-based purification method, which is promising as ease of operation, low cost and easy to scale-up, may represent a candidate method for the large-scale purification of this virus for vaccine production.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
