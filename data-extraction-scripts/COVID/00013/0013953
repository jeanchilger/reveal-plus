S1 glycoprotein genes of these strains were sequenced and analyzed with 38 strains published in GenBank. S1 genes of these isolated strains and the vaccine strains showed nucleotide homologies ranging from 65.2 to 82% and amino acid homologies ranging from 58.4 to 81.9%. Meanwhile, Chinese IBV strains isolated in this study, which were mainly nephropathogenic, could be separated into six variant lineages (CH I–CH VI), and current vaccine strains used in China formed Mass variant lineage that is evolutionarily distant from Chinese isolates. Moreover, CK/CH/GD/NC10, CK/CH/GD/KP10, and our previous isolates TC07-2 formed the CH VI lineage, showing larger evolutionary distances from other strains. Taken together, these findings suggested that various variant lineages were co-circulating in China now, and appeared to be continuously evolving, alternative indigenous vaccines indeed need for effective control of IB in China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
