Antiviral genes (encoding antisense RNA or viral protein) derived from Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were efficiently targeted into CD4+ lymphocytes through retroviral-mediated gene transfer. After challenging with infectious viruses, the transduced lymphocytes that received antiviral genes were not only protected from SIV infection, but also from infection with HIV, for at least 25 days. Furthermore, little or no cytolytic effect (syncytium formation) was observed in the protected cells. These data demonstrated that SIV or HIV replication could be effectively blocked by antisense sequence(s) or negative dominant factors which were introduced into targeted cells through retroviral-mediated gene transfer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
