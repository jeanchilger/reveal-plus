To assess the concomitant inflammatory reaction in an extracerebral site, livers were examined in parallel. Mice were infected i.v. withCryptococcus neoformans, group A/D, and organs were examined immunohistologically for CD4-, CD8- and monocyteand granulocyte-specific CD11b-phenotypic leukocytes over a period of 60 days. Intracerebrally, agglomerations of cryptococci formed pseudocysts that were surrounded by CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes at the end of the second week post-infection, followed by the invasion of monocytes and granulocytes into the lesions. After the fourth week post-infection, most of the invaded lesions were transformed into glious scars. Meningitis was usually marked and showed a homogenous distribution of CD4-, CD8- and CD11b-phenotypic cells, with a predominance of monocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes. Inflammatory infiltrates in the liver were found already 4 days post-infection. CD4+ lymphocytes and monocytes were distributed homogenously in the infiltrates, with a lower number of CD8+ lymphocytes being located rather in the periphery of the infiltrates. Comparing leukocyte kinetics in brain and liver, an important observation was the delayed immigration of immune cells at the intracerebral cryptococcal lesions as compared with the liver, and the different migration patterns of T-lymphocyte subgroups and macrophages. These results suggest that there are differential leukocyte migration patterns in the liver and brain following disseminated cryptococcosis. The immunological aspects of the observed leukocyte kinetics are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
