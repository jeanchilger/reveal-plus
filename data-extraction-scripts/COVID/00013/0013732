Therefore, virological surveillance of animals and particularly great apes is of great interest to establish the repertory of viruses associated with healthy hosts. This will further help to identify the emergence of new viruses and predict the possibility of interspecies transmission. In this study, we performed shotgun viral metagenomics on stool samples collected from seventeen free-living wild gorillas from the Republic of the Congo. The analysis revealed the presence of novel RNA viruses (picobirnaviruses, partitivirus, and Picornavirales (posa-like and dicistrovirus-like viruses)). Among these, picobirnavirus-related sequences were abundantly covered in the stools. Based on genetic variations both in capsid and RdRp proteins of picobirnaviruses, at least 96 variants were identified and most of them were novel. Among the 96, 22 variants had a nearly complete genome or segment. A comprehensive sequence analysis identified a potential new genogroup/genetic cluster and the presence of a short linear amino acid motif (ExxRxNxxxE) in a hypothetical protein. The sequence analysis of posa-like virus and dicistrovirus showed that these two viruses were novel members in the respective viral families. In conclusion, the identification of novel RNA viruses and their genetic diversity increases our knowledge about viruses that are associated with stools of wild gorillas and contributes to the initiatives in the search for potential emerging zoonotic viruses.
