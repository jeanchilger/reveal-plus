In this study, we further maintained the 83P-5 in Vero cells up to the 100th passage and analyzed changes in the spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences and pathogenicity of the virus at the 34th, 61st, and 100th passage levels. Sequence analyses revealed a strong selection for the S gene of 83P-5 in Vero cells, and virtually all mutations occurring at the 34th and 61st passages had been carried over to the 100th-passaged virus. In contrast, the viral M and N genes showed a strong conservation during the serial passage. Pigs experimentally infected with the 34th- or 61st-passaged virus, but not the 100th-passaged virus, exhibited diarrhea, indicating an attenuation of the 83P-5 at the 100th passage. Interestingly, S protein of the attenuated 100th-passaged 83P-5 showed a remarkable sequence similarity to that of previously reported DR-13 strain of attenuated PEDV that also had been established by serial passage in Vero cells. Further studies will be required to define whether the mutations in the S gene of 83P-5 that had been selected and accumulated during the serial passages are indeed the causalities of the growth adaptation in vitro and the attenuation of virulence in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
