<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-05-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Assembly of HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins into coronavirus VLPs</TITLE><BODY>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is believed to assemble by budding into membranes of the early secretory pathway, consistent with the membrane location where the viral envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 accumulate when expressed. Coronavirus assembly also takes place at pre-Golgi membranes. Here, we generated coronavirus-like particles carrying in their envelope chimeric HCV glycoproteins composed of the ectodomains of E1 and E2, each fused to the transmembrane plus endodomain of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus spike glycoprotein. The chimeric particle system will enable structural and functional studies of the HCV glycoproteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
