The expression of CD31, CD61, CD62p, CD63 and PAC-1 on platelet membrane was measured respectively by flowcytometry, and the plasma prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT) and fibrinogen (Fbg) were measured by blood clotting instrument in 26 patients with ANFH after SARS and in 17 healthy adults. The expression of CD31, CD61, CD 62p, CD63 and PAC-1 on platelet membrane in 26 patients was all lower than that in 17 healthy subjects (P < 0.01). The levels of PT, APTT, TT and Fbg in 26 patients were all normal. There is no significant difference (P > 0.05) in those markers between patients and 17 healthy adults. The blood may not be in hypercoagulable state in patients with ANFH after SARS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
