<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-09-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Novel single-stranded, circular DNA virus identified in cats in Japan</TITLE><BODY>We detected a novel feline stool-associated circular DNA virus (FeSCV) in fecal samples from cats with diarrhea using consensus primers matching those of circovirus and cyclovirus. FeSCV is a circular DNA virus containing a genome with a total length of 2,046 nt encoding 2 open reading frames. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that FeSCV is classified into a clade different from that of circovirus and cyclovirus. Since the FeSCVs detected in several cats in the same household had genetically similar genomes, these viruses are most likely derived from the same origin.
