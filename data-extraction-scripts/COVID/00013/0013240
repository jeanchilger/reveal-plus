We identified amino acids involved in a serotype specific, conformationally dependent epitope by analysis of the S1 gene of 13 monoclonal antibody-neutralization-resistant mutants. Substitutions in the predicted amino acid sequence of these mutants were located at residues 304 and/or 386. Most of the substitutions at residue 304 were from threonine to isoleucine, whereas the substitutions at residue 386 were from arginine to proline, histidine, cysteine, or tryptophan. Based on this data, it appears that AA residues at 304 and 386 on the S1 glycoprotein are involved in a virus neutralizing serotype specific epitope.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
