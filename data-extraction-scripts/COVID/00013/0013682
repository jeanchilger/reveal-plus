The tertiary structure of RNA molecules and RNA–RNA/protein interaction sites are of increasing importance as potential targets for new medicines that treat a broad array of human diseases. Current RNA drugs are split into two groups: antisense RNA molecules and aptamers. In this report, we present a novel workflow to predict RNA tertiary structures and RNA–RNA/protein interactions using the KNIME environment, which enabled us to assemble a combination of RNA-related analytical tools and databases. In this study, three analytical workflows for comprehensive structural analysis of RNA are introduced: (1) prediction of the tertiary structure of RNA; (2) prediction of the structure of RNA–RNA complexes and analysis of their interactions; and (3) prediction of the structure of RNA–protein complexes and analysis of their interactions. In an RNA–protein case study, we modeled the tertiary structure of pegaptanib, an aptamer drug, and performed docking calculations of the pegaptanib-vascular endothelial growth factor complex using a fragment of the interaction site of the aptamer. We also present molecular dynamics simulations of the RNA–protein complex to evaluate the affinity of the complex by mutating bases at the interaction interface. The results provide valuable information for designing novel features of aptamer-protein complexes.
