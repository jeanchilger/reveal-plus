<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-12-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Characterisation of winter respiratory viral infections in patients with asthma and COPD in Qatar</TITLE><BODY>Respiratory viruses in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma have not been characterised in Qatar. This study aimed to identify the most common viral strains responsible for respiratory tract infections in asthma/COPD patients (without exacerbations) in Qatar during the winter season (2008-2009). Nasal swabs from patients with asthma/COPD and respiratory symptoms were evaluated for 15 common viruses. 200 adult patients (190 with asthma and 10 with COPD) were enrolled. Viral infections were present in 36 out of 200 patients (18 %). Cough and wheezing were the most common symptoms. Rhinovirus was the most common causative agent, followed by coronaviruses. Our findings confirm previous reports of rhinovirus prevalence in respiratory tract infections in asthma/COPD. A countrywide survey to confirm our findings is warranted.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
