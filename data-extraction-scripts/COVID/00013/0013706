Almost all of them put stress on analyzing nucleic acid sequences or protein primary sequences. In this paper, we propose a new sequence distance for efficient reconstruction of phylogenetic trees based on the distribution of length about common subsequences between two sequences. We describe some applications of this method, which not only show the validity of the method, but also suggest a number of novel phylogenetic insights.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
