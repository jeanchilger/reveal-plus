Despite the severity of symptoms, therapeutic strategies for this pathologic condition are still poorly developed. Interferon (IFN)-α is well known as an antiviral cytokine and low-dose IFN-α has been reported to show antiinflammatory effects. Therefore, we investigated how this cytokine affected ARDS in a mouse model. C57BL/6 mice received sequential intratracheal administration of α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which resulted in the development of fulminant ARDS. These mice were then treated intranasally with IFN-α and their survival, lung weight, pathological findings, and cytokine production were evaluated. Administration of low-dose IFN-α prolonged survival of fulminant ARDS mice, but higher doses of IFN-α did not. Histological analysis showed that low-dose IFN-α treatment improved findings of diffuse alveolar damage in fulminant ARDS mice, which was associated with reduction in the wet/dry (W/D) lung weight ratio. Furthermore, IFN-γ production in the lungs was significantly reduced in IFN-α-treated mice, compared with control mice, but tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production was almost equivalent for both groups. Low-dose IFN-α shows antiinflammatory and therapeutic effects in a mouse model of fulminant ARDS, and reduced production of IFN-γ in the lung may be involved in the beneficial effect of this treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
