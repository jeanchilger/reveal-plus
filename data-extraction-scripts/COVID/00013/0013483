We reviewed the medical charts of 230 patients hospitalized in one infectious diseases department in France for presumed travel-related illnesses. The male-to-female ratio was 1.6 and the median age was 33 years (interquartile range [IQR], 25–50). Most patients (70.9%) were returning from sub-Saharan Africa. The median duration of travel was 28 days (IQR, 15–60) and the median time from return of travel to hospitalization was 13 days (IQR, 7–21). Malaria was the most frequent diagnosis (49.1%), which was especially encountered in patients returning from sub-Saharan Africa (95.6%), without adequate chemoprophylaxis (78.2%). Imported diseases at risk of secondary transmission were also diagnosed, including pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 8), viral hepatitis (n = 8), typhoid fever (n = 6), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (six new diagnosis), non-typhoid salmonellosis (n = 5), severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. This study underlines the need to maintain tropical expertise for infectious diseases physicians, even in Europe.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
