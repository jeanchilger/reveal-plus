<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1983</DATELINE><TITLE>Pleural effusion disease in rabbits. Properties of the aetiological agent</TITLE><BODY>The size and heat sensitivity of Pleural effusion disease (PED) agent or virus (PEDV) propagated in rabbits were examined. The infectious particles were estimated to be between 25 and 50 nm by filtration. Residual infectivity of infectious serum was 0.1 per cent after heating at 56° C for 4 hours. PEDV and the Stockholm agent appeared identical concerning pathogenic and immunogenic properties by infection experiments and protection tests in rabbits. Two of the three PEDV isolates were less pathogenic but appeared immunogenically identical to PEDV. The third isolate, obtained from the laboratory, which several years previously had supplied material for demonstration of the Stockholm agent, differed from PEDV in pathogenic and immunogenic properties. Serological examinations of paired rabbit sera did not indicate any antigenic relationship between PEDV and representative members of the two mammalian coronavirus antigenic groups. It is concluded that the aetiological agent of PED is a virus not belonging to the coronaviridae.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
