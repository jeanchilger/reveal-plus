The full-length genome was 28,038 nucleotides (nt) in length without the poly (A) tail, and it was similar to that of other reported PEDV strains, with the characteristic gene order 5′-replicase (1a/1b) -S-ORF3-E-M-N-3′. Nucleotide sequence analysis based on individual virus genes indicated a close relationship between the S gene of SHQP/YM/2013 and those of the four Korean field strains from 2008–2009. Its ORF3 gene, however, fell into three groups. Recent prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates were divided between group 1 and group 3, which suggests that the recent prevalent Chinese PEDV field isolates represent a new genotype that differs from the genotype that includes the vaccine strains. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the M gene, ORF3 gene and S gene, our study demonstrated that prevalent PEDV isolates in China may have originated from Korean strains. This report describes the complete genome sequence of SHQP/YM/2013, and the data will promote a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates in eastern China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
