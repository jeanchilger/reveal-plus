The longer phylogenetic branch length to their nearest genetic neighbors indicates that the origin of the novel A/H1N1 is unlikely to be a very recent event. Seventy-six new unique mutations are found to be monomorphically fixed in the novel A/H1N1 virus lineages, suggesting a role of selective sweep in the early evolution of this virus.
