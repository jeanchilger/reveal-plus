During one year, 458 fecal samples were collected from buffalo calves less than 3 month age in 55 small scale herds and examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts. Data describing age, gender, season, and herd management practices were gathered to assess potential risk factors. Fecal examination showed that 14.19% of the examined calves were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. Calves at 1–15 days were at the highest risk (P < 0.001), and a significant relationship between season and infection (P < 0.05) was recorded. A significant association between infection and hygiene (P < 0.001), type of floor (P < 0.01) and source of water (P < 0.01) was also recorded. Statistical analysis concerning the clinical signs and fecal characteristics revealed a significant association with fecal consistency (P < 0.001), presence of blood (P < 0.01) and mucous (P < 0.01). Moreover, a significant association was found between infection and the desire for suckling (P < 0.05) and tenesmus (P < 0.05). The results of the present study demonstrated the strong relation between infections by Cryptosporidium spp. and diarrhea in buffalo calves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
