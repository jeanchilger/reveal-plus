<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-08-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Characterization of avian paramyxovirus type 6 isolated from a Eurasian teal in the intersection of migratory flyways in Russia</TITLE><BODY>The complete genome sequence was determined for avian paramyxovirus (APMV-6) serotype 6 strain teal/Chany/455/2009, isolated from a teal (Anas crecca) in Siberia. Siberia is crossed by four major migration flyways and represents the major breeding area for many wild bird species in the Palearctic. Strain teal/Chany/455/2009 is genetically closely related to Kazakh and Chinese strains and belongs to the genetic group of duck/Hong Kong/18/199/77-like APMV-6 viruses. We show that the virus has low pathogenic potential according to genetic markers and animal model experiments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
