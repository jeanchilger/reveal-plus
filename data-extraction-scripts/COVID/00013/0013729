Here we report nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular modelling studies on the 9-O-acetyl esterase showing that the α-configured Neu5,9Ac(2) is strictly preferred by the INF-C and BCoV esterases. Interestingly, we have discovered that the INF-C esterase function releases acetate independently of the chemical nature of the aglycon moiety, whereas subtle differences in substrate recognition were found for BCoV esterase. Analysis of the apo and complexed X-ray crystal structure of INF-C esterase revealed that binding of 9-O-acetylated N-acetylneuraminic acids is a dynamic process that involves conformational rearrangement of serine-57 in the esterase active site. This study provides valuable insights towards the design of drugs to combat INF-C virus and coronavirus infections causing outbreaks of upper respiratory infections and severe diarrhea in calves, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
