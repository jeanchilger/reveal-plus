But recently, this disease has been witnessed in other regions to a large extent and can become an epidemic very soon. In this paper, a new fog computing based e-Healthcare framework has been proposed to monitor the KFD infected patients in an early phase of infection and control the disease outbreak. For ensuring high prediction rate, a novel Extremal Optimization tuned Neural Network (EO-NN) classification algorithm has been developed using hybridization of the extremal optimization with the feed-forward neural network. Additionally, a location based alert system has also been suggested to provide the global positioning system (GPS)-based location information of each KFD infected user and the risk-prone zones as early as possible to prevent the outbreak. Furthermore, a comparative study of proposed EO-NN with state of art classification algorithms has been carried out and it can be concluded that EO-NN outperforms others with an average accuracy of 91.56%, a sensitivity of 91.53% and a specificity of 97.13% respectively in classification and accurate identification of risk-prone areas.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
