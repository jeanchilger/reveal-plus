<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1991</DATELINE><TITLE>Functional and molecular analysis of mitochondria in thyroid oncocytoma</TITLE><BODY>We report a functional and molecular analysis of nine oncocytic tumors of the human thyroid. In all the abundance of mitochondria observed ultrastructurally was accompanied by an increase in enzymatic activities of respiratory complexes I (NADH dehydrogenase), II (succinate dehydrogenase) IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and V (ATPase). Western blot analysis failed to detect uncoupling protein in the tumors. The elevated respiratory enzyme activities were paralleled by an increase in the mitochondrial DNA content. Restriction analysis of mitochondrial DNA gave no indication of heteroplasmy or other gross alterations. We conclude that the mitochondrial proliferation in oncocytic tumors is probably not the result of a compensatory mechanism for the deficiency in enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
