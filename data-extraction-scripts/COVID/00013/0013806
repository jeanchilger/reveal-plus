In neonates, the infection is non-viremic, have very short incubation period, and manifests profuse diarrhea and severe dehydration. Concurrent infection with secondary pathogens may augment the disease severity. Diarrhea occurs due to virus-mediated destruction of absorption efficient enterocytes, activation of enteric nervous system, or due to a rotavirus enterotoxin. Diagnosis of the infection relies on conventional techniques like isolation in MA 104 cell lines, electron microscopy, electro-pherotyping, and various serological tests. Presently, diagnosis and molecular typing is performed using serotype specific RT-PCR, sequencing or genomic hybridization techniques. As the rotaviruses are known to exhibit extreme genetic diversity and outplay disinfection procedures, eradication of the pathogen is often difficult. Hence, for prevention, good management practices coupled with vaccination of dam for protecting young ones, has to be practiced. Recently, new generation prophylactic strategies including DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs) and edible vaccines have been found to induce sufficient levels of passive immunity. Aside to the infection in animals, zoonotic significance of the animal rotaviruses has to be further unearthed. In this review, efforts have been made to highlight the importance and prevalence of the disease in bovines, its pathogenesis along with preventive measures, salient features of rotaviruses and their inter-species transmission abilities, zoonotic implications, and a concise account of the infection in various domestic animals and poultry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
