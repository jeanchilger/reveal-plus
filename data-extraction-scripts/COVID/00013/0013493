<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-09-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Myoblast transplantation: A possible surgical treatment for a severe pediatric disease</TITLE><BODY>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic X-linked recessive orphan disease that affects approximately 1 in 3 500 male births. Boys with DMD have progressive and predictable muscle destruction due to the absence of dystrophin, a protein present under the muscle fiber membrane. This absence induces contraction-related membrane damage and activation of inflammatory necrosis and fibrosis, leading to cardiac/diaphragmatic failure and death. The authors support the therapeutic role of myoblast transplantation in DMD, and describe the history and rationale for such an approach.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
