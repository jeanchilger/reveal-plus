Five diseased calves from each farm were chosen for examination. Acute and convalescent serum samples were taken from calves with signs of respiratory disease. Sera were analyzed for antibodies to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI-3V), and bovine adenovirus-3 (BAV-3) by indirect ELISA kits. Among 42 serum samples collected at sample 1, seroprevalence values for viruses BHV-1, BVDV, BRSV, PI-3V, and BAV-3 were 61.9% (26), 57.1% (24), 64.2% (27), 90% (38), and 61.9% (26), respectively. Seroconversion to BVDV, BRSV, PI-3V, and BAV-3 occurred in 11.9% (5), 16.6% (7), 26.1% (11), and 21.4% (9) of animals, and 52.3% (22) had generated antibodies against one or more viral infections at sample 2. In addition, no significant relationship between seroprevalence of BHV-1, BVDV, BRSV, PI-3V, and BAV-3 and dairy herd size was observed (P > 0.05). According to serological findings, BHV-1, BVDV, BRSV, PI-3V, and BAV-3 are common pathogens of the dairy calf pneumonia in dairy herds in Mashhad area of Khorasan Razavi province, Iran.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
