Murine fulminant hepatitis was induced in 4-week-old male ICR mice by intraperitoneal inoculation of MHV-2. Mouse interferon (10(3) IU/mouse/day) was intraperitoneally injected every day. Exogenous mouse interferon suppressed both the growth of MHV-2 in the liver tissue and development of liver cell necrosis, and prolonged the survival. It was also found that the earlier mouse interferon was administered, the greater was the prolongation of survival.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
