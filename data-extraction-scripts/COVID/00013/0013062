In this study, we developed a duplex reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (duplex-rtRAA) assay containing an internal control in a single closed tube for the detection of human RSV. The internal control in the amplification effectively eliminated false-negative results and ensured the accuracy of the duplex-rtRAA system. We first developed and evaluated a universal singleplex-rtRAA assay for RSV. The sensitivity of this assay for RSV was determined as 4.4 copies per reaction, and the specificity was 100%. Next, a duplex-rtRAA assay with an internal control was established. The sensitivity of the duplex-rtRAA assay approached 5.0 copies per reaction, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The two detection methods (singleplex-rtRAA and duplex-rtRAA) developed in this study were used to test 278 clinical specimens, and the results showed absolute consistency with RSV RT-qPCR analysis, demonstrating 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. These data indicate that the duplex-rtRAA has great potential for the rapid detection of RSV with a high sensitivity.
