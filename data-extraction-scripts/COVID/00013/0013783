The latter group has been known to yield inconsistent trees if used individually. Our trees are obtained without making any sequence alignment. Altogether 16 Archaea, 105 Bacteria and 2 Eucarya are represented on the tree. Most of the lower branchings agree well with the latest, 2003, Outline of the second edition of the Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology and the trees also suggest some relationships among higher taxa.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
