The results showed that two NO-generating compounds, S-nitroso-l-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and l-arginine (LA), at a noncytotoxic concentration could reduce PPV replication in a dose-dependent manner and that this anti-PPV effect could be reversed by the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME). By assaying the steps of the PPV life cycle, we also show that NO inhibits viral DNA and protein synthesis. This experiment provides a frame of reference for the study of the anti-viral mechanism of NO.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
