<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1993</DATELINE><TITLE>Characterization of monoclonal antibodies to bovine enteric coronavirus and antigenic variability among Quebec isolates</TITLE><BODY>Twenty monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were prepared against the Mebus strain of bovine enteric coronavirus, 14 of them reacting with the peplomeric S (gp 100) glycoprotein. Competition binding assays allowed the definition of at least 4 distinct antigenic domains for the S glycoprotein, designated as A, B, C, and D; epitopes associated to neutralizing activity being located in sites A, B, and C. One MAb directed to the hemagglutinin HE (gp 140/gp 65) glycoprotein inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of the virus, but had no neutralizing activity. Comparison of Quebec enteropathogenic BCV isolates using polyclonal antiserum and MAbs directed to the S glycoprotein confirmed their close antigenic relationship, but also revealed the occurrence of at least three distinct antigenic subgroups. Antigenic domain D was highly conserved among BCV isolates, as well as non-neutralizing epitopes assigned to antigenic domains A and C. The Minnesota strain of turkey enteric coronavirus could be distinguished from BCV isolates by MAbs directed to epitopes of antigenic domain C, whereas human coronavirus HCV-OC 43 could be distinguished by MAbs directed to epitopes of antigenic domain A. The porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus could be distinguished from the other hemagglutinating coronaviruses by neutralizing epitopes located on antigenic domains A, B, and C.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
