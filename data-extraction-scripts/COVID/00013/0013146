<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1980</DATELINE><TITLE>Electron microscopy detection and characterization of viral particles in dog stools</TITLE><BODY>A number of apparently normal dog stool samples, randomly collected on the sidewalks of Paris were examined by Electron Microscopy. The study revealed the presence of viral particles in 27 cases. Morphological criteria lead to the characterization of rotavirus in 2 specimen, coronavirus in 7 and parvovirus in 5. Rotavirus particles appeared always alone while coronavirus and parvovirus particles were present together in 5 cases. Similar particles have been implicated in animal and human gastroenteritis. The importance of their presence in canine dejections is discussed in view of pollution by dog stools of urban and suburban areas.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
