In this study, swine enteric caliciviruses were detected in ten samples of intestinal contents from 24 piglets in Japan by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using a broadly reactive primer pair (P290/289) that targeted the highly conserved RNA polymerase regions of the enteric caliciviruses. From the positive samples, the entire viral genome of strain K7/JP and 3′-end parts of the genomes of strains K5/JP and K10/JP were cloned and sequenced. K7/JP had an RNA genome of 7144 bases, excluding its 3′ poly (A) tail. The K7/JP genome possessed two open reading frames and characteristics common to sapoviruses. In phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences of VP1, K5/JP was demonstrated to be close to the noroviruses previously detected in pigs, and K7/JP and K10/JP were considered to be classified as a new genogroup of sapoviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
