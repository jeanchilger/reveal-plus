In a recent report, proteasome inhibitor MG132 has been shown to completely inhibit IBDV-induced apoptosis. This raises the possibility that the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway may be used by the virus to promote viral replication. In this study, we examined the interplay between IBDV replication and the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway in cultured cells. Treatment of DF-1 cells with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin significantly decreased virus release in the supernatant and prevented virus-induced cytopathic effect. Inhibition of the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway did reduce markedly viral RNA transcription and protein translation but not affect virus internalization. We also demonstrated that IBDV activates caspase pathway via triggering the efflux of cytochrome c in mitochondria into cytosol of infected cells. This activity was dose-dependently reduced by proteasome inhibitor treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that proteasome inhibitor reduces IBDV replication through inhibition of viral RNA transcription and protein synthesis, and thus preventing IBDV-induced apoptosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
