It was then introduced into rice genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A total of 30 regenerated plants with hygromycin resistance were obtained in the selection media. The putative transgenic individuals were tested for the presence of ureB in the nuclear genome of rice plants by PCR analysis. Expression of ureB gene in rice plants was verified by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis using polyclonal human antiserum for transcription and translation levels respectively. These results provide a basis for further studies on the accumulation level of UreB recombinant protein in transgenic rice and potential utilization of transgenic rice for delivery of edible vaccines against Helicobacter pylori.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
