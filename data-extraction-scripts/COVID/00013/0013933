<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-12-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Glial Cell Lines: An Overview</TITLE><BODY>The importance and essential functions of glial cells in the nervous system are now beginning to be understood and appreciated. Glial cell lines have been instrumental in the elucidation of many of these properties. In this Overview, the origin and properties of most of the existing cell lines for the major glial types: oligodendroglia, astroglia, microglia and Schwann cells, are documented. Particular emphasis is given to the culture conditions for each cell line and the degree to which the line can differentiate in vitro and in vivo. The major molecular markers for each glial cell lines are indicated. Finally, methods by which the glial cell lines have been developed are noted and the future directions of glial cell line research are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
