Recent studies show immunomodulation and broad antiviral effects against respiratory tract viruses. Haemagglutinin and Neuraminidase are blocked. In contrast to Oseltamivir no resistance is caused by Echinaforce®. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study over four months confirms that Echinaforce® supports the immune resistance and acts directly against a series of viruses. Echinaforce® is efficacious and safe in respiratory tract infections for long-term and short-term prevention as well as for acute treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
