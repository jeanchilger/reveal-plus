Most of these oligoclonal bands were specific for Borrelia burgdorferi. In patients suffering from chronic meningoradiculomyelitis, repeated CSF examination by this technique showed persistent secretion of identical IgG bands. Thus, the specific humoral immune response and the disease activity could be documented over the course of the disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
