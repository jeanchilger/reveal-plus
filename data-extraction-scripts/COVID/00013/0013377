The present results showed that the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG and anti-HEV IgM in schizophrenia were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Anti-HEV IgG positivity increased with age and with the duration of disease in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, schizophrenia patients with increased CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratios (>2.03) had higher anti-HEV IgG detection rates than those with normal ratios (1.05-2.03). Compared with the schizophrenia patients who tested anti-HEV IgG negative, the levels of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 (Th2 cytokines) were significantly higher, while the interleukin-12 (Th1 cytokine) level was significantly lower, in those with anti-HEV IgG positivity. Of five schizophrenia patients who were anti-HEV IgM positive, four had elevated CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratios. HEV RNA was isolated from one of these four patients and classified as genotype 4. Anti-HEV IgM positivity was not detected among healthy controls. Therefore, schizophrenia patients exhibited a higher risk of HEV infection than controls.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
