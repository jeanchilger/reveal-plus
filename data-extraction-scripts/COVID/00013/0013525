These cells express several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognizing highly conserved microbial motifs and initiating the production of chemokines and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines acting as transmembrane or intracellular receptors. This might not only lead to acute but also to chronic inflammation which is discussed as an underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of different lung diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
