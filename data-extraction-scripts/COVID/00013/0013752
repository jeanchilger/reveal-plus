Knowledge of their causation and pathogenesis is still rudimentary, but many consider than an unconventional agent, the prion (a brain protein, PrP), that is not associated with nucleic acid is involved in both. Others believe that conventional viruses, which replicate by virtue of their nucleic acid-defined genes, are involved in the causation and progression of the encephalopathies but that technical problems have prevented their identification. Others postulate even more exotic causative agents. While this paper will particularly address the possibility of a viral aetiology for these diseases, it is also emphasized that our knowledge of the state of the immune system in animals with encephalopathy needs broadening. There are remarkable gaps in our knowledge of the histopathology of these diseases, particularly the nature of the characteristic vacuoles. Much further work is needed on the biochemical changes in the brain and the serum, particularly of the latter as it could lead to an additional means of recognizing clinical cases without waiting for the animal to die with subsequent examination of the brain for characteristic lesions and the presence of protease-K-resistant PrP.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
