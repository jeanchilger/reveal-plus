An airborne bioaerosol assessment study was carried out at a high traffic density junction focusing on their concentration, contribution in respirable particulate matter (PM), and factors influencing the distribution and microbial diversity. Andersen six-stage viable cascade impactor and a wide-range aerosol spectrometer were used for microbial and particulate matter measurements, respectively. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between bioaerosol concentration, vehicular count, PM concentration, and meteorological parameters. The mean bacteria concentration (1962.95 ± 651.85 CFU/m(3)) was significantly different than fungi (1118.95 ± 428.34 CFU/m(3)) (p < 0.05). The temporal distribution showed maximum concentration for bacteria and fungi during monsoon and postmonsoon seasons, respectively. In terms of bioaerosol loading, a considerable fraction of fungi (3.25%) and bacteria (5.65%) contributed to the total airborne PM. Most abundant bioaerosols were Aspergillus (27.58%), Penicillium (23%), and Cladosporium (14.05%) (fungi), and Micrococcus (25.73%), Staphylococcus (17.98%), and Bacillus (13.8%) (bacteria). Traffic-induced roadside soil resuspension and microbial aerosolizations from the human body were identified as the chief sources of bioaerosol emissions. The risk of lower respiratory tract infections caused by anthroponotic (human transmitted) transfer of bacterial pathogens is very high. The results of the study can be used to trace sources of microbial mediated communicable diseases, and to recommend appropriate safety measures to avoid pathogenic bioaerosol exposure.
