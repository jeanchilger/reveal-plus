Induction of IFN by all of the prototype MHV strains was infrequent and unpredictable, while IFN was produced consistently by five cell lines treated with known inducers. Priming and/or aging of cells did not enhance IFN induction by the MHV strains except in the case of MHV-A59 which consistently induced moderate levels of IFN on L-cells which were both primed and aged. Kinetic studies of MHV-A59-induced IFN on primed and aged L-cells demonstrated that detectable levels of IFN were not produced until 24 hours post-inoculation (p.i.). Peak levels were attained at 30 hours p.i. with no additional IFN produced through 48 hours p.i. MHV-induced IFN was similar in composition and properties to Newcastle disease virus-induced IFN. The sensitivities of the five MHV strains to eight concentrations of preformed L-cell IFN were also assessed. All strains except MHV-S fit a linear model with MHV-3, MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM having similar slopes. At most concentrations MHV-3 was less sensitive than MHV-1, -A59 or -JHM to IFN. The response curve for MHV-S was non-linear. This strain was more sensitive to the antiviral effects of the pre-formed IFN except at the highest concentrations of IFN used.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
