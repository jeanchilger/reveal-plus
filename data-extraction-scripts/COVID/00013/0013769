We identified canine parainfluenza virus 5, canine respiratory coronavirus, carnivore bocaparvovirus 3, canine circovirus and canine papillomavirus 9. Novel canine taupapillomaviruses (CPV21-23) were also identified in 3 dogs and their complete genome sequenced showing L1 nucleotide identity ranging from 68.4 to 70.3% to their closest taupapillomavirus relative. Taupapillomavirus were the only mammalian viral nucleic acids detected in two affected dogs, while a third dog was coinfected with low levels of canine parainfluenza 5. A role for these taupapillomavirues in canine respiratory disease remains to be determined.
