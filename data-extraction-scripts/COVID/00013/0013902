From 25 faecal samples taken from diarrhoeic calves, ten virus isolates were found to give cytopathogenic effects on bovine embryonic kidney cells. Three of the isolates were identified as rotavirus using fluorescent antibody staining, serum-neutralization, complement fixation and agar gel precipitation. The complement fixation test revealed the presence of rotavirus antibodies in 18 of 105 serum samples obtained from other calves slaughtered at Cairo abattoir.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
