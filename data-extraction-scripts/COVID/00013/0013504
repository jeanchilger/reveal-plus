Any of these fluoroquinolones exerts, in parallel to its antibacterial action, antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitic actions at clinically achievable concentrations. This broad range of anti-infective activities is due to one common mode of action, i.e., the inhibition of type II topoisomerases or inhibition of viral helicases, thus maintaining the selective toxicity of fluoroquinolones inhibiting microbial topoisomerases at low concentrations but mammalian topoisomerases at much higher concentrations. Evidence suggests that standard doses of the fluoroquinolones studied are clinically effective against viral and parasitic infections, whereas higher doses administered topically were active against Candida spp. causing ophthalmological infections. Well-designed clinical studies should be performed to substantiate these findings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
