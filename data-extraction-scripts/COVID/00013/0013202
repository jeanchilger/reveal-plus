Partial nucleotide sequences of the S1 spike gene was determined from the PEDV-positive samples and compared with S1 sequences from other countries. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PEDV strains in the Philippines segregate into two groups. Members of group 1 are related to strains from the USA, Taiwan, Japan and Canada, while those in group 2 are related to strains from China and Vietnam.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
