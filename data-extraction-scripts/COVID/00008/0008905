<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-01-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Successful treatment of Providencia rettgeri cholecystitis and neutrophilic cholangitis in a cat</TITLE><BODY>CASE SUMMARY: A 15-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat was presented with a recent history of seizures, diarrhoea, lethargy, fever and jaundice. Marked elevation of liver enzyme activity was present and ultrasound examination was suggestive of cholecystitis and hepatitis. Neutrophilic cholangitis was confirmed on histopathology of liver biopsies. Bile culture identified a monomicrobial infection with Providencia rettgeri, which was resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. The cat was treated with oral pradofloxacin for 4 weeks and remained well 4 months later. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: Providencia species are rarely reported in the veterinary literature and are an uncommon cause of disease in humans. The significance of this species in humans relates to the high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. This is the first report of P rettgeri causing clinical illness in a cat and highlights the importance of bile cultures in hepatic disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
