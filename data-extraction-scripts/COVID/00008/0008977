<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-02-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Ethical and Philosophical Considerations for Gain-of-Function Policy: The Importance of Alternate Experiments</TITLE><BODY>The Department of Health and Human Services Framework for Guiding Funding Decisions about Proposed Research Involving Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (PPPs) contains a series of principles for governing the funding and conduct of gain-of-function (GOF) research resulting in the creation of PPPs. In this article, I address one of these principles, governing the replacement of GOF research with alternate experiments. I argue that the principle fails to address the way that different experiments can promote the same values as those promoted by GOF research resulting in PPPs. I then address some objections to this claim, and provide policy recommendations moving forward.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
