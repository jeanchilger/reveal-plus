However efficient selection may be confounded if there are different genetic strains of NNV within and between regions and over years. This study uses statistical approaches and assessment of “characteristic attributes” (i.e. nucleotide positions that discriminate among strains) to assess whether published and new NNV RNA2 cds sequences show genetic differentiation over geography, host species and years. Rather clear evidence was found for regional strains of NNV. Interestingly, most of the geographic defining “characteristic attributes” were in codon position three, and not translated into differences for the protein capsid (i.e. they were synonymous variations), suggesting that while NNV strains were geographically isolated and had diverged in different regions for RNA sequences, selection had largely conserved the protein sequences among regions. The apparent selection constraint on the capsid protein may mitigate the risk that despite geographic subdivision, NNV strain variability will confound genetic selection for host resistance. The existence of regional Asian NNV strains may suggest that hatcheries are at risk from NNV not only from imported material but also from endemic reservoirs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
