<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-01-29</DATELINE><TITLE>A Low-Cost Palmtop High-Speed Capillary Electrophoresis Bioanalyzer with Laser Induced Fluorescence Detection</TITLE><BODY>In this work, we developed a miniaturized palmtop high-speed capillary electrophoresis (CE) system integrating whole modules, including picoliter-scale sample injection, short capillary-based fast CE, high-voltage power supply, orthogonal laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, battery, system control, on-line data acquisition, processing, storage, and display modules. A strategy of minimalist miniaturization combining minimal system design and low-cost system construction was adopted to achieve the instrument miniaturization with extremely low cost, which is differing from the current microfabrication strategy used in most reported miniaturized CE systems. With such a strategy, the total size of the bioanalyzer was minimized to 90 × 75 × 77 mm (length × width × height) and the instrument cost was reduced to ca. $500, which demonstrated the smallest and lowest-cost CE instrument with LIF detection in so far reported systems. The present bioanalyzer also exhibited comparable analytical performances to previously-reported high-speed CE systems. A limit of detection of 1.02 nM sodium fluorescein was obtained. Fast separations were achieved for multiple types of samples as amino acids, amino acid enantiomers, DNA fragments, and proteins with high efficiency. We applied this instrument in colorectal cancer diagnosis for detecting KRAS mutation status by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
