Since March 2016, four Zika cases have been confirmed in Zhejiang, China. Rapid assessment of people’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding Zika is crucial to its prevention and control. Web-based surveys to assess public KAP may be a growing trend; however, we had little experience with this method. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore KAP regarding Zika in residents of Zhejiang using both traditional paper- and innovative Internet-based investigations. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A paper-based version of the survey was used in a cross-sectional community study following multistage cluster random sampling, and an Internet-based survey was promoted through a local health education site. Data were interpreted via univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 447 community residents participated in the paper-based survey, with a response rate of 89.4% (447/500), and 621 eligible Internet users participated in the Internet-based survey, with a response rate of 36.92% (621/1682). Age, education level, and occupation differed significantly between participants in the paper- and Internet-based surveys. Participants completing the Internet-based survey were much younger (χ(2)(2)=144.7, P<.001) and had a higher level of education (χ(2)(2)=423.5, P<.001) than those completing the paper-based survey. Among participants completing the paper-based survey, there were more farmers, housewives, and unemployed people (χ(2)(3)=413.7, P<.001). Overall, 83.52% of participants (892/1068) knew the transmission route for Zika, 76.12% (813/1068) knew that pregnant women were at high risk of severe complications, 66.39% (709/1068) knew that contracting Zika during pregnancy could lead to newborn babies with microcephaly, and 98.88% (1056/1068) knew places where mosquitos could usually be found. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, participants completing the Internet-based survey were more likely to know the transmission route of Zika (odds ratio [OR]=5.0, 95% CI 3.0-8.0), the association between pregnant women with Zika and newborn babies with microcephaly (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.4-3.0), and that pregnant women were at high risk for Zika (OR 5.5, 95% CI 3.5-8.4) than those completing the paper-based survey. They were less likely to worry about contracting Zika (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9) and more likely to actively seek information about Zika than participants completing the paper-based survey (OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.0-5.6). CONCLUSIONS: Participants completing the Internet-based survey had a higher level of basic knowledge and more positive attitudes and behaviors than participants completing the paper-based survey. In addition to providing Web-based health information, the government should ensure sufficient access to health information for the elderly and less educated people in the community to improve health equity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
