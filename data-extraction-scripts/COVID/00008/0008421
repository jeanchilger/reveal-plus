<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-09-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Disease reservoirs: from conceptual frameworks to applicable criteria</TITLE><BODY>Central to the One Health approach and any disease eradication program is the question of whether a pathogen has a non-human reservoir. Despite well-established conceptual frameworks that define a reservoir of infection, empirical characterization of reservoirs often remains controversial, challenging and sometimes misleading. What is essentially missing are applicable requirements that standardize the use of the term ‘reservoir of infection’ across multiple disciplines. We propose an empirical framework, considering maintenance and feasible transmission of a pathogen, to standardize the acceptance of a disease reservoir across multiple disciplines. We demonstrate the intended use of these requirements by applying them to different diseases that are known to infect both humans and animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
