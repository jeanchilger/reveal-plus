Current immunotherapy approaches to target PSMA include peptide, cell, vector or DNA-based vaccines as well as passive administration of PSMA-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Conventional mAb immunotherapy has numerous logistical and practical limitations, including high production costs and a requirement for frequent dosing due to short mAb serum half-life. In this report, we describe a novel strategy of antibody-based immunotherapy against prostate carcinoma that utilizes synthetic DNA plasmids that encode a therapeutic human mAb that target PSMA. Electroporation-enhanced intramuscular injection of the DNA-encoded mAb (DMAb) plasmid into mice led to the production of functional and durable levels of the anti-PSMA antibody. The anti-PSMA produced in vivo controlled tumor growth and prolonged survival in a mouse model. This is likely mediated by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect with the aid of NK cells. Further study of this novel approach for treatment of human prostate disease and other malignant conditions is warranted.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
