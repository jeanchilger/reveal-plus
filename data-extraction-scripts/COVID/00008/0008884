Background Modern molecular techniques reveal new information on the role of respiratory viruses in community‐acquired pneumonia. In this study, we tried to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses and bacteria in patients with community‐acquired pneumonia who were admitted to the hospital. Methods Between April 2008 and April 2009, 408 adult patients (aged between 20 and 94 years) with community‐acquired pneumonia were tested for the presence of respiratory pathogens using bacterial cultures, real‐time PCR for viruses and bacteria, urinary antigen testing for Legionella and Pneumococci and serology for the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens. Results Pathogens were identified in 263 (64·5%) of the 408 patients. The most common single organisms in these 263 patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae (22·8%), Coxiella burnetii (6·8%) and influenza A virus (3·8%). Of the 263 patients detected with pathogens, 117 (44·5%) patients were positive for one or more viral pathogens. Of these 117 patients, 52 (44·4%) had no bacterial pathogen. Multiple virus infections (≥2) were found in 16 patients. Conclusion In conclusion, respiratory viruses are frequently found in patients with CAP and may therefore play an important role in the aetiology of this disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
