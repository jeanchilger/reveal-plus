In the last third of the mammalian lifespan, the maintenance of a balanced T-cell repertoire becomes highly challenging due to changes in T-cell production and consumption. In this Review, I ask whether latent persistent pathogens might be key factors that drive this imbalance and whether they determine the extent of age-associated immune deficiency&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
