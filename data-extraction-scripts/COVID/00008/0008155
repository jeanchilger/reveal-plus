A total of 29 left-over lung specimens that were obtained from patients who died from severe falciparum malaria were examined. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses revealed that ARDS coexisted with pulmonary edema and systemic bleeding; the severity was dependent on the level of hemozoin deposition in the lung and internal alveolar hemorrhaging. The loss of EPCR and TM was primarily identified in ARDS patients and was related to the level of hemozoin, parasitized red blood cell (PRBC) and white blood cell accumulation in the lung. Moreover, an in vitro analysis demonstrated that interleukin-13 and -31 and hemozoin induced pneumocytic cell injury and apoptosis, as assessed by EB/AO staining, electron microscopy and the up-regulation of CARD-9 mRNA (caspase recruitment domain-9 messenger-ribonucleic acid). The dysregulation of EPCR and TM in the lung, especially in those with increased levels of hemozoin, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of malaria-associated ARDS through an apoptotic pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
