<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-11-04</DATELINE><TITLE>Successful Treatment of Disseminated Nocardiosis Caused by Nocardia veterana in a Dog</TITLE><BODY>A 5‐year‐old male castrated Lhasa Apso cross was evaluated for a 1‐month history of inappetence, lethargy, gagging, and progressive right thoracic limb lameness. Synovial fluid analysis revealed nonseptic suppurative inflammation, and a diagnosis of immune‐mediated polyarthritis (IMPA) was made. After 3 months of treatment with prednisone and later cyclosporine, the dog developed multiple firm cutaneous and subcutaneous masses and a focal mass within the jejunum. Cultures of blood, urine, skin lesions, and the jejunal mass identified Nocardia veterana by matrix‐absorption laser desorption ionization‐time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (MALDI‐TOF MS) and allowed for earlier identification of the organism compared to more traditional secA1 gene sequencing. Immunosuppressive drug treatment was discontinued, and the dog was treated for 3 months by administration of trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMS). No recurrence of clinical signs was reported 1 year later. This case report highlights the clinical utility of MALDI‐TOF MS, particularly for the rapid identification of slow‐growing, fastidious organisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
