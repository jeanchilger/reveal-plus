In this paper, we developed a stand-alone pipeline called FastViromeExplorer for the detection and abundance quantification of viruses and phages in large metagenomic datasets by performing rapid searches of virus and phage sequence databases. Both simulated and real data from human microbiome and ocean environmental samples are used to validate FastViromeExplorer as a reliable tool to quickly and accurately identify viruses and their abundances in large datasets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
