The second was to determine the optimum adjuvant formulation of the inactivated PEDV vaccine that induces protection against viral challenge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To generate high titers of infectious PEDV, the QIAP1401 isolate was passaged in Vero cells. The experimental vaccines were prepared from a binary ethyleneimine-inactivated QIAP1401 strain passaged sequentially 70 times (QIAP1401-p70), formulated with four commercial adjuvants, and administered twice intramuscularly to growing pigs. Challenge studies using a virulent homologous strain of PEDV QIAP1401-p11, which was passaged 11 times after isolation, were performed to assess protection against disease progression and viral shedding during the 15-day observation period. The vaccine-induced antibody responses were measured in serum samples collected at predetermined time points by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and virus neutralization test. RESULTS: The QIAP1401-p70 strain had 42 amino acid (aa) mutations, including a 25 aa deletion, and was selected as the inactivated PEDV vaccine candidate. Although none of the pigs that received the experimental vaccines were completely protected against subsequent viral challenge, they exhibited a significantly higher immune response than did non-vaccinated control pigs. Among the vaccine groups, the highest antibody responses were observed in the pigs that received an oil-based multiphasic water/oil/water (W/O/W) emulsion adjuvanted vaccine, which delayed the onset of clinical symptoms and viral shedding. CONCLUSION: A novel inactivated PEDV vaccine formulated with a W/O/W emulsion adjuvant was both immunogenic and protective against viral challenge.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
