It also examines how HIV patients reconstruct their identities after the diagnosis of HIV. Four HIV patients (two males and two females) were interviewed in depth by an experienced medical social worker. Findings revealed that even as the illness trajectory of HIV has shifted from a terminal condition to a chronic one, living with HIV continues to be fraught with difficulty as society, especially in the Asian context, perceives HIV with much fear and disapproval. The participants had an overwhelming sense of shame when they were initially diagnosed with HIV and they had to reconstruct a liveable identity by containing the shroud of shame, reinforcing their normative identities and constructing new ones. These strategies help them to keep their shame at bay. This paper also unpacks nuanced insights of shame experienced by Chinese HIV patients in an Asian city dominated by Confucian values.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
