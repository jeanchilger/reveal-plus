To characterize the potential risk associated with different Ad5 vector delivery modes, we used immunocompetent and immunodeficient Rag2 (−/−) animals to establish mouse and rat models that could be monitored with bioluminescent imaging following intramuscular or intravascular infection with an engineered replication-incompetent Ad5 virus carrying the firefly luciferase gene (Ad5-Fluc). The Ad5 vector was less well-tolerated by Rag2 (−/−) animals than by wildtype ones, with delayed residence time, wider virus dissemination, less weight gain, and relatively severe pathological changes. In intravascularly Ad5-Fluc-infected Rag2 (−/−) mice, systemic virus dissemination extended from the abdomen to the limbs and head on day 9 post-infection. Additionally, significant increases in plasma TNF-α and IFN-γ, which may be important factors in the heightened immunopathology in the liver and brain, were detected in the Rag2 (−/−) mice 30 days after intravascular delivery. The Ad5 vector was better tolerated after intramuscular delivery than after intravascular delivery. Ad5-Fluc/Rag2 (−/−) mice and rats can be used as reliable models of an immunodeficient population in which to evaluate the safety of Ad5-vectored vaccines or gene therapy products.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
