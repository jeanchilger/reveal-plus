The enormous genetic diversity of IBV poses difficulty in diagnosing and controlling the virus. To understand the nature of IBV prevalent in the Kashmir Himalayas, we characterized two field strains, isolated from non-immunized broiler chickens, by sequence and phylogenetic analysis of S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein. The analysis revealed both the isolates are identical to each other, with nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of 99.4% and 98.4%, respectively. They exhibit variable sequence divergence in the S1 gene to that of the reference serotypes. Both are of “Massachusetts type” belonging to GI-1 lineage of the IBV génotype. The phylogenetic analysis revealed both of the isolates clustered into the same branch as that of many IBV strains recently reported from China and Iran. Likely, these regionally-related isolates represent revertant vaccine strains which may have been disseminated across the region by wild migratory birds. This study provides the first report of molecular evidence and phylogenetic characterization of the IBV from the Kashmir Himalayas and implicate the possible role of wild migratory birds in the spread of IBV in the region.
