Viruses are known to be responsible for a considerable proportion of ARIs in children. This study was undertaken to know the viral aetiology of wheezing among the children less than five years of age, admitted to a tertiary care hospital in eastern India. METHODS: Seventy five children, under the age of five years admitted with wheezing, were included in the study. Throat and nasal swabs were collected, and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to screen for influenza 1 and 2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, human meta-pneumovirus, bocavirus (HBoV), Coronavirus, adenovirus, Enterovirus and Parechovirus. RESULTS: The total viral detection rate was 28.57 per cent. Viral RNA markers were detected from children diagnosed to be having pneumonia (3 cases), bronchiolitis (9 cases), episodic wheeze (2 cases) and multitrigger wheeze (6 cases). RSV was the most common virus (35%) followed by PIV1, 2 and 3 (20%), HBoV (10%) and rhinovirus (5%). However, mixed infection was observed in 30 per cent of cases. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The study reported the presence of respiratory viral agents in 28.57 per cent of children with wheezing; RSV and PIV were most common, accounting to 55 per cent of the total cases. Mixed infection was reported in 30 per cent of cases. Seasonal variation in the occurrence of these viruses was also noted. Further studies need to be done with a large sample and longer follow up period to verify these findings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
