<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>A Fully Integrated Paper-Microfluidic Electrochemical Device for Simultaneous Analysis of Physiologic Blood Ions</TITLE><BODY>A fully integrated paper microfluidic electrochemical device equipped with three different cation permeable films is developed to determine blood ions (Cl(−), Na(+), K(+), and Ca(2+)) at a time. These blood ions that are normally dissolved in the real human blood stream are essential for cell metabolisms and homeostasis in the human body. Abnormal concentration of blood ions causes many serious disorders. The optimized microfluidic device working without any external power source can directly and effectively separate human blood components, and subsequently detect a specific blood ion with minimized interference. The measured sensitivity to Cl(−), K(+), Na(+), and Ca(2+) are −47.71, 45.97, 51.06, and 19.46 in mV decade(−1), respectively. Potentiometric responses of the microfluidic devices to blood serum samples are in the normal ranges of each cation, and comparable with responses from the commercial blood ion analyzer Abbott i-Stat.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
