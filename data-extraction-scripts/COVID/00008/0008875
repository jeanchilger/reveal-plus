(2011) Role of procalcitonin and C‐reactive protein in differentiation of mixed bacterial infection from 2009 H1N1 viral pneumonia. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 5(6), 398–403. Background Mixed bacterial infection is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality during influenza pandemics. We evaluated procalcitonin (PCT) and C‐reactive protein (CRP) in differentiating pneumonia caused by mixed bacterial and 2009 H1N1 influenza infection from 2009 H1N1 influenza infection alone. Methods Data were collected retrospectively over a 7‐month period during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Patients visiting emergency department and diagnosed as community‐acquired pneumonia caused by 2009 H1N1 infection were included (n = 60). Results Mixed bacterial and viral infection pneumonia (n = 16) had significantly higher PCT and CRP levels than pneumonia caused by 2009 H1N1 influenza alone (n = 44, P = 0·019, 0·022 respectively). The sensitivity and specificity for detection of mixed bacterial infection pneumonia was 56% and 84% for PCT > 1·5 ng/ml, and 69% and 63% for CRP > 10 mg/dl. Using PCT and CRP in combination, the sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 93%, respectively. Conclusion Procalcitonin and CRP alone and their combination had a moderate ability to detect pneumonia of mixed bacterial infection during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Considering high specificity, combination of low CRP and PCT result may suggest that pneumonia is unlikely to be caused by mixed bacterial infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
