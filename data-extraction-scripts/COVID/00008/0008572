Since the diagnosis of life-threatening neutropenia in cancer patients requires a distinct neutrophil count, this study aimed to determine the comparative performance between the neutrophil and granulocyte count. DESIGN AND METHODS: A database of 508 646 venous full blood count results measured on a laboratory reference analyser was mined from a large oncology unit. The relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts was assessed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to classify results into neutropenia grades using an equivalent granulocyte count. RESULTS: Granulocyte to neutrophil count correlation was 0.997. The accuracy for classification into neutropenia grades using the derived equivalent granulocyte count ranges was 96.4%. Identification of results with a neutrophil count <1.5×10(9) cells/L using an equivalent granulocyte count of <1.69×10(9) cells/L resulted in sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 98.0%, 99.5%, 97.8% and 99.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the relationship between granulocyte and neutrophil counts, measured on a laboratory analyser, in a large population of patients with malignancies and receiving anti-cancer therapies. However, this relationship must be established using a point of care testing system with a three-part differential count before considering the possibility that a granulocyte count can guide clinical decisions in the absence of a definitive neutrophil count, to reduce the frequency and severity of neutropenic complications in patients receiving cancer treatments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
