Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed bilateral papilledema in both calves. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests for bovine viral diarrhea virus, rotavirus and coronavirus were all negative. The levels of serum vitamin A in the two affected calves were 0.317 µg/dl and 0.481 µg/dl, respectively. These values are much lower than the normal vitamin A levels; therefore, the calves were diagnosed with hypovitaminosis A.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
