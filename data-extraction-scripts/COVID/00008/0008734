The major signaling pathway activated by IFNs is the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, which leads to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including many antiviral effectors. Viruses have evolved various strategies with which to antagonize the JAK/STAT pathway to influence viral virulence and pathogenesis. In recent years, notable progress has been made to better understand the JAK/STAT pathway activated by IFNs and antagonized by viruses. In this review, recent progress in research of the JAK/STAT pathway activated by type I IFNs, non-canonical STAT activation, viral antagonism of the JAK/STAT pathway, removing of the JAK/STAT antagonist from viral genome for attenuation, and the potential pathogenesis roles of tyrosine phosphorylation-independent non-canonical STATs activation during virus infection are discussed in detail. We expect that this review will provide new insight into the understanding the complexity of the interplay between JAK/STAT signaling and viral antagonism.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
