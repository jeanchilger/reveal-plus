Here we report the design, generation and characterization of BiKEs which consist of CD16A binding human antibody domains fused through a flexible linker to an engineered one-domain soluble human CD4. In presence of cells expressing HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), these BiKEs activated specifically CD16A-expressing Jurkat T cells, degranulated NK cells, induced cytokine production and killed Env-expressing cells. They also effectively mediated killing of chronically and acutely HIV-1 infected T cells by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presumed ability of these CD4-based BiKEs to bind all HIV-1 isolates, their small size and fully human origin, combined with high efficacy suggest their potential for HIV-1 eradication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
