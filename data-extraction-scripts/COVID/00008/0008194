<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-12-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Telerehabilitation Solution Conceptual Paper for Community-Based Exercise Rehabilitation of Patients Discharged After Critical Illness</TITLE><BODY>A novel service oriented platform has been developed under the framework of the Telerehabilitation Service funded by the Cross Border Cooperation Programme Greece Cyprus 2007 – 2013 to support tele-supervised exercise rehabilitation for patients after hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU). The platform enables multiparty, interregional bidirectional audio/visual communication between clinical practitioners and post-ICU patients. It also enables patient group-based vital sign real time monitoring, patients’ clinical record bookkeeping, and individualized and group-based patient online exercise programs. The exercise programs intended for the service are based on successful cardiorespiratory rehabilitation programs, individualized and monitored by a multidisciplinary team. The eligibility study of former ICU patients to participate in such a service as well as a cost benefit analysis are presented to support the cost effectiveness of the telerehabilitation program in addition to the expected health benefits to a large proportion of former ICU patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
