The most common eitological agents causing bronchiolitis in young children are the respiratory viruses and of the commonly encountered respiratory viruses, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) has a propensity for causing bronchiolitis. Indeed, RSV bronchiolitis remains the major reason why previously healthy infants are admitted to hospital. Why RSV infection is such a predominant cause of bronchiolitis is the subject of this review. By reviewing the available histopathology of RSV bronchiolitis both in humans and relevant animal models we identify hallmark features of RSV infection of the distal airways and focus attention on the consequences of columnar cell cytopathology occurring in the bronchioles, which directly impacts the development of bronchiolar obstruction, inflammation and disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
