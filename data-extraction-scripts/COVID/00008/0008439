<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-08-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Diseases and Molecular Diagnostics: A Step Closer to Precision Medicine</TITLE><BODY>The current advent of molecular technologies together with a multidisciplinary interplay of several fields led to the development of genomics, which concentrates on the detection of pathogenic events at the genome level. The structural and functional genomics approaches have now pinpointed the technical challenge in the exploration of disease-related genes and the recognition of their structural alterations or elucidation of gene function. Various promising technologies and diagnostic applications of structural genomics are currently preparing a large database of disease-genes, genetic alterations etc., by mutation scanning and DNA chip technology. Further the functional genomics also exploring the expression genetics (hybridization-, PCR- and sequence-based technologies), two-hybrid technology, next generation sequencing with Bioinformatics and computational biology. Advances in microarray “chip” technology as microarrays have allowed the parallel analysis of gene expression patterns of thousands of genes simultaneously. Sequence information collected from the genomes of many individuals is leading to the rapid discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. Further advances of genetic engineering have also revolutionized immunoassay biotechnology via engineering of antibody-encoding genes and the phage display technology. The Biotechnology plays an important role in the development of diagnostic assays in response to an outbreak or critical disease response need. However, there is also need to pinpoint various obstacles and issues related to the commercialization and widespread dispersal of genetic knowledge derived from the exploitation of the biotechnology industry and the development and marketing of diagnostic services. Implementation of genetic criteria for patient selection and individual assessment of the risks and benefits of treatment emerges as a major challenge to the pharmaceutical industry. Thus this field is revolutionizing current era and further it may open new vistas in the field of disease management.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
