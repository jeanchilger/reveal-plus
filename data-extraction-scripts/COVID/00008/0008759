Little is currently known about the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in KSHV entry. We recently demonstrated that KSHV induces a plethora of host cell miRNAs during the early stages of infection. In this study, we show the ability of host cell novel miR-36 to specifically inhibit KSHV-induced expression of interferon induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) to limit virus infection of cells. Transfecting cells with miR-36 mimic specifically lowered IFITM1 expression and thereby significantly dampening KSHV infection. In contrast, inhibition of miR-36 using miR-36 inhibitor had the direct opposite effect on KSHV infection of cells, allowing enhanced viral infection of cells. The effect of miR-36 on KSHV infection of cells was at a post-binding stage of virus entry. The highlight of this work was in deciphering a common theme in the ability of miR-36 to regulate infection of closely related DNA viruses: KSHV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes simplexvirus-2 (HSV-2). Taken together, we report for the first time the ability of host cell miRNA to regulate internalization of KSHV, EBV, and HSV-2 in hematopoietic and endothelial cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
