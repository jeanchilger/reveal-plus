Influenza and Ebolaviruses are zoonotic RNA viruses mutating very rapidly, and their sequence changes must be characterized intensively to design therapeutic oligonucleotides with long utility. Focusing on a total of 182 experimentally validated siRNAs for influenza A, B and Ebolaviruses compiled by the siRNA database, we conducted time-series analyses of occurrences of siRNA targets in these viral genomes. Reflecting their high mutation rates, occurrences of target oligonucleotides evidently fluctuate in viral populations and often disappear. Time-series analysis of the one-base changed sequences derived from each original target identified the oligonucleotide that shows a compensatory increase and will potentially become the ‘awaiting-type oligonucleotide’ the combined use of this oligonucleotide with the original can provide therapeutics with long utility. This strategy is also useful for assigning diagnostic reverse transcription-PCR primers with long utility.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
