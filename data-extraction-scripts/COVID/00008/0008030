Vimentin is a highly abundant intermediate filament protein, and its intracellular functions have been investigated in a large number of studies. Recently, however, vimentin has been shown to take part in significant processes outside the cell. Our understanding of the functions of extracellular vimentin is, however, limited. In this study we demonstrate that a vimentin specific antibody, obtained by phage antibody technology, promotes tube formation of endothelial cells in a 2D matrigel assay. By binding vimentin, the antibody increases the tube formation by 21% after 5 hours of incubation. Addition of the antibody directly to cultured endothelial cells does not influence endothelial cell migration or proliferation. The enhanced tube formation can be seen for up to 10 hours where after the effect decreases. It is shown that the antibody-binding site is located on the coil 2 domain of vimentin. To our knowledge this is the first study that demonstrates an enhanced tube formation by binding vimentin in a 2D matrigel assay under normoxic conditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
