Some studies found that the virus was a new kind of virus which had never been found in the human body. Then, the virus was named 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO). 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection is one of the essential indicators of NCP (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia). Recently, some false-negative cases in China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Hangzhou Hospital led the clinical doctors to question the value of the nucleic acid detection. In this paper, more than 3 000 results of 2019-nCoV detection in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University were analyzed. Attention should be paid to the root cause of false-negative results and the related countermeasures should be taken.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
