<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Anesthesia management for cesarean section during novel coronavirous epidemic</TITLE><BODY>Thirty-six puerperas who underwent emergency cesarean section at Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 24, 2020 to February 9, 2020, who all wore medical surgical masks, were retrospectively included in this study. Anesthesia management was performed under tertiary medical protection measures. A dedicated anesthesia equipment was separately sterilized. Narcotic drugs were used for one patient only, and disposable medical supplies were used for anesthetic supplies. Contact transmission should be avoided when a neonate required resuscitation, and early isolation and nucleic acid testing were provided for the neonates. The rate of suspected cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was 11% , and the rate of clinically diagnosed cases was 17% before surgery. The rate of clinically diagnosed cases of 2019-nCoV was 22%, the rate of confirmed cases was 8%, and the total positive rate of diagnosis was 31% after surgery. The rate of neuraxial anesthesia was 86%, the rate of general anesthesia was 14%, the time of spinal puncture was (15&plusmn;7) min, the time of tracheal intubation under general anesthesia was (2.1&plusmn;1.3) min, the operation time was (95&plusmn;36) min, and blood loss was (276&plusmn;166) ml. The Apgar score of newborns was 8.8 &plusmn; 0.5. There was 1 neonate whose&nbsp;mother was diagnosed as having 2019 novel coronavirous disease after operation, an oropharyngeal swab specimen was obtained at 36 h of birth, and the swab was tested positive for 2019-nCoV by nucleic acid testing. As of February 10, 2020, an anesthesiologist involved in the operation was diagnosed to have infection by 2019-nCoV. In conclusion, diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirous disease during pregnancy is more difficult, it is necessary to perform anesthesia management for cesarean section under tertiary medical protection. Although the difficulty in anesthesia operation is increased under tertiary medical protection, anesthesiologists can carry out standardized anesthesia management and guarantee the safety of maternal and infants and anesthesiologists themselves as long as they are rigorously trained and adhere to protective protocols.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
