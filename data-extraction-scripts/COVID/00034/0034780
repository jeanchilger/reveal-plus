Additionally, recent state and federal laws—so-called “right to try legislation”—allow patients to approach drug companies directly for access prior to FDA approval. While these pathways provide potential access for individual patients to investigational drugs, different EA pathways permit entire groups of certain patients to access investigational drugs prior to FDA approval. This review focuses on special categories of EA INDs intended for multiple patients—the intermediate-group IND and the widespread-treatment IND—as well as emergency authorization for use of investigational drugs and biological products (e.g., vaccines) in public health emergencies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
