Methods We design the protocol as a real world study, which includes two groups: prospective intervention cohort (T1) and historical control group (T2). For T1 group, ninety patients will be enrolled who are diagnosed as NCP. All patients in T1 group will receive standard therapies following the recommendation in the guidelines of National Commission of Health, and they will be administered an anti-virus regimen includes LPV/r and FTC/TAF. The T2 group will enroll patients who have received single regimen includes LPV/r. The major outcome is the survival rate of patients. Secondary outcomes are the time of seroconversion of RNA, ARDS progression rate and length of hospital stay. Conclusions The results of this real world study might provide clinical practitioners a high efficiency and fast antivirus regimen for NCP. In addition, the conduction of this study will accelerate screening for other new effective therapeutic method.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
