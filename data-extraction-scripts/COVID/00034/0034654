The pregnant woman delivered a boy by cesarean section at 37 +2 gestational weeks due to severe liver dysfunction. She subsequently had a high fever 2 days later, and novel coronavirus infection was confirmed by nucleic acid test in a throat swab. After a 12-day isolation and support treatment, her two consecutive throat swab results for novel coronavirus turned negative and she was discharged. The novel coronavirus was tested in the patient's blood, urine, breast milk as well as the neonatal throat swab, and the results were all negative. The neonate had an elevated myocardial enzyme, but was otherwise well and was discharged after 14-day isolation with normal myocardial enzyme.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
