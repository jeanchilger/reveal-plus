<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Diagnosis and rational approach to emergency vascular surgery in the shadow of novel coronavirus pneumonia</TITLE><BODY>Objective To explore a safe, effective and rapid rescue method and key points for the management of vascular surgical emergencies in an area under guaranting Covid-19 (corona virus disease 2019) . Methods Under the guidance of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines , 4 cases of vascular surgical emergency patients admitted to our department from Feb 1 to Feb 10, 2020 were screened for COVID-19 and given emergency vascular surgical treatment. Results Two patients had acute thoracic aortic dissection, one patient had acute left foot ulcer with infection, one patient had severe carotid artery stenosis and frequent TIA. All patients were diagnosed quickly according to the three-level triage process. Endovascular repair (TEVAR) was performed in 2 cases, carotid stenting in 1 case, and left foot amputation in 1 case. Two patients running postoperative fever below 38&#8451; were safely excluded COVID-19 and cured. There were no other major morbidities nor mortality. Conclusions Under the COVID-19 prevention and control guidelines, the establishing of a comprehensive prevention and control system of patient-medicine-care-management helps to perform confine operation on vascular surgical emergency.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
