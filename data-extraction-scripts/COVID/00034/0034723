Direct antigen detection (DAD) is rapid, but lacks sensitivity, whereas nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) is more sensitive, but also more time-consuming. Objectives To evaluate the performance of a rapid isothermal NAT and two DADs. Study design During February–May 2014, we tested 211 consecutive patients with influenza-like illness using a commercial isothermal NAT (Alere™ Influenza A&B) as well as the DAD Sofia® Influenza A+B and BinaxNOW® Influenza A&B for detection of influenza-A and -B virus. RespiFinder-22® a commercial multiplex NAT served as reference test. Serial 10-fold dilutions of influenza-A and -B cell culture supernatants were examined. Another 225 patient samples were tested during December 2014–February 2015. Results Compared to RespiFinder-22®, the isothermal NAT Alere™ Influenza A&B, and the DAD Sofia® Influenza A+B and BinaxNOW® Influenza A&B had sensitivities of 77.8%, 59.3% and 29.6%, and specificities of 99.5%, 98.9% and 100%, respectively, for the first 211 patient samples. Alere™ Influenza A&B showed 85.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the second cohort. Isothermal NAT was 10-100-fold more sensitive compared to DAD for influenza virus culture supernatants with a lower limit of detection of 5000–50,000 copies/mL. The average turn-around time (TAT) of isothermal NAT and DADs was 15min, but increased to 110min for Alere™ Influenza A&B, 30min for BinaxNOW® Influenza A&B, and 45min for Sofia® Influenza A+B, when analyzing batches of 6 samples. Conclusion Simple sample processing and a TAT of 15min render isothermal NAT Alere™ Influenza A&B suitable for sequential near-patient testing, but the TAT advantage is lost when testing of larger series.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
