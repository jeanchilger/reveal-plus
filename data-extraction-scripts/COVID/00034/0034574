Recently, a severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported at December 2019 in the city Wuhan, Hubei province, China3, 4, 5, which was also named as pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome (PARS)6 and can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to seriously endanger human health. Up to 24th of February 2020, at least 77779 cases have been reported with 2666 fatal cases according to the report from China CDC. However, the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from COVID-19 patients is still unknown. Here we show that after the SARS-CoV-2 infection, CD4+ T lymphocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. The cytokines environment induces inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerate the inflammation. Given that large amount of inflammatory cells infiltrations have been observed in lungs from severe COVID-19 patients7, 8, these aberrant pathogenic Th1 cells and inflammatory monocytes may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality. Our results demonstrate that excessive non-effective host immune responses by pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may associate with severe lung pathology. Thus, we suggest that monoclonal antibodies targeting GM-CSF or interleukin 6 may be effective in blocking inflammatory storms and, therefore, be a promising treatment of severe COVID-19 patients&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
