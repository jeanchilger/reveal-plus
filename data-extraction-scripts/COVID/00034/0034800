Antigenic differences were observed among the isolates in a one-way hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test using a polyclonal antiserum against the Mebus bovine coronavirus isolate. Differences were observed on isoelectric focusing among viral proteins with isoelectric points between 4.45–4.65. Most of the BCV isolates were susceptible to hygromycin B (0.5mM) whereas a few hygromycin B resistant isolates were also found.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
