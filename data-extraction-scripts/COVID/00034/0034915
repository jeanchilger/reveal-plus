Thus, the development of novel anti-BVDV strategies are urgently needed. The nonstructural protein 5 (NS5B) of BVDV is essential for viral replication. Further, the camel single-domain antibody (nanobody) represents a promising antiviral approach with the advantages of small size, stable structure, high specificity and solubility, and the recognition of specific epitopes. However, no NS5B-specific nanobodies against BVDV have been reported. In this study, NS5B-specific nanobodies were isolated from a phage display library of variable domains of Camellidae heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs). Further, an MDBK cell line stably expressing Nb1 was established to explore antiviral activity. Results showed that Nb1 could markedly suppress BVDV replication and interact with the BVDV NS5B protein. This suggests that nanobodies have potential for the development of novel antiviral drugs against BVDV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
