Methods Twenty-four patients with suspected NCP admitted to Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People&rsquo;s Hospital and Jinshan Branch Hospital between January and February, 2020 were chosen as our research subjects. Early clinical features and radiographic changes were analyzed in 10 patients of confirmed NCP and 14 patients of excluded NCP. Results In the early stage, all 24 suspected patients were mild, and had normal blood gas analysis. Of 10 diagnosed patients, 50% were male. All the 10 patients had fever and fatigue, with body temperature between 37.5&#8451; and 38.5&#8451;. Only 1 patient had dry cough. 2 patients had no clear epidemiological exposure history, the other 8 had a clear epidemiological exposure, with a possible incubation period of 1-10 days. From CT imaging, lesions were characterized as ground glass shadow ( n =9), which could be unilateral ( n =1) or bilateral ( n =9), and were mainly close to the pleura ( n =9), with nodule shadow ( n =1) and without focal necrosis, and could combined with pleural effusion ( n =1. Among patients excluded NCP, all 14 patients had a clear history of epidemic exposure, with an onset time of 1 to 13 days. 12 patients had fever , including 4 with temperature &gt; 38.5&deg;C, 8 with temperature 37.3-38.5&deg;C, and 2 without fever. All patients had fatigue , 7 patients had dry cough and 2 patients had chest pain. From CT imaging, ground glass shadow appeared in 4 patients , lesions were unilateral in 10 patients and bilateral in 4 patients , and the lesions were relatively sporadic, without necrosis or pleural effusion. Conclusion 1&#65294;Not all patients with NCP have a direct history of epidemiology exposure, some patients may be infected unknowingly. 2. According to CT imaging, NCP seems to have no special manifestations different from other viral pneumonia. 3. NCP is more common among middle-aged people.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
