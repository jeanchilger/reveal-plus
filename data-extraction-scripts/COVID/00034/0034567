<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Construction of 5G intelligent medical service system in novel coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control</TITLE><BODY>Objective: To analyze application fields of 5G communication technology in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic prevention and control, and build a 5G intelligent medical service system for COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control in China. Methods: We collected and analyzed 5G technology application cases used in the fight against COVID-19 from December 2019 to February 2020: 5G + telemedicine application cases, 5G + negative pressure ambulance cases, 5G + remote monitoring cases, 5G + artificial intelligence cases, 5G + infrared thermography temperature detection cases, 5G + big data analysis cases for epidemic prevention and control. Results: Through the analysis of 5G application cases in COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control, we found out the key elements of 5G intelligent medical service system in COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control. By optimizing and upgrading the internal service mode of the hospital, breaking the internal and external barriers, integrating internal and external resources, and strengthening 5G intelligent medical security, we can form a 5G intelligent medical service system for COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control, including application layer, technical service layer, network support layer and security system layer. Conclusion: 5G communication technology has the characteristics of faster speed, shorter time delay and denser capacity. In COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control work, it can further improve the efficiency of doctors' diagnosis, improve patients' medical experience, realize the remote sharing of high-quality medical resources and real-time information exchange, effectively block the spread of epidemic, alleviate the shortage of medical resources and medical staff, and make the epidemic prevention and control more efficient.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
