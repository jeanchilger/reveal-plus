There was significant difference between different years ( &chi; 2 =6.967, P &lt;0.05). The median time for newly admitted patients to receive radiotherapy was two days, which was not significantly longer than the interval in 2019 ( P &gt;0.05). Staffs and patients were generally satisfied with the current prevention measures.
