Method The clinical and CT imaging data of 60 patients with imported COVID-19 cured and discharged from January to February 2020 in Anhui Province were retrospectively collected. The clinical characteristics of the patients and the characteristics of chest CT images at discharge were analyzed. Results Fever (57 cases) and cough (55 cases) were the main symptoms in 60 patients. At the initial diagnosis, 5 cases were mild, 53 were ordinary, and 2 were severe. In 5 light patients, 3 cases were negative in the whole course of CT examination, 2 cases were negative in the first time and abnormal in the second time. . The first CT imaging features of 55 patients (53 common type and 2 severe type)were mainly bilateral lung involvement (51 cases), multiple lesions (33 cases), more common under the pleura (40 cases), and ground glass opacities were the most common. (55 cases). The clinical features of chest CT in clinical outcomes are that the ground glass shadow in the lung gradually fades and was completely absorbed (19 cases); the scope of ground glass shadow in the lung expanded and progressed to crazy-paving, consolidation shadow, and the lesion gradually absorbs again followed by Fibrous cord shadows (27 cases); ground-glass opacities in the lungs quickly progressed to a consolidation and then slowly absorbed . Most of the lesions were accompanied by more residual fibrous cord shadows (4 cases). In 2 severe patients, the lesions in the lungs were larger ground glass, and a big amount of fibrous foci remained after slowly absorption. Conclusion Chest CT plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of imported COVID-19, and the degree of lung involvement seen on CT images is in good agreement with clinical outcome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
