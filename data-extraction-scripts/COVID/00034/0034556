Methods A retrospective study was conducted of the COVID-19 infections in the 51 medical staff and patients from 31 December, 2019 to 14 February, 2020 at Department of Traumatology and Microsurgery, Zhongnan Hospital. The prevention and control measures were upgraded after 20 January, 2020 to address the serious epidemic situation, including preventive disinfection, terminal disinfection and personnel disinfection in wards, management of emergency patients, inpatients and patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, and training, management and psychological intervention of medical staff. The outcomes resulting from different prevention and control measures before and after 20 January, 2020 were compared. Results From 31 December, 2019 to 20 January, 2020, there were altogether 3 cases of definite COVID-19 infection and 2 ones of suspected COVID-19 infection at the department. One doctor, one technician and one nurse were diagnosed as definite COVID-19 infection while one nurse and one patient as suspected COVID-19 infection. The 4 medical staff members infected were cured and discharged before 14 February, 2020 but unfortunately the one patient infected died.
