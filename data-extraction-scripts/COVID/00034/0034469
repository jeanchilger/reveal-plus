Although the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in provinces outside of Hubei Province has declined continuously since February 4, the epidemic of COVID-19 remains serious. As companies resume work, it is still inevitable that some high-energy orthopedic trauma patients and elderly patients with low-energy fractures will need surgical treatment. The operating room, as a place for close contact between doctors, patients and nurses, increases the risk of infection and transmission. Based on the current needs of orthopedic trauma patients and the situation of the country's resistance to the epidemic of COVID-19, the authors expound the operating room management, preparation of medical materials, transfer of patients needing surgery, intraoperative protection and post-operative end disinfection in Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University so as to provide reference for prevention and control management of the operating room during the epidemic period.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
