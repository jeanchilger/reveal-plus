Due to immaturity of immune function and the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, neonates are particularly susceptible to 2019-nCoV. The perinatal-neonatal departments should cooperate closely and take integrated approaches, and the neonatal intensive care unit should prepare the emergency plan for 2019-nCoV infection as far as possible, so as to ensure the optimal management and treatment of potential victims. According to the latest 2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Working Group for the Prevention and Control of Neonatal 2019-nCoV Infection in the Perinatal Period of the Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics puts forward recommendations for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infection in neonates.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
