This LRLRGG ubiquitin-like motif is found in a limited number of mammalian non-ubiquitin proteins, including the MAP3K Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase-1 (ASK1), which activates MAPK signaling pathways. The c-terminus of ASK1 binds to the 19S cap of the proteasome allowing ASK1 to phosphorylate and inhibit proteasomal activity. We investigated whether the ubiquitin-like sequence in the c-terminus of ASK1 mediates its association with and inhibition of the proteasome. To test this we generated ASK1 with substitutions or deletions in this ubiquitin-like domain and examined the activation of cellular signaling and the association of ASK1 with the 19S cap of the proteasome. We show that ASK1 mutants have reduced association with the 19S cap of the proteasome, reduced capacity to inhibit the proteasome, and diminished ability to inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Mutant forms of ASK1 also had reduced capacity to activate JNK signaling, suggesting that the ubiquitin-like motif in ASK1 is also important for coordinating the balance between JNK and NF-κB signaling. Together these results demonstrate that the ubiquitin-like sequence of ASK1 is important for binding to and inhibition of the proteasome, and for the coordinated activation of cellular NF-κB and JNK signaling.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
