ZIKV infection may be associated with congenital malformations in infected fetuses and severe neurological and systemic complications in infected adults. There are currently limited treatment options for ZIKV infection. AR-12 (OSU-03012) is a celecoxib derivative cellular kinase inhibitor that has broad-spectrum antiviral activities. In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity and mechanism of AR-12 against ZIKV. We evaluated the in vitro anti-ZIKV activity of AR-12, using cell protection and virus yield reduction assays, in multiple clinically relevant cell lines, and the in vivo treatment effects of AR-12 in a lethal mouse model using type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. AR-12 inhibited ZIKV strains belonging to both the African and Asian/American lineages in Huh-7 and/or neuronal cells. AR12's IC50 against ZIKV was consistently <2 μM in these cells. ZIKV-infected A129 mice treated with intraperitoneally or orally administered AR-12 had significantly higher survival rate (50.0%–83.3% vs 0%, P < 0.05), less body weight loss, and lower blood and tissue ZIKV RNA loads than untreated control A129 mice. These anti-ZIKV effects were likely the results of down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by AR-12. Clinical trials using the clinically available and broad-spectrum AR-12 as an empirical treatment should be considered especially for patients residing in or returning from areas endemic of ZIKV and other arboviral infections who present with an acute undifferentiated febrile illness.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
