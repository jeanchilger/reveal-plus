Although China has adopted unprecedented strict quarantine and closed management measures to prevent the spreading of the disease, Department of Traumatic Orthopedics may still have to manage NCP patients with open fractures or severe trauma that require emergency surgery. Therefore, the identification and management of 2019-nCoV infection as soon as possible as well as the protection of all medical staff involved in the emergency treatment of patients are the severe challenges faced by orthopedic traumatologists during the prevention and control of NCP. Based on the characteristics of such patients and related diagnosis and treatment experiences during the epidemic of NCP, the authors formulate the surgical management strategies for orthopedic trauma patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
