<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Prevention and treatment strategies of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine for acute abdomen during the outbreak of COVID-19</TITLE><BODY>At present, the prevention and control of the COVID-19 is still severe, its pathogen SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and pathogenic, and the population is generally susceptible. In order to deal with the epidemic, selective operation can be postponed, but most of the patients with acute abdominal diseases are commonly in clinic, with acute onset and severe condition, and most of them are accompanied with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, so emergency operation is needed.Under the condition of the current epidemic&mdash;COVID-19, it requires a higher standard to diagnose and treat patients with acute abdomen. The first step is to carry out procedures to identify whether the patient is infected or not. Those who are not infected can go through the normal treating procedures.For patients diagnosed with COVID-19 or suspected patients, the second step is to achieve classified diagnoses and treatments, and to adopt a treating plan that integrates TCM and western medicine.In order to protect patients and medical staff, the COVID-19 in hospital transmission must be avoided. For patients with COVID-19 who need emergency surgery, we must strictly comply with the hospital's protection regulations, closely coordinate the relevant departments of surgery, perform the three-level protection, operate in accordance with the principle of damage control in the negative pressure surgery room, and return to the isolation ward according to the prevention and control process after operation. For units without surgical conditions, patients should be transferred to hospital in time on the premise of maximum damage control, and patients must not be delayed for timely diagnosis and treatment due to the epidemic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
