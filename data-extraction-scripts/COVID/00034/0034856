<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-02-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Contamination of Food</TITLE><BODY>A review of the relevant foodborne viruses is presented. Published data from scientific journals as well as the data presented in official reports and published on the Internet were used for this review. In the review, information is given for the main foodborne viruses, implicated virus species, and food matrices involved, some history data are given, as well as modes of transmission, and sources of the virus presence in food. Results of surveys on the presence of viruses in different kind of foods commodities (fresh produces and shellfish) and in some cases connections to caused outbreaks are presented. Also, possible zoonotic infection and implicated viruses that could be transmitted through food are given. Human Norovirus followed by hepatitis A virus are the most common foodborne viruses, which are transmitted by food consumed raw, such as shellfish, fresh vegetables, and berry fruit. In developed countries, hepatitis E virus is increasingly being recognized as an emerging viral foodborne pathogen that includes zoonotic transmission via pork products. The existing knowledge gaps and the major future expectations in the detection and surveillance of foodborne viruses are mentioned.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
