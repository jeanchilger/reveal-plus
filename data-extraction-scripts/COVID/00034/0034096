Antibody levels in people associated with poultry were compared to those in people having limited poultry association. Antibody levels to three avian viruses: infectious bursal disease virus, a birnavirus; Newcastle disease virus, a paramyxovirus; and avian infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Differences between the two study groups were evident: people having a known association with poultry showed significantly higher levels of antibodies to Newcastle disease and avian infectious bronchitis virus. Antibodies detected may be due to virus exposure rather than zoonoses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
