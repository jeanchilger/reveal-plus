<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-01-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Helper virus-independent trans-replication of hepatitis C virus-derived minigenome</TITLE><BODY>We have previously described a synthetic T7-driven cDNA minigenome containing the antisense sequence of luciferase gene and internal ribosome entry site of encephalomyocarditis virus flanked by 5′- and 3′-end sequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) that contain cis-acting replication elements. Synthesis of minus-strand RNA from the artificial minigenome was determined by using Huh-7 cells harboring autonomously replicating HCV subgenome as a helper for provision of functional replication components. To further confirm and extend these studies, we investigated here whether the minigenome replication system could be reconstituted by transfection of naïve Huh-7 cells with plasmid expressing nonstructural (NS) proteins. Reporter assay and Northern blot analysis revealed that trans-expression of NS proteins from 3 to 5 resulted in high level of luciferase activity and synthesized minus-strand RNA. The analogous result was also obtained with the minigenome derived from HCV 2a, and both HCV 1b- and 2a-derived NS protein were able to support the chimeric minigenomes whose 5′- or 3′-end was replaced by the respective region of the heterologous virus. These results provide a basis for establishing the reverse genetic system that is helpful to study cis- and trans-acting factors involved in HCV RNA replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
