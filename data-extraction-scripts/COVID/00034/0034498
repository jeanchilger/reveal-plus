<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Epitranscriptome analysis of COVID-19 prevention and control</TITLE><BODY>Objective The purpose of this review of COVID-19 related research is to deepen our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, which would be inspire new ideas for targeted drug development and vaccine design, and further empower the prevention and control COVID-19. Methods Through literature research and data analysis, we explored the process and mechanism of epitranscriptomics modification to regulate the replication and infectivity of COVID-19. Results Provide important ideas and technical support for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infections and emerging epidemic diseases. Conclusions Taking the new research direction of epitranscriptomics as the starting point, it is expected to open up new scientific research concepts and paradigms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
