<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>The application of privacy protection and artificial intelligence technology in the information auxiliary system of the prevention and control of COVID-19</TITLE><BODY>Objective The outbreak of novel coronavirus raised many problems in the auxiliary information system of epidemic prevention and control, which including the need to prevent key data from being illegal modification, traceability, lack of decision support systems at different levels, barriers to cross regional cooperation and low automation of case diagnosis. Methods In this paper, artificial intelligence, security computing supporting privacy protection, block chain and other emerging technologies are introduced into the epidemic prevention and control auxiliary information system. Results This paper discusses how to utilize modern cryptography and block chain technology to establish a traceability system that could assure the security of epidemic information; design a distributed decision support system; solve the privacy-preserving problems of Federated Learning based on SGX technology, and present a group architecture to alleviate the performance cost of SGX. Conclusions The schemes above can help to achieve the security and traceability of epidemic information, also improve the automation and decision-making efficiency of the auxiliary information system for epidemic prevention and control.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
