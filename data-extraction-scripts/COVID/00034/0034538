Method This is a retrospective study. Serum samples were collected from 284 patients including outpatients and inpatients in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 20, 2020 to February 17, 2020. Among them 205 cases were 2019-nCoV infected patients, including 186 cases confirmed with nucleic acid test and 19 cases diagnosed by clinical symptoms and CT characteristics according to 'the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Control Protocol (5th edition)' . A total of 79 subjects with other diseases but negative to 2019-nCoV infection were recruited as control group. Serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV were measured with fully automated immunoassay technology for all subjects. Statistical significance between 2019-nCoV antibodies test and 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test was determined using the &chi; 2 tests. Result The sensitivity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV were 70.24%(144/205) and 96.10%(197/205) respectively and the specificity were 96.20%(76/79) and 92.41%(73/79) respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of 2019-nCoV antibodies were 95.63%(197/206) and 91.03% (71/78) respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were 100%(186/186) and 80.61%(79/98) respectively. The total coincidence rate of diagnosing 2019-nCoV infection between antibody tests and nucleic acid test for 2019-nCoV were 88.03%(250/284). Conclusion Joint detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV is an effective screening and diagnostic indicators for 2019-nCoV infection, and an effective complement to the false negative results to nucleic acid test.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
