The literature generally suggests that most health professionals’ knowledge of infection control principles and standards is poor or, at the very least, inadequate. There is a paucity of research examining paramedic knowledge of infection control principles and standards, particularly in the Australian pre-hospital context. The purpose of this study was to determine paramedic knowledge of standard infection control definitions and principles in an Australian emergency medical system (EMS). A confidential and anonymous mail survey was distributed to all paramedics working in a State-wide Australian ambulance service (n=2274) A total of 1258 surveys were returned - a response rate of 55.3%. Only 46.2% (n=581) of the participants identified the correct components of the ’chain of infection’. Correct identification of the definition of ’nosocomial’ was made by 27,9% (n=347) of participants. Less than one-fifth (17.2%, n=217) of participants identified 'standards and additional precautions’ as the current system of infection control. Less than half (41.6%, n=523) of the sample correctly identified hand washing as the primary’ infection control strategy’ to prevent cross-infection. This study suggests knowledge of fundamental principles and standards of infection control among paramedics is poor in this jurisdiction and recommends the introduction of comprehensive in-service education programmes in infection control. Further research is required to investigate if, and how, these results may be realised in practice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
