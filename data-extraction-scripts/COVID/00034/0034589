In this outbreak, Hunan Changde region immediately set up a hospital and intensive care unit. The patients relieved through respiratory support, hemodynamics management, nutritional support, the application of antiviral drugs, analgesic and sedation. The treatment experience in severe cases of 2019-nCov pneumonia patients were summarized as follows: in terms of respiratory support, we needed to pay attention to the advantages of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) and the intervention of mechanical ventilation, pay attention to the ventilator parameters, and adopt prone position timely. In the aspects of fluid resuscitation and volume management, we should pay attention to the characteristics of severe patients' volume status, perform early evaluation, and clinicians should focused on hemodynamic management beside the bed. In the aspect of nutritional support and evaluation and maintenance of intestinal function, early enteral nutrition should be adopted in time. However, the trade-off between the risk of intestinal function and nutritional support in patients with mechanical ventilation and the antiviral benefits of Kaletra needed to be reevaluated, the optimized way of analgesia and sedation was adopted, at the same time, the usage and side effects of antiviral drugs should be paid attention to. We should grasp the opportunity of transportation for severe patients. It is suggested that some warning scores should be used to facilitate early recognition of patients with severe infection and then they should be earlier transferred to the designated hospital for intensive care.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
