<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>First cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the WHO European Region, 24 January to 21 February 2020</TITLE><BODY>A cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1]. On 12 January 2020, Chinese authorities shared the sequence of a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolated from some clustered cases [2]. Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As at 21 February 2020, the virus had spread rapidly mostly within China but also to 28 other countries, including in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [3-5]. Here we describe the epidemiology of the first cases of COVID-19 in this region, excluding cases reported in the United Kingdom (UK), as at 21 February 2020. The study includes a comparison between cases detected among travellers from China and cases whose infection was acquired due to subsequent local transmission.%R doi:https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000178&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
