The study found that the COVID-19 not only attacks the respiratory system, but also affects other systems such as the heart, kidney, and digestive tract, and could be combined with multiple system diseases such as acute cerebrovascular disease. If doctors, especially non-infective or respiratory doctors, do not pay great attention to the patient when they are receiving patients, and take good care of them, they may easily cause their own infection. This article summarizes the case of a concealed onset COVID-19 patient with cerebral infarction, which caused a medical staff infection after intravenous thrombolytic therapy, explores its clinical characteristics, treatment process and analyzes its prevention and control links to help the epidemic situation. In the prevention and control, the first-time doctor should pay attention to identification, reduce missed diagnosis, and scientific investigation to reduce occupational infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
