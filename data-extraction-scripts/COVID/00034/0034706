This study evaluated the association between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality and deaths due to diabetes or renal disease in real-life clinical settings. Methods A clinical database in Hong Kong included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and grouped according to the initial antihypertensive prescription. The associations between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality or combined diabetes and renal mortality, respectively, were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard models. Results From 218,047 eligible patients, 33,288 (15.3%) died within five years after their first-ever antihypertensive prescription and among which 1055 patients (0.48%) died of diabetes or renal disease. After adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, service settings, district of residence, medication adherence, and the number of comorbidities, each drug class was similarly likely to be associated with mortality due to diabetes or renal disease [Adjusted Hazard Ratios (AHR) ranged from 0.92 to 1.73, p=0.287–0.939] and all-cause mortality (AHR ranged from 0.83 to 1.02) except for beta-blockers (AHR=0.815, 95% C.I. 0.68–0.87, p=0.024) when ACEI was used as a reference group in propensity score-adjusted analysis. Conclusions These findings provide real-life evidence reinforcing that any major antihypertensive drug class is suitable as a first-line agent for management of hypertension as recommended by international guidelines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
