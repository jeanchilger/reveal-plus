Relative to the better characterized sPLA2s (sPLA2-IB, -IIA, -V and -X), the enzymatic properties, distributions, and functions of these “new” sPLA2s have remained obscure until recently. Our current studies using knockout and transgenic mice for a nearly full set of sPLA2s, in combination with comprehensive lipidomics, have revealed unique and distinct roles of these “new” sPLA2s in specific biological events. Thus, sPLA2-IID is involved in immune suppression, sPLA2-IIE in metabolic regulation and hair follicle homeostasis, sPLA2-IIF in epidermal hyperplasia, and sPLA2-III in male reproduction, anaphylaxis, colonic diseases, and possibly atherosclerosis. In this article, we overview current understanding of the properties and functions of these sPLA2s and their underlying lipid pathways in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
