Methods A retrospective analysis of 91 NCP patients admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People&rsquo;s Hospital from January 22 to 30, 2020 was performed including 39 males and 52 females, with a median age of 50 (33-62) years, then their clinical features and HRCT characteristics were analyzed. Results The main clinical presentations included fever in 70 cases and cough in 57 cases(mainly dry coughin39 cases). The first time HRCT showed that 24 cases with NCP were normal, however other 67 cases were abnormal. The ground glass opacity in the lung on HRCT was found in 65 cases, including 64 cases with dilated blood vessel crossing the lesion, 50 cases with thickened adjacent pleura, and 47 cases with thickening of interstitial septum. The patchy opacity was seen in 42 cases, and no enlarged lymph nodes were observed in all patients. As for the lesion distribution, there were two cases with bilateral diffuse changes, 57 cases with multiple lesions, 8 cases with the lesion in only one lobe. The lesions were mainly located under the pleura area in 46 cases, including 39 cases in the lower lobe and other 7 cases in the upper lobe. And there were 13 cases without characteristic distribution in the lung. Conclusions The initial images of NCP in Guangzhou mainly showed multiple ground glass opacity, which were mostly seen in the subpleural and lower lung fields, most of them with thickened pulmonary interstitium. Guangzhou has a higher proportion of NCP patients with mild and general patients, and some confirmed patients show negative HRCT for the first time. Patients without HRCT changes should be reviewed in a timely manner.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
