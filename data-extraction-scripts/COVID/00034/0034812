IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine with an essential role in the development and proliferation of regulatory T cells, restricting myeloid and chronic inflammatory T cell responses. However, IL-10 is also essential for the expansion of antigen activated, tumor specific CD8(+) T cells, leading to spontaneous tumor development in IL-10 deficient patients and mice. IL-10 induces IFNγ and cytotoxic mediators in antigen activated T cells. In clinical trials, monotherapy with recombinant, pegylated IL-10 (Pegilodecakin) induced objective responses in cancer patients. Patients receiving pegilodecakin had a systemic increase of IFNγ and granzymes, proliferation and expansion of immune checkpoint positive CD8(+) T cells. Combination of pegilodecakin with anti-PD-1 appeared to improve on the efficacy of the single agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
