<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Functional Cell Receptors for Human Coronavirus</TITLE><BODY>Viruses infect host cells by binding to receptors on thesurface of cells. Receptor is an important factor affecting host range and interspecific transmission. In December 2019, an outbreak of unexplained pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province. The pathogen was a new coronavirus, named 2019 NovelCoronavirus (2019-nCoV) by WHO. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be the receptor of 2019-nCoV.This review provides a brief overview of human coronavirus receptors and their applications, with a view to providing references for the tracing, cross-species transmission, epidemiological analysis and antiviral and vaccine studies of 2019-nCoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
