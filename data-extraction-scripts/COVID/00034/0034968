METHODS Patients with septic myocardial injury were recruited, and were randomly divided into two groups: treatment group and control group. All patients in two groups received conventional cluster treatment, the patients in treatment group additional received Xuebijing injection dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride injection, and the patients in control group received the same amount of 0.9% sodium chloride injection. At the beginning of treatment and 3, 7 and 10-day after treatment, laboratory indicators of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were respectively tested in venous blood. The patient's length of stay in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the mortality in 28 days were recorded. RESULTS At 3, 7 and 10-day after treatment, the improvements of cTnI, NT-proBNP and PCT in treatment group were better than those in control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The mortality of treatment group in 28 days was not significantly different from that of control group (P > 0.05). The ICU length of stay of treatment group was shorter than that of control group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Xuebijing injection could improve the levels of cTnI, NT-proBNP and PCT in patients with septic myocardial injury. and it had a protective effect on myocardial injury.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
