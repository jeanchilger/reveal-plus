Though it is associated with infectious mononucleosis and over 200,000 cancers annually worldwide, a vaccine is not available. The major target of immunity is EBV glycoprotein 350/220 (gp350) that mediates attachment to B cells through complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21). Here, we created self-assembling nanoparticles that displayed different domains of gp350 in a symmetric array. By focusing presentation of the CR2-binding domain on nanoparticles, potent neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice and non-human primates. The structurally designed nanoparticle vaccine improved vaccine-induced protection in a mouse model by targeting a functionally conserved site of vulnerability with 10- to 100-fold increased neutralization compared to soluble gp350. This rational approach to EBV vaccine design elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses by focusing on a conserved viral entry domain, a strategy that can be applied to other viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
