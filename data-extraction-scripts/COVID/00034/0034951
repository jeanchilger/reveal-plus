Usually, disease agent (bacteria, virus) passes between individuals through these connections and an epidemic outbreak may occur. Here, complex networks models, like Erdös–Rényi, Small-World, Scale-Free and Barábasi–Albert will be used for modeling a population, since they are used for social networks; and the disease will be modeled by a SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model. The objective of this work is, regardless of the network/population model, analyze which topological parameters are more relevant for a disease success or failure. Therefore, the SIR model is simulated in a wide range of each network model and a first analysis is done. By using data from all simulations, an investigation with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is done in order to find the most relevant topological and disease parameters.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
