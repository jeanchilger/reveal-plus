China has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spreading of the disease. However, severe trauma can still occur in the NCP patients.

The consensus illustrated the classification of the NCP patients, severe trauma patients in need of emergency surgery, emergency surgery type, hierarchical protection for medical personnel and treatment places.
