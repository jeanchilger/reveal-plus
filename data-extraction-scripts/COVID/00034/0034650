Methods. A total of 62 NCP suspected patients admitted in 2020 were treated with TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment, as well as our hospital medical staff with No.1-4 hospital prescription. After taking traditional Chinese medicine, 16 out of 25 NCP suspected patients with phlegm heat stagnating lung syndrome were discharged to home for isolation observation, 4 patients hospitalized for observation, and 5 patients confirmed with NCP. For 15 patients with phlegm dampness accumulating lung syndrome, 7 patients were discharged to home for isolation observation, 3 patients were hospitalized for observation and 5 patients have been confirmed. For 18 patients with spleen stomach disharmony syndrome, 15 patients were discharged to home for isolation observation, 1 patient was hospitalized for observation and 2 patients have been confirmed. For 4 patients with Qi deficiency and dampness stagnation syndrome were discharged to home for isolation observation, 1 patient was hospitalized for observation, and two have been confirmed. The duration of taking traditional Chinese medicine was 1 to 20 days from admission to be discharged. The doctors and nurses who took the prescription of TCM for 12 to 15 days have been prevented from NCP infection. Conclusions. The clinical effect and the preventive effect of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment for NCP have been proved to be satisfactory. TCM can go into the primary hospital for treatment and prevention on NCP.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
