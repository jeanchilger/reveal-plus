In order to delineate the epitopes on H protein, fine epitope mapping and conservation analysis of linear B-cell epitopes (BCEs) on PPRV H has been undertaken using biosynthetic peptides and rabbit anti-PPRV H sera. Thirteen linear BCEs were identified and their corresponding minimal motifs were located on the H protein of PPRV China/Tibet/Geg/07-30. Conservation analysis indicated that two of the 13 minimal motifs were conserved among 52 PPRV strains. Nine of the 13 peptides containing the minimal motifs were recognized using anti-PPRV serum from a goat immunized with PPRV vaccine strain Nigeria 75/1. Identified epitopes and their motifs improve our understanding of the antigenic characteristics of PPRV H and provide a basis for the development of epitope-based diagnostic assays and multiple epitopes vaccine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
