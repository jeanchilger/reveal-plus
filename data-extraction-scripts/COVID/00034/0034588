Of them, one case visited for conjunctivitis as a first symptom and then diagnosed as NCP, and two cases visited for binocular conjunctivitis during the NCP onset. In 3 patients, conjunctivitis was manifested as signs of viral conjunctivitis from mild to moderate. Their symptoms of two patients disappeared after treatment with antiviral eyedrops for 7 to 10 days and another patient died of NCP. Interestingly,although we detected positive viral nucleic acid in the conjunctiva sacs of 2 of other 27 NCP patients by using swabs and RT-PCR technology, no conjunctivitis occurred in these two patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
