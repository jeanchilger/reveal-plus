<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>Two clinical cases of Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in renal transplant recipients</TITLE><BODY>Objective To explore the clinical features, diagnosis and prognosis of renal transplant recipients with NCP. Method The clinical data of 2 cases of kidney transplant recipients with NCP were retrospectively analyzed. Based onclinical manifestations, blood routine, inflammatory factors, cell immunity, chest CT andtherapeutic effects, the diagnosis and treatment of NCP in kidney transplant recipients (5th edition) were compared to that ofordinary NCP patients. Both recipients developed onset of low andmoderate fever, with no cough or fatigue at the initial stage. Blood routine indicated a normal range of leukocytes,buta significant decrease in lymphocyte counts, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) , and slightly higher procalcitonin (PCT) . The cellular immunity was extremely low, and the chest CT showed multiple patchy ground glass shadows in both lungs. Result After 1 week of onset, both patients had significant disease progression. The pathogenesis and imaging changes were highly similar tothatreported in ordinary NCP patients.Two patients were givensymptomatic supportive treatment by antiviral agents, stop uses ofimmunosuppression agents, small amount of hormone maintenance, intravenous drip of gamma globulin andrespiratory support toavoid secondary infections. At present, the condition of both patients is obviously improved, and renal function is stable. One of them has recovered and was discharged. Conclusion The clinical manifestations of NCP in renal transplant recipients were generally consistent with that of ordinary NCP patients. Although there is no established method for the treatment of NCP, it is effective by stopping uses of immunosuppressive agents, maintaining small and medium doses of hormones, actively restoring immunity, and providing respiratory support in a timely manner.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
