The prevalence of the CD14-159CC polymorphism was significantly higher in the patients with severe SARS than in the those with mild SARS or controls (31% versus 15% [mild SARS] or 20% [controls]; mild SARS: P = 0.029; odds ratio, 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 6.57; controls, P = 0.04; odds ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 5.54), and both CD14-159CC and FcγRIIA-RR131 are risk genotypes for severe SARS-CoV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
