<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Autopsy Biosafety: Recommendations for Prevention of Meningococcal Disease</TITLE><BODY>INTRODUCTION: As invasive meningococcal disease progresses rapidly, often affects youth, and has a fairly high mortality rate, such cases are likely to fall under medical examiner/coroner (ME/C) jurisdiction. Morgue personnel may be at risk of contracting secondary meningococcal disease. We review the current scientific literature regarding Neisseria meningitidis infection and provide recommendations for the prevention of meningococcal disease at autopsy. METHODS: A PubMed search utilizing applicable medical subject heading terms was performed retrieving articles for review from the preceding two decades. Pertinent current guidelines from multiple national organizations were also retrieved. RESULTS: Invasive meningococcal disease is transmitted by direct contact with large respiratory droplets or oral secretions. While a surgical mask would normally provide adequate protection from large droplet spread, it does not prevent inhalation of smaller aerosolized particles such as those generated at autopsy. Prosectors are advised to routinely wear N-95 respirator masks or powered respirator hoods. All published cases of secondary meningococcal disease transmission to healthcare workers invariably arose in scenarios in which face masks/respirators were not employed; none of these cases involved meningococcal disease transmission to ME/C or other morgue staff. DISCUSSION: In the event that no mask—or inadequate coverage such as a surgical mask—is employed during autopsy of a decedent suspected/confirmed to have invasive meningococcal disease, antibiotic prophylaxis is advisable. Assuming appropriate personal protective equipment is utilized, chemoprophylaxis is unnecessary. Routine meningococcal vaccination is not recommended, except for ME/C with specified immunocompromising conditions or traveling to hyperendemic/endemic meningococcal regions.
