<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-09-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Complete Genome Sequences of Two Chinese Virulent Avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis Virus Variants</TITLE><BODY>Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is variable, which causes many serotypes. Here we reported the complete genome sequences of two virulent IBV variants from China, GX-YL5 and GX-YL9, belonging to different serotypes. Differences between GX-YL5 and GX-YL9 were found mainly in stem-loop structure I in the predicted RNA secondary structure of open reading frame (ORF) 1b and the S protein gene fusion region, which will help us understand the molecular evolutionary mechanism of IBV and the disconcordance between the genotypes and serotypes of coronavirus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
