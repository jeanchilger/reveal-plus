There is increasing evidence that inflammatory factors undermine adequate Treg functions and homeostasis, resulting in prolonged and exacerbated inflammation. Therefore, identifying the factors is of the utmost important. IL-27 is an antiinflammatory cytokine implicated in immune regulation and tolerance. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying IL-27–mediated immune regulation in vivo remain largely unknown. Utilizing a cockroach antigen–induced allergic inflammation model in mice, we sought to test the roles of Tregs during IL-27–mediated regulation of allergic inflammation. Intranasally delivered IL-27 significantly reduced the development of airway inflammation. Unexpectedly, the IL-27–induced reduction occurred only in the presence of Tregs. Il27ra(–/–) and Treg-specific Il27ra(–/–) mice developed severe airway inflammation, and IL-27 treatment had little impact on diminishing the inflammatory responses. IL-27–induced treatment was restored following transfer of WT Tregs but not of Tregs deficient in Lag3, a molecule induced by IL-27 in Tregs. Finally, Tregs from asthmatic patients exhibited blunted STAT1 phosphorylation following IL-27 stimulation. Taken together, our results uncover that Tregs are the primary target cells of IL-27 in vivo to mediate its antiinflammatory functions, suggesting that altered IL-27 responsiveness in Tregs may underlie inadequate Treg functions and perpetuation of inflammation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
