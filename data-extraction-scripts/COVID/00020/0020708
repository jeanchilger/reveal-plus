Pertussis like illness (PLI) refers to a clinical syndrome compatible with pertussis infection but lacking laboratory confirmation or an epidemiological link to a confirmed case. Our study aimed to estimate the contribution of Bordetella pertussis infection and identifying predictors of its diagnosis in a cohort of children with PLI. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information were retrospectively collected from the medical records of children < 13 years old and hospitalized for PLI in two pediatric units in Oman from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013. The laboratory data of all cases were reviewed and confirmed cases of pertussis were identified, analyzed, and compared with non-confirmed cases. RESULTS: A total of 131 patients were enrolled in this study. The majority (95.4% [125/131]) were infants. Only 54.1% (71/131) of admitted children with PLI were tested for pertussis. The incidence of pertussis infection among the tested group was 16.9% (12/71) with a 95% confidence interval 8.2−25.6. Severe illness occurred in 56.4% (74/131) of patients, and six were confirmed to have pertussis. Pediatric intensive care unit admission was required for one confirmed case of pertussis and eight cases from the PLI group (three were negative for pertussis, and five were not tested). Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed that a white blood cell count (3) 23.5 × 10(9)/L had 96.6% specificity and lymphocytes (3) 17 × 10(9)/L had 98.3% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into consideration that the number tested for pertussis was limited, the incidence of pertussis was 16.9% (12 out of 71 patients). Lymphocytosis can be used as a reliable predictor for the diagnosis of pertussis especially in the absence of specific confirmatory tests or until their results are available.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
