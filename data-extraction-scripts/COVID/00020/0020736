The disease is characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea, and a high mortality rate (82.3%) in newborn piglets. The clinical appearance was similar to that of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection. PEDVs were detected in samples (feces or small intestines) from most farms. In order to investigate whether there is a PEDV variant circulating in China, we sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of the recently identified field strain, CH/FJND-3/2011. The sequence data indicate that this PEDV variant prevails in China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
