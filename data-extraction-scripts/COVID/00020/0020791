In turn, viruses have evolved a wide variety of strategies to hide from, and to directly antagonize, the host innate immune pathways. One of these pathways is the 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway. OAS is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to produce 2′-5′ oligoadenylates, which are the activators of RNase L; this enzyme degrades viral and cellular RNAs, restricting viral infection. It has been recently found that the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of rotavirus VP3 has a 2′-5′-phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity that is able to functionally substitute for the PDE activity of the mouse hepatitis virus ns2 protein. This particular phosphodiesterase cleaves the 2′-5′-phosphodiester bond of the oligoadenylates, antagonizing the OAS/RNase L pathway. However, whether this activity of VP3 is relevant during the replication cycle of rotavirus is not known. Here, we demonstrate that after rotavirus infection the OAS/RNase L complex becomes activated; however, the virus is able to control its activity using at least two distinct mechanisms. A virus-cell interaction that occurs during or before rotavirus endocytosis triggers a signal that prevents the early activation of RNase L, while later on the control is taken by the newly synthesized VP3. Cosilencing the expression of VP3 and RNase L in infected cells yields viral infectious particles at levels similar to those obtained in control infected cells, where no genes were silenced, suggesting that the capping activity of VP3 is not essential for the formation of infectious viral particles. IMPORTANCE Rotaviruses represent an important cause of severe gastroenteritis in the young of many animal species, including humans. In this work, we have found that the OAS/RNase L pathway is activated during rotavirus infection, but the virus uses two different strategies to prevent the deleterious effects of this innate immune response of the cell. Early during virus entry, the initial interactions of the viral particle with the cell result in the inhibition of RNase L activity during the first hours of the infection. Later on, once viral proteins are synthesized, the phosphodiesterase activity of VP3 degrades the cellular 2′-5′-oligoadenylates, which are potent activators of RNase L, preventing its activation. This work demonstrates that the OAS/RNase L pathway plays an important role during infection and that the phosphodiesterase activity of VP3 is relevant during the replication cycle of the virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
