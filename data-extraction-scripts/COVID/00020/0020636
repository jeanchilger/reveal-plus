<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-09-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Multifaceted Sequence-Dependent and -Independent Roles for Reovirus FAST Protein Cytoplasmic Tails in Fusion Pore Formation and Syncytiogenesis</TITLE><BODY>Fusogenic reoviruses utilize the FAST proteins, a novel family of nonstructural viral membrane fusion proteins, to induce cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation. Unlike the paradigmatic enveloped virus fusion proteins, the FAST proteins position the majority of their mass within and internal to the membrane in which they reside, resulting in extended C-terminal cytoplasmic tails (CTs). Using tail truncations, we demonstrate that the last 8 residues of the 36-residue CT of the avian reovirus p10 FAST protein and the last 20 residues of the 68-residue CT of the reptilian reovirus p14 FAST protein enhance, but are not required for, pore expansion and syncytium formation. Further truncations indicate that the membrane-distal 12 residues of the p10 and 47 residues of the p14 CTs are essential for pore formation and that a residual tail of 21 to 24 residues that includes a conserved, membrane-proximal polybasic region present in all FAST proteins is insufficient to maintain FAST protein fusion activity. Unexpectedly, a reextension of the tail-truncated, nonfusogenic p10 and p14 constructs with scrambled versions of the deleted sequences restored pore formation and syncytiogenesis, while reextensions with heterologous sequences partially restored pore formation but failed to rescue syncytiogenesis. The membrane-distal regions of the FAST protein CTs therefore exert multiple effects on the membrane fusion reaction, serving in both sequence-dependent and sequence-independent manners as positive effectors of pore formation, pore expansion, and syncytiogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
