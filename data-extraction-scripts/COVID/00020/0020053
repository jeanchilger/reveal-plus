By monitoring the effect of this peptide library on membrane leakage in model membranes, we have identified three regions on the SARS CoV spike glycoprotein with membrane-interacting capabilities: region 1, located immediately upstream of heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and suggested to be the fusion peptide; region 2, located between HR1 and HR2, which would be analogous to the loop domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1; and region 3, which would correspond to the pretransmembrane region. The identification of these membrane-active regions, which are capable of modifying the biophysical properties of phospholipid membranes, supports their direct role in SARS CoV-mediated membrane fusion, as well as facilitating the future development of SARS CoV entry inhibitors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
