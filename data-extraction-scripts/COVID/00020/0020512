<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-07-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Epidemiology of Human Metapneumovirus</TITLE><BODY>Since the discovery of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 2001, the virus has been identified worldwide. hMPV is a common respiratory pathogen, particularly in infants and young children. The virus is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and may be a trigger for asthma. At least two major genotypes of hMPV circulate during community outbreaks. Whether these genotypes represent distinct serotypes remains controversial. The major challenges faced by the medical and scientific communities are the understanding of the pathogenesis of hMPV disease and the development of a safe and effective vaccine to protect against infection and disease caused by this newly recognized respiratory virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
