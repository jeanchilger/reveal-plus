The most promising inhibitors from this group are selective for cathepsin L and demonstrate IC(50) values in the low nanomolar range. In nearly all cases, the thiochromanone sulfide analogues show superior inhibition of cathepsin L as compared to their corresponding thiochromanone sulfone derivatives. Without exception, the compounds evaluated were inactive (IC(50) > 10000 nM) against cathepsin B. The most potent inhibitor (IC(50) = 46 nM) of cathepsin L proved to be the 6,7-difluoro analogue 4. This small library of compounds significantly expands the structure–activity relationship known for small molecule, nonpeptidic inhibitors of cathepsin L.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
