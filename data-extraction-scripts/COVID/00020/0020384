<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-11-25</DATELINE><TITLE>A highly prevalent and genetically diversified Picornaviridae genus in South Asian children</TITLE><BODY>Viral metagenomics focused on particle-protected nucleic acids was used on the stools of South Asian children with nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). We identified sequences distantly related to Seneca Valley virus and cardioviruses that were then used as genetic footholds to characterize multiple viral species within a previously unreported genus of the Picornaviridae family. The picornaviruses were detected in the stools of >40% of AFP and healthy Pakistani children. A genetically diverse and highly prevalent enteric viral infection, characteristics similar to the Enterovirus genus, was therefore identified substantially expanding the genetic diversity of the RNA viral flora commonly found in children.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
