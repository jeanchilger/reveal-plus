<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-10-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Preparation of Benzalkonium Salts Differing in the Length of a Side Alkyl Chain</TITLE><BODY>Benzalkonium salts are widely used as disinfectants, biocides and detergents, among a variety of other applications. The cationic surface-activity of these salts determines their potential to act as a biocide on both target and non-target organisms. In this study, a quick synthesis of a complete set of the benzalkonium salts differing in the length of an alkylating chain (from C(2) to C(20)) is described. Moreover, their (1)H-NMR, HPLC-MS, TLC and HPLC analysis were recorded.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
