Four major structural proteins were characterized in the present study: two glycosylated proteins with estimated molecular masses of 42 and 50 kDa, one 66-kDa phosphoprotein, and one 22-kDa protein. Examination of lysed virions revealed the two glycoproteins and the 22-kDa protein in the soluble fraction, while the 66-kDa phosphoprotein and a minor part of the 22-kDa protein were found in the pelleted fraction. Immunofluorescence staining of infected cells demonstrated that the 22-kDa protein was a late protein accumulating in the nucleus. We conclude that the 66-kDa protein is the nucleoprotein, the 22-kDa protein is the matrix protein, and the 42- and 50-kDa proteins are the surface proteins. Radioimmunoprecipitation analysis of the 42-kDa glycoprotein, which was previously shown to represent the ISAV hemagglutinin, indicated that this protein exists at least as dimers. Further, by labeling of purified ISAV with [1,3-(3)H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate, it was also demonstrated that the viral esterase is located with the hemagglutinin. This finding was confirmed by demonstration of acetylesterase activity in affinity-purified hemagglutinin preparations. Finally, the active-site serine residue could be tentatively identified at position 32 within the amino acid sequence of the hemagglutinin of ISAV strain Glesvaer/2/90. It is proposed that the ISAV vp66 protein be termed nucleoprotein, the gp42 protein be termed HE protein, and the vp22 protein be termed matrix protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
