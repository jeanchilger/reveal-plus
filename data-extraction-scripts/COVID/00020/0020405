<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-05-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Evaluation of SSYA10-001 as a Replication Inhibitor of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Mouse Hepatitis, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses</TITLE><BODY>We have previously shown that SSYA10-001 blocks severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication by inhibiting SARS-CoV helicase (nsp13). Here, we show that SSYA10-001 also inhibits replication of two other coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A putative binding pocket for SSYA10-001 was identified and shown to be similar in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and MHV helicases. These studies show that it is possible to target multiple coronaviruses through broad-spectrum inhibitors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
