To mediate their physiologic function, interferons evoke a robust and complex signal transduction pathway that leads to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes with both proinflammatory and anti-viral function. Numerous mechanisms exist to tightly regulate the extent and duration of these cellular responses. Among such mechanisms, the post-translational conjugation of ubiquitin polypeptides to protein mediators of interferon signaling has emerged as a crucially important mode of control. In this mini-review we highlight recent advances in our understanding of these ubiquitin-mediated mechanisms, their exploitation by invading viruses and their possible utilization for medical intervention.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
