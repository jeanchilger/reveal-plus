ER stress is a common consequence in coronavirus-infected cells. However, how the virus-induced ER stress influences coronavirus replication and pathogenesis remains controversial. Here, we demonstrated that infection with the alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) induced ER stress and triggered the unfolded protein response (UPR) in vitro and in vivo, and ER stress negatively regulated TGEV replication in vitro. Although TGEV infection activated all three UPR pathways (activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6], inositol-requiring enzyme 1 [IRE1], and protein kinase R-like ER kinase [PERK]), the virus-triggered UPR suppressed TGEV replication in both swine testicular (ST) and IPEC-J2 cells primarily through activation of the PERK-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) axis, as shown by functional studies with overexpression, small interfering RNA (siRNA), or specific chemical inhibitors. Moreover, we demonstrated that PERK-eIF2α axis-mediated inhibition of TGEV replication occurs through phosphorylated eIF2α-induced overall attenuation of protein translation. In addition to direct inhibition of viral production, the PERK-eIF2α pathway activated NF-κB and then facilitated type I IFN production, resulting in TGEV suppression. Taken together, our results suggest that the TGEV-triggered PERK-eIF2α pathway negatively regulates TGEV replication and represents a vital aspect of host innate responses to invading pathogens. IMPORTANCE The induction of ER stress is a common outcome in cells infected with coronaviruses. The UPR initiated by ER stress is actively involved in viral replication and modulates the host innate responses to the invading viruses, but these underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We show here that infection with the alphacoronavirus TGEV elicited ER stress in vitro and in vivo, and the UPR PERK-eIF2α branch was predominantly responsible for the suppression of TGEV replication by ER stress. Furthermore, the PERK-eIF2α axis inhibited TGEV replication through direct inhibition of viral proteins due to global translation inhibition and type I IFN induction. These findings highlight a critical role of the UPR PERK-eIF2α pathway in modulating host innate immunity and coronavirus replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
