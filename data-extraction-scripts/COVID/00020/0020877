<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-03-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Potential Point-of-Care Testing for Dengue Virus in the Field</TITLE><BODY>The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) cause one of the most important and rapidly emerging mosquito-borne viral diseases in humans. Of the currently available diagnostic tests for dengue, the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay is the most sensitive and specific, and so it is commonly used as the gold standard. However, the requirement of a sophisticated and expensive thermal cycler makes it very difficult to use as a point-of-care diagnostic test in resource-limited regions where dengue is endemic. Tsai et al. (J Clin Microbiol 56:e01865-17, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01865-17) report the analytical and clinical performances of a reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay with a portable nucleic acid analyzer for rapid detection of the four DENV serotypes; its reproducibility and complete agreement on clinical samples with the multiplex RT-PCR assay developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the dengue RT-iiPCR is a potential point-of-care test. Compared with other DENV RNA detection methods, the unique isothermal PCR design of RT-iiPCR, together with further improvements, would represent a promising new type of field-deployable diagnostic test for dengue.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
