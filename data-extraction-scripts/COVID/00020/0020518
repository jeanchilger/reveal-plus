To characterize the duck immune response to influenza, we sought to identify innate immune genes expressed early in an infection. We used suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) to construct 3 libraries enriched in differentially expressed genes from lung RNA of a duck infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), or lung and intestine RNA of a duck infected with low pathogenic avian influenza A/mallard/BC/500/05 (H5N2) compared to a mock-infected duck. Sequencing of 1687 clones identified a transcription profile enriched in genes involved in antiviral defense and other cellular processes. Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), interferon induced protein with tricopeptide repeats 5 (IFIT5), and 2′–5′oligoadenylate synthetase-like gene (OASL) were increased more than 1000-fold in relative transcript abundance in duck lung at 1 dpi with highly pathogenic VN1203. These genes were induced much less in lung or intestine following infection with low pathogenic BC500. The expression of these genes following infection suggests that ducks initiate an immediate and robust response to a potentially lethal influenza strain, and a minimal response a low pathogenic strain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
