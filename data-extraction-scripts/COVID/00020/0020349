CEACAM2 possesses adhesive and signaling properties mediated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. In this study, we demonstrate that CEACAM2 is expressed on the surface and in intracellular pools of platelets. Functional studies of platelets from Ceacam2(−/−)-deficient mice (Cc2(−/−)) revealed that CEACAM2 serves to negatively regulate collagen glycoprotein VI (platelet) (GPVI)-FcRγ–chain and the C-type lectinlike receptor 2 (CLEC-2) signaling. Cc2(−/−) platelets displayed enhanced GPVI and CLEC-2–selective ligands, collagen-related peptide (CRP), collagen, and rhodocytin (Rhod)-mediated platelet aggregation. They also exhibited increased adhesion on type I collagen, and hyperresponsive CRP and CLEC-2–induced α and dense granule release compared with wild-type platelets. Furthermore, using intravital microscopy to ferric chloride (FeCl(3))–injured mesenteric arterioles and laser-induced injury of cremaster muscle arterioles, we herein show that thrombi formed in Cc2(−/−) mice were larger and more stable than wild-type controls in vivo. Thus, CEACAM2 is a novel platelet immunoreceptor that acts as a negative regulator of platelet GPVI-collagen interactions and of ITAM receptor CLEC-2 pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
