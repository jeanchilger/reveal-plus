A substantial amount of literature has been generated that advances our understanding of the relationship between mitophagy and several viruses. Some viruses trigger mitophagy directly, and indirectly and control the mitophagic process via different strategies. This enables viruses to promote persistent infection and attenuate the innate immune responses. In this review, we discuss the events of virus-regulated mitophagy and the functional relevance of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of viral infection and disease.
