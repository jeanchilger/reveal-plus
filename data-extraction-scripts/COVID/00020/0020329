Due to the continuing burden on human health, the need for new tools to study influenza virus pathogenesis as well as to evaluate new therapeutics is paramount. We report the development of a stable, replication-competent luciferase reporter influenza A virus that can be used for in vivo imaging of viral replication. This imaging is noninvasive and allows for the longitudinal monitoring of infection in living animals. We used this tool to characterize novel monoclonal antibodies that bind the conserved stalk domain of the viral hemagglutinin of H1 and H5 subtypes and protect mice from lethal disease. The use of luciferase reporter influenza viruses allows for new mechanistic studies to expand our knowledge of virus-induced disease and provides a new quantitative method to evaluate future antiviral therapies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
