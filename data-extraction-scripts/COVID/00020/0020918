However, the promise of this approach in humans is hampered by serious concerns over the risk of leaking live severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses. In this study, we generated a SARS vaccine candidate by using the live-attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a vector. The full-length SARS-CoV envelope Spike (S) glycoprotein gene was introduced into the deletion III region of the MVA genome. The newly generated recombinant MVA, ADS-MVA, is replication incompetent in mammalian cells and highly immunogenic in terms of inducing potent neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and monkeys. After two intramuscular vaccinations with ADS-MVA alone, the 50% inhibitory concentration in serum was achieved with reciprocal sera dilutions of more than 1,000- to 10,000-fold in these animals. Using fragmented S genes as immunogens, we also mapped a neutralizing epitope in the region of N-terminal 400 to 600 amino acids of the S glycoprotein (S400-600), which overlaps with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding region (RBR; S318-510). Moreover, using a recombinant soluble RBR-Fc protein, we were able to absorb and remove the majority of the neutralizing antibodies despite observing that the full S protein tends to induce a broader spectrum of neutralizing activities in comparison with fragmented S proteins. Our data suggest that a major mechanism for neutralizing SARS-CoV likely occurs through blocking the interaction between virus and the cellular receptor ACE2. In addition, ADS-MVA induced potent immune responses which very likely protected Chinese rhesus monkeys from pathogenic SARS-CoV challenge.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
