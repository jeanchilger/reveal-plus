In pancreatic cells, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) hijacks membranes from the autophagy pathway, and in vivo disruption of acinar cell autophagy dramatically delays CVB3 replication. This is reversed by expression of GFP-LC3, indicating that CVB3 may acquire membranes from an alternative, autophagy-independent, source(s). Herein, using 3 recombinant CVB3s (rCVB3s) encoding different proteins (proLC3, proLC3(G120A), or ATG4B(C74A)), we show that CVB3 is, indeed, flexible in its utilization of cellular membranes. When compared with a control rCVB3, all 3 viruses replicated to high titers in vivo, and caused severe pancreatitis. Most importantly, each virus appeared to subvert membranes in a unique manner. The proLC3 virus produced a large quantity of LC3-I which binds to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), affording access to the autophagy pathway. The proLC3(G120A) protein cannot attach to PE, and instead binds to the ER-resident protein SEL1L, potentially providing an autophagy-independent source of membranes. Finally, the ATG4B(C74A) protein sequestered host cell LC3-I, causing accumulation of immature phagophores, and massive membrane rearrangement. Taken together, our data indicate that some RNA viruses can exploit a variety of different intracellular membranes, potentially maximizing their replication in each of the diverse cell types that they infect in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
