The nucleocapsid is an essential structural protein with conserved functions across the coronavirus family. While a multitude of studies have examined nucleocapsid function, none have described the effects of OC43 nucleocapsid on the transcription factor NF-κB. We report that the nucleocapsid protein of OC43 causes potentiation of NF-κB activation. This prolonged activation is the direct result of the ability of the nucleocapsid to bind RNA, specifically microRNA 9 (miR-9), which is a negative regulator of NF-κB. This previously undescribed interaction between virus and host is a potential mechanism of immune evasion in RNA viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
