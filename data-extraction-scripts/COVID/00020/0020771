The TLR5 agonist flagellin was deemed to be a mucosal adjuvant candidate for clinical usage. However, the high antigenicity of flagellin and the possible inflammatory injury induced by flagellin might restrict its clinical usage. Here HIV-1 p24 protein was selected as an antigen model and we replaced the main antigenicity region domains D2 and D3 of non-pathogenic E.coli-derived flagellin (KF). The derived soluble protein KFD-p24 3D was then compared with KF-p24, which fused p24 directly to the C-terminal of KF. In vitro and ex vivo experiments showed that KFD-p24 3D has lower TLR5 agonist efficacy and less immunocyte-activating efficacy. Interestingly, the production of KF- specific antibody was highly reduced, and KFD-p24 3D induced IgA-biased antibody responses in mucosal sites. Moreover, KFD-p24 3D induced far fewer systemic inflammatory responses and abrogated detectable inflammatory side effects on mice, even at the high dose. The properties of enhanced IgA generation and attenuated inflammatory responses broaden the safe-dose range of KFD-p24 3D flagellin, creating a potentially promising mucosal adjuvant.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
