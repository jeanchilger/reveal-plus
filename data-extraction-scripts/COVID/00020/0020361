These mice could be used as models to explore the possibilities of producing rHMAbs for therapeutic purposes. The highest concentration of the rHMAb in the milk of the transgenic females was 6.6 mg/ml. The rHMAb was also detected in the sera of pups fed by the transgenic females. Both the rHMAbs in the milk of transgenic mice and those in the sera of suckling pups were found to be active against hantaviruses, although the light chain of the antibody absorbed by the pups was modified by N-linked glycosylation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
