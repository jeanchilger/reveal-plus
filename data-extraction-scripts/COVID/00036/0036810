In this study, a hunnivirus was detected in fecal samples collected from a diarrheic cat in Southern China in 2017. Genome sequencing and analysis indicated that the novel hunnivirus has the same genome organization as reported for other hunniviruses, 5′UTR-L-P1(VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1)-P2(2A-2B-2C)-P3(3A-3B-3Cpro-3Dpol)-3′UTR, but is genetically divergent. This hunnivirus is proposed as a novel genotype of the species Hunnivirus A and provisionally designated feline hunnivirus. Our study expands the host range of hunnivirus and enriches knowledge on picornaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
