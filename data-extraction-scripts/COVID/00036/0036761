The objectives of this retrospective study were to report our experience of intraoperative adverse events (IOAEs) during fenestrated and branched stent grafting and to analyze the impact on clinical outcomes. Methods Consecutive patients treated with fenestrated and branched stent grafting in a tertiary vascular center between February 2006 and October 2013 were evaluated. A prospectively maintained computerized database was scrutinized and updated retrospectively. Intraoperative angiograms were reviewed to identify IOAEs, and adverse events were categorized into three types: target vessel cannulation, positioning of graft components, and intraoperative access. Clinical consequences of IOAEs were analyzed to ascertain whether they were responsible for death or moderate to severe postoperative complications. Results During the study period, 113 consecutive elective patients underwent fenestrated or branched stent grafting. Indications for treatment were asymptomatic complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs, n = 89) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs, n = 24). Stent grafts included fenestrated (n = 79) and branched (n = 17) Cook stent grafts (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind), Ventana (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) stent grafts (n = 9), and fenestrated Anaconda (Vascutek Terumo, Scotland, UK) stent grafts (n = 8). In-hospital mortality rates for the CAAA and TAAA groups were 6.7% (6 of 89) and 12.5% (3 of 24), respectively. Twenty-eight moderate to severe complications occurred in 21 patients (18.6%). Spinal cord ischemia was recorded in six patients, three of which resolved completely. A total of 37 IOAEs were recorded in 34 (30.1%) patients (22 CAAAs and 12 TAAAs). Of 37 IOAEs, 15 (40.5%) resulted in no clinical consequence in 15 patients; 17 (45.9%) were responsible for moderate to severe complications in 16 patients, and five (13.5%) led to death in four patients. The composite end point death/nonfatal moderate to severe complication occurred more frequently in patients with IOAEs compared with patients without IOAEs (20 of 34 vs 12 of 79; P < .0001). Conclusions In this contemporary series, IOAEs were relatively frequent during branched or fenestrated stenting procedures and were often responsible for significant complications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
