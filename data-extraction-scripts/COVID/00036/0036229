Recent investigations have shown that for some viruses the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies and other organelles are heavily recruited into virus-induced perinuclear structures. These structures are not isolated organelles and are dynamically connected to the bulk of non-modified endomembranes. They also have a functional link with peripheral motile vesicles involved in virus intracellular movement. The full molecular events that consubstantiate with this endomembrane recruitment in virus-induced structures remain to be elucidated but viral genome replication and virion assembly are probably taking place within these structures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
