<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1976-04-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Inclusion Bodies in Tracheobronchial Epithelium of Asymptomatic Subjects</TITLE><BODY>During a survey conducted for the cytodiagnosis of early bronchogenic carcinoma, cytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies were found sporadically in tracheobronchial smears of asymtomatic patients of both sexes (ages ranging from 18 to 80 years) undergoing general endotracheal anesthesia for surgery. A review of 3,049 cases performed to assess the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon showed a 1.1 percent incidence in all smears studied. There was no relationship between smoking habit, age, or sex and the presence of inclusion bodies; however, there was a marked seasonal incidence, with 60 percent of inclusion-bearing smears being found during the months of January through March.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
