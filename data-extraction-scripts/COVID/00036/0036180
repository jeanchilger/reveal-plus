<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-11-30</DATELINE><TITLE>RABBITS</TITLE><BODY>This chapter provides an overview of the biology and medical care of rabbits. There are about 50 different breeds of domestic rabbits. Rabbits have very thin and delicate skin that is covered with fine fur comprised of both a soft undercoat and stiff guard hairs. Care must be taken when clipping fur because the skin is prone to tearing. A rabbit enclosure should be large enough to provide a sleeping space, eating space, and latrine. Animals housed for long periods of time should also have ample room to exercise. The enclosure should be tall enough to allow the rabbit to sit up and not have its ears touch the top of the cage. Because rabbits are prone to heatstroke, they should be housed in temperatures ranging from 60°F to 75°F. If rabbits are housed outdoors, they must have access to shade and clean water, and the shelter should protect them from the elements as well as from predators. The ideal substrate for rabbits is grass hay; however, for indoor, caged rabbits, a foam rubber pad or a towel covered with newspaper and a thick layer of timothy hay can also be used.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
