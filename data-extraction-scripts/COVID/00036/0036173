The rGO/Au nanohybrid was prepared by the one-pot hydrothermal method and well characterized by different physiochemical techniques. The nanohybrid exhibits a weak fluorescence of rGO due to the energy transfer from the rGO to Au NPs. The rGO/Au nanohybrid shows enhanced fluorescence activity due to the restoration of quenched fluorescence of rGO/Au nanohybrid in presence of L-Cys. The rGO/Au nanohybrid exhibits much lower detection limit of 0.51 nM for L-Cys with higher selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism arose from the fluorescence recovery due to the stronger interaction between Au NPs and L-Cys, and consequently, the energy transfer was prevented between rGO and Au NPs. The practicability of rGO/Au sensor was implemented by invitro bioimaging measurements in Colo-205 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) and MKN-45 (gastric carcinoma) cancer live cells with excellent biocompatibility.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
