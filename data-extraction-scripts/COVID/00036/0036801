<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Collaborative Antimicrobial Stewardship Working with Microbiology</TITLE><BODY>There have been tremendous advances in methodologies available for detection and identification of organisms causing infections. Providers can now obtain identification results and antimicrobial susceptibility results in a shorter period of time. However, declining health care resources highlight the importance of selecting the right test at the right time to maximize diagnostic benefits.

This review focuses on the experience of our group in collaborative stewardship, emphasizing successes and challenges.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
