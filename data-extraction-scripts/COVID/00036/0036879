In this study, a quartz crystal microbalance-based immunosensor (QCM) has been developed and its potential evaluated for the rapid and sensitive detection of both influenza A and B viruses in laboratory-cultured preparations and clinical samples. The effective limit for detection by QCM for stock preparations of both A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 viruses was 1×104 pfu/mL, associated with observed frequency shifts of 30 (±5) and 37 (±6.5)Hz, respectively. Conjugation of 13nm gold nanoparticles to the detecting antibody improved the mass sensitivity of the immunosensor, resulting in a 10-fold increase in sensitivity and a detection limit of 1×103 pfu/mL for both preparations, with resulting frequency shifts of 102 (±11) and 115 (±5)Hz, respectively. Detection of virus in nasal washes with this technique was achieved by overnight passage in MDCK cultures prior to analysis. A comparison of results obtained from 67 clinical samples using existing RT-PCR, shell vial, cell culture and ELISA methods showed that QCM techniques were comparable in sensitivity and specificity to cell culture methods.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
