However, effective therapy for SVC is still scarce until now. Here we evaluated the inhibition of anisomycin (Ani), a metabolite produced by Streptomyces griseolus, on the replication of SVCV in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that Ani could suppress SVCV replication with the maximum inhibitory rate > 95% in epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. And the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of Ani on SVCV glycoprotein (G), nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein mRNA expressions were 21.79, 13.13 and 12.24 nM, respectively. Besides, Ani decreased SVCV-induced cytopathic effects and nucleus damages. As expected, Ani also showed a strong anti-SVCV activity in vivo, as indicated by inhibiting viral gene expression and increasing the survival rate of zebrafish. Intraperitoneal injection of Ani increased the survival rate of zebrafish by 30% and markedly inhibited the expressions of G and N mRNA by > 60% in kidney and spleen at day 1 and day 4 post-infection. Results so far suggest that Ani as a powerful agent against SVCV can be applied to the control of SVC in aquaculture.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
