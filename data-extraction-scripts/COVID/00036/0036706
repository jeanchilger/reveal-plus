However, it is less clear whether and how BST2 inhibits the release of enveloped viruses which bud via the secretory pathway. Here, we demonstrated that BST2 restricts the release of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) whose budding occurs at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and in turn, JEV infection downregulates BST2 expression. We further found that the JEV envelope protein E, but not other viral components, significantly downregulates BST2 with the viral protein M playing an auxiliary role in the process. Envelope protein E-mediated BST2 downregulation appears to undergo lysosomal degradation pathway. Additional study revealed that the transmembrane domain and the coiled-coil domain (CC) of BST2 are the target domains of viral protein E and that the N- and C-terminal membrane anchors and the CC domain of BST2 are essential for blocking JEV release. Our results together indicate that the release of enveloped viruses whose budding take place in an intracellular compartment can be restricted by BST2.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
