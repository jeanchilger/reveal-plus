Unlike other immunologically active polysaccharides, inulin has no immune activity in its native soluble form, but when crystallized into the stable delta inulin isoform, it acquires potent immune actions. Most notably, delta inulin enhances both humoral and cellular immune responses against vaccine antigens, translating into enhanced protection against a broad range of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and toxin-mediated diseases. Delta inulin is distinct compared with typical vaccine adjuvants as it does not require adsorption to antigen and does not appear to work through induction of inflammatory danger signals. Delta inulin manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (referred to as Advax) has been proved to be safe and effective in human trials of influenza vaccines, hepatitis B vaccines, and insect sting allergy vaccines. Advax thereby represents a novel nonreactogenic immune modulator with potential utility across a broad range of human prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
