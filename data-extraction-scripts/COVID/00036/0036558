In this study, recombinant baculoviruses, rBac-NF and rBac-NG, were generated to express F and G proteins of NiV. The expressions of recombinant G (rNG) and F (rNF) proteins in rBac-NF and rBac-NG-infected cells were confirmed by Western blot. Both rNG and rNF showed sensitive and specific antigenic reaction to rabbit serum anti-Nipah virus in indirect immunofluorescence detection and indirect ELISA. Immunization with rBac-NF and rBac-NG-infected insect cells elicited G and F protein-specific antibody responses in mice. Furthermore, the G and F protein-specific antibodies could neutralize the infectivity of the VSVΔG*F/G, the NiV F and G envelope glycoproteins of pseudotype recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus expressing green fluorescence protein. The results demonstrated that the F and G proteins expressed by the recombinant baculoviruses could be safe diagnostic antigens for the surveillance and monitoring of NiV and could also be promising subunit vaccines for the prevention of NiV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
