Here, we describe a novel approach for siRNA cellular delivery using siRNA encapsulated into liposomes additionally bearing arginine octamer (R8) molecules attached to their outer surface (R8-liposomes). The R8-liposomal human double minute gene 2 (HDM2)-siRNA demonstrated a significant stability against degradation in the blood serum (siRNA-loaded R8-liposomes remained intact even after 24-h incubation), and higher transfection efficiency into all three tested lung tumor cell lines. siRNA delivery successfully proceeds in the presence of plasma proteins, and R8-liposomes demonstrate low non-specific toxicity. The mechanism of action of R8-liposome-encapsulated siRNA is associated with the RNAi-mediated degradation of the target mRNA. siRNA in R8-liposomes effectively inhibited the targeted gene and significantly reduced the proliferation of cancer cells. The approach offers the potential for siRNA delivery for various in vitro and in vivo applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
