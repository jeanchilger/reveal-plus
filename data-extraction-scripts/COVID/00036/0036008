In this review, evidence is discussed, which show that in a subset of multiple sclerosis patients the central nervous system (CNS) lesions show profound similarities to tissue alterations found in acute white matter stroke, thus suggesting that a hypoxia-like metabolic injury is a pathogenetic component in a subset of inflammatory brain lesions. Both, vascular pathology as well as metabolic disturbances induced by toxins of activated macrophages and microglia may be responsible for such lesions in multiple sclerosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
