Thiophosphonates S-PMEA 3 and S-PMPA 4 were evaluated for in vitro activity against HIV-1 (subtypes A to G), HIV-2 and HBV-infected cells, and found to exhibit potent antiretroviral activity. We showed that their diphosphate forms S-PMEApp 5 and S-PMPApp 6 are readily incorporated by wild-type (WT) HIV-1 RT into DNA and act as DNA chain terminators. Compounds 3 and 4 were evaluated for in vitro activity against a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses and displayed beside HIV a moderate activity against herpes simplex virus and vaccinia viruses. In order to measure enzymatic stabilities of the target derivatives 3 and 4, kinetic data and decomposition pathways were studied at 37 °C in several media.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
