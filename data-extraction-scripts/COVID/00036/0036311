High-throughput, multiplex polymerase chain reaction is the most commonly used qualitative detection method, but utilisation of newer techniques such as next-generation sequencing will become more common following significant cost reductions. Rapid and readily accessible isothermal amplification platforms have also allowed molecular diagnostics to be used in a ‘point-of-care’ format. This review focuses on the current applications and limitations of molecular diagnosis for respiratory viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
