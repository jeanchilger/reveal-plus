<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>An animal model that reflects human disease: the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)</TITLE><BODY>The common marmoset is a new world primate belonging to the Callitrichidae family weighing between 350 and 400g. The marmoset has been shown to be an outstanding model for studying aging, reproduction, neuroscience, toxicology, and infectious disease. With regard to their susceptibility to infectious agents, they are exquisite NHP models for viral, protozoan and bacterial agents, as well as prions. The marmoset provides the advantages of a small animal model in high containment coupled with the immunological repertoire of a nonhuman primate and susceptibility to wild type, non-adapted viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
