Design Systematic review. We searched electronic databases and reference lists published between 1967 and 2018, restricted to non-accidental cases. Results Forty-four studies including 489 participants aged 1 day to 17 years from 13 countries were included. Cultural, medical, and behavioural rationale for oil-use was described. The clinical-radiological presentation varied widely. Diagnostic certainty was deemed highest if ELP was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage/frozen section lung biopsy with documented extracellular lipid on cytological staining and/or fat analysis. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection was identified in six studies: Mycobacterium fortuitum/chelonei, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium abscessus. Treatment comprised supportive therapy, corticosteroids, stopping oil, therapeutic lung-lavage and surgical resection. Outcomes were reported inconsistently. Conclusion Paediatric ELP resulting from cultural and medical practices continues to be described globally. Preventive interventions, standardized reporting, and treatment efficacy studies for cases not averted, are lacking. Protocol registration: PROSPERO CRD42017068313.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
