Each recombinant baculovirus expressed both glycosylated (S, 170K; S1, 95K; S2, 80K) and unglycosylated (S0, 140K; S10, 75K; and S20, 65K) forms of BCV spike polypeptides in Sf9 cells. The mature 95K S1 polypeptide was secreted whereas the S and S2 polypeptides remained cell-associated. The S precursor was partially cleaved in Sf9 cells, and the resulting S1 was also released into the medium. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies representing two antigenic domains bound to recombinant S and S1 but not the S2 polypeptides, indicating that two major epitopes for BCV neutralization are located on the S1 subunit.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
