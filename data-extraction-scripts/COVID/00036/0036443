<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-11-30</DATELINE><TITLE>New concepts and approaches for drug discovery based on traditional Chinese medicine</TITLE><BODY>In this review, we report a new reverse approach (from finding bioactive molecules to separating target compounds in the related plant) by using virtual screening, immobilized enzyme and polyclonal antibody, molecularly imprinted polymers for finding, and separating the active compounds from TCM. This approach is faster and more efficient than the traditional time-consuming approach (from selecting the plant to separating compounds following the bioassay guidance).
