METHODS: Of 343 patients who met the World Health Organization’s case definition of probable SARS and who had been admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong, 201 patients had laboratory evidence of SARS coronavirus infection. The initial frontal chest radiographs of these 201 patients were assessed in a blinded fashion by 3 radiologists; individual findings were accepted if at least 2 of the radiologists concurred. Independent predictors of an adverse outcome, defined as the need for assisted ventilation, death, or both, were identified by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Bilateral disease and involvement of more than two zones on the initial chest radiograph were associated with a higher risk of liver impairment and poor clinical outcome. Forty-two patients (21%) developed an adverse outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that lung involvement of more than two zones (odds ratio [OR] = 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7 to 17.9), older age (OR for each decade of life = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.0), and shortness of breath on admission (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1 to 7.4) were independent predictors of an adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: Frontal chest radiographs on presentation may have prognostic value in patients with SARS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
