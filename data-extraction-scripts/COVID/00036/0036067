The most obvious difference could be found in expression of the surface protease aminopeptidase N (AP N/CD13). Whereas monoclonal antibodies specific to CD13 failed to reveal surface expression on lymphocytes of the PB; 63 ± 15% of SF T cells gave positive staining for CD 13 using Leu-M7. No correlation between CD13 expression and joint disease could be found in patients who had different types of inflammatory joint effusions. CD13 expression of T cells was also found in synovial tissue and inflammatory serous cavity effusions. Fixation of T cells revealed the presence of intracellular CD13 antigen already located in the PB T cells of healthy individuals. Induction of CD13 expression on PB T cells could be demonstrated after incubation with Con A/IL-2 or SF from patients with RA. Our findings suggest a role for AP N as a new activation-associated molecule of T lymphocytes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
