Sensors are distributed everywhere in smart cities. They can be employed to monitor health care, transportation, infrastructure, building, surveillance, government, etc. Especially, nanosensors hold great impact to turn the current techniques for the detection of viruses. With the facility of real-time sensing, there is no need for regular inspections for maintenance and surveying, which results in reduced costs and time wastage. Definitely, common sensing platforms need persistent updates to address increasing doubts in the detection of viruses as they modify quickly and spread from person to person, pointing the urgency of early detection. In this chapter the introduction is briefly described in Section 30.1. The fundamental of nanosensors is explained in Section 30.2. The significance and applications of nanosensors in virus detection are extensively discussed in Sections 30.3 and 30.4. Section 30.5 consists of various challenges and outlook.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
