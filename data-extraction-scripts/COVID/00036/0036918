Fifty five multiparous cows, stabled in the same farm, were randomly divided in three groups; cows of Group A were dressed on their back with deltamethrin, cows of Group B remained untreated within the same pen and cows of Group C remained untreated in a separate pen. Clinical records of the herd showed a history of clinical and subclinical mastitis (especially during spring and early summer) and fly infestation. Deltamethrin reduced fly population, landing on the cows of Group A, facilitating a significant decrease of S. aureus, coagulase negative staplylococci, E. coli intramammary infections and somatic cell count, throughout the study period. Consequently, there is a relationship between fly abundance and transmission of bacteria resulting in intramammary infections and mastitis in dairy cows. The use of the pyrethroid deltamethrin reduced fly abundance and therefore, the possibility of transmitting pathogenic bacteria in the mammary gland.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
