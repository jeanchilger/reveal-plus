Methods Patient records of confirmed H1N1 influenza were analyzed at three geographic aggregation levels together with population census statistics. Results The study confirmed that four population factors were related in different degrees to disease incidence, but the results varied according to spatial resolution. The degree of association actually decreased when data of a higher spatial resolution were used. Conclusions We concluded that variables at suitable spatial resolution may be useful in improving the predictive powers of models for disease outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
