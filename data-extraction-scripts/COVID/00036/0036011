<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-01-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Management of Infection in Patients With Kidney Transplant</TITLE><BODY>With the pervasive nature of chronic kidney disease, kidney transplantation is likely to continue to increase in the coming years. There are many infectious risks related to kidney transplant, including reactivation of latent infections, surgical complications, infectious risks related to immunosuppression, and nosocomial and community-acquired infections. These are described classically via timeline with early infections (first month), middle (1 to 6 months), and late (after 6 months). Kidney transplant patients may suffer from infections secondary to a vast array of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Certain infections, particularly viral infections such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and BK virus, may portend acute and chronic implications of the infection and its subsequent impact on graft function. Critical care physicians and nephrologists caring for patients with a renal transplant must understand the broad array of possible infections, atypical presentations, and nuanced implications for appropriate evaluation and subsequent therapy, combined with the need for possible prophylaxis and/or suppression. Multidisciplinary teams, including transplant physicians and infectious diseases physicians, are encouraged strongly.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
