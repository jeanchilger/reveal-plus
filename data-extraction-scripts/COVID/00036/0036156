Distinct characteristics of microchip electrophoresis (MCE) are discussed first, in which sample injection plug, joule heat, channel turn, surface adsorption and modification are introduced, and some successful strategies and recognized conclusions are also included. Important achievements of microfluidic electrophoresis separation in small molecules, DNA and protein are then summarized. This review is aimed at researchers, who are interested in MCE and want to adopt MCE as a functional unit in their integrated microsystems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
