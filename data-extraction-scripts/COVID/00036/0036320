<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 18 Marine Metabolites Oceans of Opportunity</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The marine environment provides an array of compounds often with unique molecular architectures boasting an equally wide array of bioactivities including anticancer, antiinflammatory, and antimicrobial activity. Typically without the benefit of folklore therapeutic knowledge, marine organisms are collected, extracted, and fractionated to afford compounds that undergo evaluation with in vivo and in vitro assays en route to clinical applications. The pharmaceutical industry has benefited from research into marine metabolites with the development of marine-derived drugs including cytarabine, vidarabine, and ziconotide along with the more recently developed formulation Carragelose, an antiviral spray. Cosmetic applications incorporating marine extracts include Abyssine and RefirMAR. Research with macroinvertebrates, macroalgae, and microorganisms continue in the hope that drugs of the future will be culled from the oceans of the world. While obtaining a consistent and adequate supply of the bioactive compounds remains a challenge to be overcome, synthetic methods are being employed along with the application of biotechnological techniques to ensure that the drugs, when developed, will be in sufficient quantities for distribution to those who are in need.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
