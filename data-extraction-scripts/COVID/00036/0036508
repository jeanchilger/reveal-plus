<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>cGAS and CD-NTase enzymes: structure, mechanism, and evolution</TITLE><BODY>Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) is a signaling enzyme in human cells that controls immune-sensing of cytosolic DNA. The recent discoveries of diverse structural homologs of cGAS in animals and bacteria reveal that cGAS-like signaling is surprisingly ancient and widespread in biology. Together with the Vibrio cholerae protein dinucleotide cyclase in Vibrio (DncV), cGAS and DncV homologs comprise a family of cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzymes that synthesize noncanonical RNA signals including cyclic dinucleotides, cyclic trinucleotides, and linear oligonucleotides. Structural and biochemical breakthroughs provide a framework to understand how CD-NTase signaling allows cells to respond to changing environmental conditions. The CD-NTase family also includes uncharacterized human genes like MB21D2 and Mab21L1, highlighting emerging functions of cGAS-like signaling beyond innate immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
