In total, 2895 outbreaks of the disease have been reported by the veterinary authorities of Greece; sheep, goats and cattle were affected with officially reported morbidity rates of 11.0%, 2.0% and 3.5%, respectively. No vaccinations were allowed and conservative measures were implemented to attempt to limit the disease, which at the end had expanded throughout the country. In field investigations, a significantly higher bluetongue morbidity rate (27.5%) in sheep has been reported. During that work, clinical anaemia was encountered, which was characterised as macrocytic, hypochromic, regenerative and non-haemolytic. Other investigations, which are reviewed in this paper, have described an outbreak of Citrobacter freundii-associated enteritis in newborn kids, offspring of goats subclinically infected with Bluetongue virus, increased rate of early embryonic deaths, reduced conception rates, increased incidence risk of mastitis and reduced milk yield in herds of subclinically-infected cattle and detection of the virus from hunter-harvested tissue samples of roe-deer. In 2015, vaccines against the disease have been licenced; vaccinations started in May 2015. Then, in 2015, only one outbreak of the disease was confirmed, which could have been the result of a combination of reasons acting concurrently to prevent further cases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
