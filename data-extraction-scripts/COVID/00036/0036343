It may cause acute respiratory failure ranging from severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to exacerbations of airflow limitation. Non-invasive ventilation is now considered first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure and may be considered in the context of H1N1 pandemic. Although infection control issues have been arisen, non-invasive ventilation was effective and safe during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. It is reasonable to recommend non-invasive ventilation in H1N1-related exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, especially in negative-pressure wards. Treatment of early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with H1N1 using non-invasive ventilation could be tried rapidly identifying those who fail without delaying endotracheal intubation. Considering the high demand for critical care beds during the pandemic, non-invasive ventilation may have a role in reducing the estimated load.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
