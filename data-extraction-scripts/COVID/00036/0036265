However, the lncRNA expression and potential functions in porcine endemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection and host defense are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the lncRNA expression profiles during PEDV infection in intestinal porcine epithelial cell-jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell lines by next-generation sequencing and identified 6188 novel lncRNAs. The functional annotation analysis revealed that these lncRNAs might be associated with many immunity-related genes. We next selected candidate lncRNAs related to immune response pathways and further identified their differential expression in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells and newborn piglets. Our results demonstrated that PEDV infection regulated lncRNA expression patterns in both the IPEC-J2 cell line and piglet ileum. These findings provide the first large-scale survey of lncRNAs associated with PEDV infection, specifically the lncRNAs responsible for the activation of the immune system within the ileum.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
