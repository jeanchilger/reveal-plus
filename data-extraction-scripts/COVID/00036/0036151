<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-05-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Looking for Cryptosporidium: the application of advances in detection and diagnosis</TITLE><BODY>The protozoan Cryptosporidium is a major public and animal health concern. Young children, immunocompromised people, and pre-weaning animals are especially vulnerable, but treatment options are limited and there is no vaccine. A laboratory diagnosis is required to confirm cases of cryptosporidiosis, and species and genotype determination is essential in distinguishing human from non-human sources, understanding transmission, and strengthening the epidemiological evidence for causative links in outbreaks. However, testing is not consistent, as demonstrated by investigation of a significant increase in cases in some European countries during 2012. Many methods employed are laborious and time-consuming; recent advances, translated into diagnostic assays, can improve testing and facilitate typing to support clinical and environmental investigations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
