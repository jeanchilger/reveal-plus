Such oligonucleotides were subsequently eluted from the gels and their nucleotide sequences determined. When oligonucleotide probes of those sequences were synthesized and used in a dot-blot hybridization assay, the probes lacked IBV strain-specificity and reacted with the RNAs of homologous as well as heterologous IBV strains. Based on these results, the methods used in this study need to be applied to a large number of oligonucleotide probes, to find one or a few that might be suitable as IBV strain- or serotype-specific oligonucleotide probes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
