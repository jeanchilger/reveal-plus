Infecting C57BL/6 mice with Plasmodium berghei K173 strain (PbK) resulted in pulmonary oedema, capillaries congested with leukocytes and infected red blood cells (iRBCs), and leukocyte infiltration into the lungs. This new model of malaria-associated lung pathology, without any accompanying cerebral complications, allows the investigation of mechanisms leading to the lung disease. The activity of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in alveolar epithelial cells is decreased by several respiratory tract pathogens and this is suggested to contribute to pulmonary oedema. We show that PbK, a pathogen that remains in the circulation, also decreased the activity and expression of ENaC, suggesting that infectious agents can have indirect effects on ENaC activity in lung epithelial cells. The reduced ENaC activity may contribute to the pulmonary oedema induced by PbK malaria.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
