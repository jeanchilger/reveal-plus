This study analyzed a large collection of the Spike protein coding gene to infer the spatial-temporal diffusion history of PEDV. The studying results suggested that PEDVs in Korea belonged to different genogroups. While classical G1 was continuingly circulating between provinces of Korea, the pandemic G2a were recently introduced from China and USA. By the application of Bayesian phylogeographical analysis, this study demonstrated the spatial-temporal transmission of PEDVs within Korea. Of the recent emerged G2a viruses, J3142 strains showed potential recombination breakpoint (376–2,143nt) of S1 gene between KNU1303_Korea strain_G2a (KJ451046) and 45RWVCF0712_Thailand strain_G2b (KF724935). The pandemic G2a virus was partial neutralized by the antibodies invoked by the G1- based PED vaccine virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
