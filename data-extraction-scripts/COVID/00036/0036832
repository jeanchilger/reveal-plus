This experiment evaluated the effects of BRD incidence on subsequent finishing performance, efficiency, carcass characteristics, and lung scores of steers. Crossbred steers (n = 516) were monitored daily for clinical signs of BRD (BRD attributed morbidity and mortality were 66.5 and 13.2%, respectively). A subset of calves (n = 174) were grouped by the number of times treated for BRD (BRDX) and randomly allocated to finishing pens. The BRDX experimental groups included never treated for BRD (0X; 8 pens) and treated 1 time (1X; 8 pens), 2 times (2X; 8 pens), or 3 or 4 times (3/4X; 8 pens). Arrival BW was not different among BRDX groups (P = 0.17); however, BRDX during the receiving period decreased performance, resulting in BW of 324, 316, 285, and 260 kg for 0X, 1X, 2X, and 3/4X, respectively, at the start of finishing (P < 0.001). Ultrasound estimates, BW, and visual appraisal were used to target a common body composition (average days on feed = 182). With increasing BRDX, days on feed increased linearly (P = 0.002), whereas HCW, DP, rib eye area, QG, and unconsolidated lungs decreased linearly (P ≤ 0.03). These results suggest that with additional days on feed, calves treated multiple times for BRD are able to reach similar compositional endpoints as their untreated cohorts; however, it may not be possible for these calves to reach the same QG and carcass yield.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
