However, the number of cumulative cases is keeping upward, including the severe cases and death cases. It has been proved that droplets transmission is the major route for 2019-nCov infection, and interpersonal contact could also cause the disease. Due to the fast-growing of Wuhan pneumonia and relative low cure rate, Chinese government is facing great challenges, and has taken emergency measures on disease prevention and clinical treatment, including population mobility control, building five or more hospitals for Wuhan pneumonia treatment, such as "Huo Shen Shan" hospital as well as developing a specific vaccine. In the meanwhile, the government shared the updated Genome Sequence of 2019-nCoV to the public, and scientists from China and oversea are working tightly and efficiently on public health emergency.
