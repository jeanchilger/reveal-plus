Secondary objectives included measuring the effect of anti-IL-10 antibodies on calf health, performance, and shedding of less common diarrheal pathogens. A total of 133 calves, enrolled at 24 – 72 h of age, received a daily dose of 0.96 gm of egg yolk powder with anti-IL-10 antibodies (MAB, n = 71) or without anti-IL-10 antibodies (MEP, n = 62) split between 2 feedings for the first 11 d on feed at a calf ranch. Daily health evaluations were completed for 15 days after arrival and on d 56. Digital weights were collected at enrollment and d 56 and hipometer weights at enrollment, d 7 and 56. Packed cell volume and serum total protein concentration were measured at enrollment, d 7 and 14. Fecal pH was measured at enrollment, d 5 and 14, and fecal pathogen (C. parvum, coronavirus, rotavirus, and Salmonella spp) shedding was assessed at d 5 and 14. Continuous outcomes were compared between groups using a student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Fecal pathogen shedding at d 14, respiratory disease at d 56, and antibiotic usage were compared using relative risk and chi square test. Fecal pH (median, IQR) on d 14 was 6.65 (6.39 – 6.99) and 6.52 (5.97 – 6.81) for MAB and MEP, respectively. On d 56, the risk of respiratory disease was lower for MAB compared to MEP (RR: 0.40; CI: 0.16 – 0.99). The risk for antibiotic treatment was lower for MAB compared to MEP treated calves (RR = 0.38; CI: 0.17 – 0.88). The risk of shedding rotavirus was higher in MAB (RR = 1.38; CI: 1.10 – 1.81) calves. After multivariable analyses, hipometer weights (LSM ± SE) were 1.7 ± 0.8 kg greater on d 56 in MAB compared to MEP; however ADG was 0.04 ± 0.02 kg/d lower in MAB calves. Total health score, diarrhea days, average respiratory score, packed cell volume, and serum total protein were not affected by feeding anti-IL-10 egg antibodies. In summary, feeding anti-IL-10 antibodies was associated with increased fecal pH, reduced risk of respiratory disease later in the preweaning period, and decreased antibiotic usage despite higher rotavirus infection. These findings might be associated with improved mucosal immunity, enhanced host defenses, or reduced susceptibility and warrant further investigation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
