<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-08-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Connecting viral with cellular interactomes</TITLE><BODY>Genome-scale screens for intraviral and virus–host protein interactions and the analysis of literature-curated datasets are able to provide a novel, comprehensive perspective of viruses, and virus-infected cells. Until now, large-scale interaction screens were predominantly performed with the yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) system; however, alternative high-throughput technologies detecting binary protein interactions or protein complexes have been developed. Although many of the previous studies suffer from a rather poor validation of the results and few biological implications, these technologies potentially lead to a plethora of novel hypotheses. Here, we will give an overview of current approaches and their technical limitations, present recent examples and novel developments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
