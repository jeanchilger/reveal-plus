The amastigote stage of the parasite infects phagocytes and modulates the effector function of the host cells. Our group has described that the interaction between Leishmania and immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) takes place through dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), a C-type lectin that specifically recognizes fungal, viral and bacterial pathogens. The DC-SIGN-mediated recognition of Leishmania amastigotes does not induce DC maturation, and the DC-SIGN ligand/s on Leishmania parasites is/are still unknown. We have also found that the DC-SIGN-related molecule L-SIGN, specifically expressed in lymph node and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, acts as a receptor for L. infantum, the parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis, but does not recognize L. pifanoi, which causes the cutaneous form of the disease. Therefore, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN differ in their ability to interact with Leishmania species responsible for either visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis. A deeper knowledge of the parasite-C-type lectin interaction may be helpful for the design of new DC-based therapeutic vaccines against Leishmania infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
