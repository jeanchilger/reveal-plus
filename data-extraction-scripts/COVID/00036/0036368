Therefore infections by RNA viruses are a major threat to human health. The infected host cell detects trace amounts of viral RNA and the last years have revealed common principles in the biochemical mechanisms leading to signal amplification that is required for mounting of a powerful antiviral response. Components of the RNA sensing and signaling machinery such as RIG-I-like proteins, MAVS and the inflammasome inducibly form large oligomers or even fibers that exhibit hallmarks of prions. Following a nucleation event triggered by detection of viral RNA, these energetically favorable and irreversible polymerization events trigger signaling cascades leading to the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, mediated by interferon and NF-κB pathways. Viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate these host cell signaling pathways in order to ensure their replication. We will discuss at the examples of influenza and HTLV-1 viruses how a fascinating diversity of biochemical mechanisms is employed by viral proteins to control the NF-κB pathway at all levels.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
