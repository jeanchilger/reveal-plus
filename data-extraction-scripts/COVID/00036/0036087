However, multiple limitations, such as large size, complex structure and sensitivity to extreme ambient temperature potentially weaken the performance of mAbs in certain applications. To address this problem, the exploration of new antigen binders is extensively required in relation to improve the quality of current diagnostic platforms. In recent years, a new immunoglobulin-based protein, namely variable domain of new antigen receptor (VNAR) was discovered in sharks. Unlike conventional mAbs, several advantages of VNARs, include small size, better thermostability and peculiar paratope structure have attracted interest of researchers to further explore on it. This article aims to first present an overview of the shark VNARs and outline the characteristics as an outstanding new reagent for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
