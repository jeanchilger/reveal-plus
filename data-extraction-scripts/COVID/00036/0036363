<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 4 Virus Replication</TITLE><BODY>Abstract To continue the chain of infection, a virus must undergo the process of replication to create new, infectious virions that are able to infect other cells of the body or subsequent hosts. After gaining entry into the body, a virus makes physical contact with and crosses the plasma membrane of a target cell. Inside, it releases and replicates its genome while facilitating the manufacture of its proteins by host ribosomes. How this is carried out depends upon the type of viral nucleic acid. Virus particles are assembled from these newly synthesized biological molecules and become infectious virions. Finally, the virions are released from the cell to continue the process of infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
