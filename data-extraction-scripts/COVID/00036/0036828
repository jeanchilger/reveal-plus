Objective This study aims to assess whether a rapid and automated HBoV1 antigen test is suitable for diagnosis of acute HBoV1 infection. Study design HBoV1 antigen detection has been compared with quantitative HBoV1 DNA PCR and HBoV1 mRNA RT-PCR. Results and conclusion We conclude that HBoV1 antigen detection has higher clinical specificity and positive predictive value than HBoV1 DNA qualitative PCRs, yet a lower sensitivity than HBoV1 mRNA detection. Additionally, HBoV1 antigen detection is beneficial in its rapidity and availability as a point-of-care test.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
