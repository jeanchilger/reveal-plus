To guide the diagnostic and treatment plan, consideration of endemic and emerging infections in the region of travel, as well as careful review of the travelers’ exposures and preventative measures are necessary. Routine laboratory tests and cultures cannot confirm many tropical infections, and pathogen directed testing is typically required.

Providers should also be vigilant for rare but highly pathogenic emerging infections such as Ebola virus disease and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
