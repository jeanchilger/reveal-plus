However, identification of infectious agents in severe pneumonia remains a major challenge so far. In this study, the potential utility of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in detecting nonbacterial pathogens in patients with severe pneumonia was retrospectively evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 106 patients diagnosed with severe pneumonia at our hospital from September 2015 to December 2017 were included, and their baseline clinical characteristics were collected. Nonbacterial infectious agents detected by TEM in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serological tests were summarized. The detection rates were further compared between TEM and serological tests. RESULTS: BALF examination under the transmission electron microscope revealed 24 viruses, 16 mycoplasmas, 18 chlamydia, 2 fungi and 74 bacteria in 99 samples, among which 61 samples were mixed infections. The combined use of serological tests and TEM significantly improved the detection rate of nonbacterial infectious agents in patients with severe pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that implementation of TEM could improve the sensitivity for detecting viruses, atypical pathogens and mixed infections in BALF from patient of severe pneumonia. Therefore, TEM may be used as an auxiliary diagnostic method of other microbiological tests in severe pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
