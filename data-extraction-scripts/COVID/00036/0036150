<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-11-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Nanodiagnostics in Microbiology and Dentistry</TITLE><BODY>This chapter presents a general overview of nanodiagnostics in microbiology and dentistry. Nanodiagnostics uses biosensor technology which is one of the most promising, compact systems consisting of a composite analysis of biological recognition element. Detecting an analyte (glucose, antibiotics, etc.) using a transducer element or detector element to quantify the amount of analyte is the working principle of biosensors. The transducer or the detector element transforms the signal resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into another signal that can be more easily measured and quantified. Nanobiotechnology scientists have also successfully produced microchips that are coated with biological molecules. The chip is designed to emit an electrical impulse signal when the molecules detect signs of a disease. Special sensor nanobots can be inserted into the blood under the skin where they can check blood contents and warn of any possible diseases. They can also be used to monitor the sugar level in the blood. Advantages of using such nanobots are that they are very cheap to produce and are easily portable.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
