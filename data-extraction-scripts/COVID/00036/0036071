This chapter includes blood products for which hemovigilance is in force, and allows the reader to stay up to date on newly recognized and published data in the blood product arena. Since blood and plasma products are available through blood donation, prevention of transmitted infections is of extreme importance and is also discussed here.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
