Here, the carboxy-terminal charge-rich motif in the endodomain was verified to be critical for the specificity of S assembly into mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Recombinant MHVs exhibited a range of abilities to accommodate the homologous S endodomains from the betacoronaviruses bovine coronavirus and human SARS-associated coronavirus, the alphacoronavirus porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and the gammacoronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus respectively. Interestingly, in TGEV endodomain chimeras the reverting mutations resulted in stronger S incorporation into virions, and a net gain of negatively charged residues in the charge-rich motif accounted for the improvement. Additionally, MHV S assembly could also be rescued by the acidic carboxy-terminal domain of the nucleocapsid protein. These results indicate an important role for negatively charged endodomain residues in the incorporation of MHV S protein into assembled virions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
