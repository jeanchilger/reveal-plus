This material worked as an immobilisation and transduction surface. A 30-mer sequence that encodes a short lysine-rich region, unique to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, was chosen as target. A complementary strand (probe), labelled with a thiol group at the 3′-end, was immobilised on the film. After blocking the surface, hybridisation with the biotin-conjugated SARS strand (at the 3′-end) took place. Interaction with alkaline phosphatase-labelled streptavidin permits amplified indirect electrochemical detection. The analytical signal is constituted by an electrochemical process of indigo carmine, the soluble product of the enzymatic hydrolysis of 3-indoxyl phosphate. The use of a sensitive electrochemical technique such as square wave voltammetry allowed a detection limit of 6pM to be obtained for this DNA sequence, lower than any other found in the bibliography. The parameters affecting the methodology were studied, with special attention being placed on selectivity. Specificity was clearly enhanced when interaction time and stringency (in the form of formamide percentage) were increased. With 1h of strand interaction and employing 50% of formamide in the hybridisation buffer, a 3-base mismatch strand was perfectly distinguished from the complementary.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
