METHOD: A purposive sampling method was used and 10 nurses were selected from the first Chinese anti-Ebola medical team that was dispatched to Sierra Leone. Data were collected via phone and semi-structured interviews, then analyzed using Colaizzi's seven-step method. RESULTS: The data showed three major themes: (1) The causes of stress during the Sierra Leone aid mission mainly related to unsafety, responsibility, and unfamiliarity; (2) Physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms were documented; (3) Nurses experienced relief from stress after the mission. CONCLUSION: Targeted measures, proper responses and good community support can effectively lower stress among nurses on anti-Ebola missions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
