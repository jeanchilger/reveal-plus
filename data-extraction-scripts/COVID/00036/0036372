In this study we demonstrate that the Q939↓S940 peptide bond, located between the polymerase and Zn-finger regions of pp1ab (the POL↓Zn site), is processed by the 3CLpro, albeit inefficiently. Mutagenesis of the POL↓Zn site, as well as the previously identified HD1↓3C site in the 1a region of pp1a and pp1ab, demonstrated that the amino acid residues at the P2 and P1 positions of the cleavage site, occupied by L and Q, respectively, were important determinants of 3CLpro substrate specificity. Finally, a direct comparison of the 3CLpro-mediated cleavages at the HD1↓3C and POL↓Zn sites was made by determining the rate constants using synthetic peptides. The results show that while a larger polypeptide substrate carrying the HD1↓3C site was processed more efficiently than a polypeptide substrate carrying the POL↓Zn site, cleavage of the synthetic peptide substrates containing these two cleavage sites occurred at similar efficiencies. This indicates that the overall conformation of a large polyprotein substrate is important in the accessibility of the cleavage site to the proteinase.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
