The serum levels of DcR3 and its TNF-like ligand TL1A and homologous decoy receptor OPG were quantified by ELISA. The values of DcR3 to diagnose sepsis were analyzed by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results showed that DcR3 was significantly elevated in sepsis compared to SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), a condition similar to sepsis but resulting from noninfectious insults. DcR3 showed superior area under the ROC curve (AUC, 0.958) compared to poor AUCs of TL1A and OPG. At a cut-off of 3.24 ng/ml, DcR3 predicted sepsis from SIRS with 96% sensitivity and 82.6% specificity. DcR3 also predicted sepsis from cancer and inflammatory bowel disease with equally excellent values. Therefore, DcR3 serum level has the potential to serve as a reliable biomarker of sepsis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
