Case 1 showed delayed symptom development after a four-day asymptomatic period, Case 2 experienced a 20-day incubation period, and Case 3 exhibited persistent viral shedding without clinical deterioration. Recognizing these exceptions is extremely important in the management of MERS-CoV-exposed or -infected patients and for control of potential MERS outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
