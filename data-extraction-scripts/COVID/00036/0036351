Other posttranslational modifications of HSV1 glycoproteins (designated gB, gC, gD and gE) were related temporally to the discrete shifts in electrophoretic mobilities that signal acquisition of the O-linked oligosaccharides. Fatty acid acylation (principally of gE) could be detected just prior to the shifts, whereas conversion of high-mannosetype N-linked oligosaccharides to the complex type occurred coincident with the shifts. The addition of O-linked oligosaccharides did not occur in cells treated with the ionophore monensin or in a ricinresistant cell line defective in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides. We conclude that extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chains on HSV1 glycoproteins, and probably also attachment of the first O-linked sugars, occurs as a late posttranslational modification in the Golgi apparatus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
