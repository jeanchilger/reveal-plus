Before the release of its genome into the host cell cytoplasm, viruses operate a complex sequence of events that take place at the plasma membrane of the target cell. The first step is the binding of the HIV protein envelope (Env) to the cellular receptor CD4. This triggers conformational changes of the gp120 viral protein that allow its interaction with a co-receptor that can be either CCR5 or CXCR4, defining the tropism of the virus entering the cell. This sequential interaction finally drives the fusion of the viral and host cell membrane or to the endocytosis of the viruses. Here, we discuss how the membrane composition and organization of both the virus and the target cell can affect these steps and thus influence the capability of the viruses to infect cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
