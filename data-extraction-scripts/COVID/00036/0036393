<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-06-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Antimicrobial Nanostructures for Neurodegenerative Infections: Present and Future Perspectives</TITLE><BODY>Nanostructures have been widely involved in changes in the drug delivery system. Nanoparticles have unique physicochemical properties, e.g., ultrasmall size, large surface area, and the ability to target specific actions. Various nanomaterials, like Ag, ZnO, Cu/CuO, and Al(2)O(3), have antimicrobial activity. Basically, six mechanisms are involved in the production of antimicrobial activity, i.e., (1) destruction of the peptidoglycan layer, (2) release of toxic metal ions, (3) alteration of cellular pH via proton efflux pumps, (4) generation of reactive oxygen species, (5) damage of nuclear materials, and (6) loss of ATP production. Nanomedicine contributes to various pharmaceutical applications, like diagnosis and treatment of various ailments including microbial diseases. Furthermore, nanostructured antimicrobial agents are also involved in the treatment of the neuroinfections associated with neurodegenerative disorders. This chapter focuses on the nanostructure and nanomedicine of antimicrobial agents and their prospects for the possible management of infections associated with neurodegenerative disorders.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
