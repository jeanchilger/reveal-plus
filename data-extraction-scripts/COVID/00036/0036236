<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-02-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Bat Migration</TITLE><BODY>This article summarizes current knowledge about the migratory behavior of temperate and tropical bats. A close association between migration and hibernation exists in temperate, but not in tropical, bats. Compared with birds, bats are relatively short-distance migrators, with maximum migration distances being <2000 km; intercontinental migration is likely to be uncommon in bats. Migratory bats have lower levels of population subdivision and larger genetically effective population sizes than nonmigratory bats. A variety of methods, including banding, genetic analyses, stable isotope analyses, and tracking with radio or satellite transmitters, are currently being used to study bat migration. The conservation of migratory bats poses special challenges that require national and international efforts. Migratory bats sometimes harbor pathogens that can be transmitted to humans. Overall, the beneficial aspects of migratory bats, including control of insect populations and dispersal of pollen and seeds over broad areas, far outweigh their negative aspects.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
