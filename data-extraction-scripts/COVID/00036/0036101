<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-03-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Rotavirus incidence in hospitalised Hong Kong children: 1 July 1997 to 31 March 2011</TITLE><BODY>Sentinel laboratory surveillance from one hospital and passive discharge diagnosis (Clinical Management System, CMS) data from all public Hospital Authority (HA) hospitals were used to estimate disease burden and incidence of rotavirus in hospitalised Hong Kong children over 14 rotavirus seasons (1 July 1997 to 31 March 2011). A primary diagnosis of a gastroenteritis-related disorder was noted in 9.8% of children aged below 5 years, and a primary or secondary diagnosis in 11.8%. Any CMS diagnosis of rotavirus (ICD 008.61) was initially used to derive incidence estimates of rotavirus by age group. Rotavirus was recorded as any primary or any secondary diagnosis in 1.6% of children below 5 years of age. The unadjusted incidence rates per 100,000 person-years based on any CMS diagnosis of rotavirus were: 249 (0 to <1m); 612 (1 to <2m); 1066 (2 to <6m); 1383 (6 to <11m); 959 (1 to <2y); 406 (2 to <3y); 233 (3 to <4y); 124 (4 to <5y). Overall the rotavirus incidence was 1071 in children below 2 years and 542 in children below 5 years of age, with the incidence rates trending up during the time period (p = 0.001). A similar but less marked upward trend (p = 0.046) was noted for the incidence of all-cause gastroenteritis. Laboratory results from a single surveillance hospital (1 July 2000 to 31 March 2011) were then linked to these CMS codes to derive adjustment factors for possible over- and under-diagnosis of rotavirus based on CMS codes alone. This analysis suggested that a CMS diagnosis of rotavirus alone likely under-reported true incidence by a factor of between 1.59 and 2.02 in children below 5 years of age. Despite the availability of rotavirus vaccines in the private sector since 2006, no reduction in the incidence of hospitalisation for either rotavirus or all-cause gastroenteritis was noted in Hong Kong children below 5 years of age over 14 rotavirus seasons (1997–2011).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
