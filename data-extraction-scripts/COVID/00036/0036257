<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Long-term sequelae of SARS in children</TITLE><BODY>Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) runs a more benign course in children during the acute phase. Unlike adult patients, no fatalities were reported among the paediatric SARS patients. Published data on long-term sequelae of SARS are very limited. In our follow-up study, although patients have clinically recovered from their initial illness, exercise impairment and residual radiological abnormalities were demonstrated at 6 months after diagnosis. It is important to assess these patients on a regular basis to detect and provide appropriate management for persistent or emerging long-term sequelae in the physical, psychological and social domains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
