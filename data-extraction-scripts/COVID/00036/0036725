The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of bacterial and viral coinfection in patients with CAP. A total of 235 adults who requested molecular tests of pneumonia and were diagnosed with CAP were enrolled in this study. Microbiological tests included blood and sputum cultures, PCR for bacterial and viral pathogens, antigen test for Streptococcus pneumoniae and the influenza virus, and antibody detection of Mycoplasma pneumonia. Of the 235 patients, 32 (13.6%) patients were coinfected with bacteria and virus. Among 64 severe CAP patients, the concurrent infections were confirmed in 14 patients (21.9%). The proportion of severe pneumonia was significantly higher in patients with coinfection, and they showed a significantly higher mortality rate. In conclusion, bacterial and viral coinfection in CAP is not a rare occurrence in adults. Viral and bacterial coinfections have an adverse impact on the severity of the pneumonia, and increase morbidity and mortality in patients with CAP.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
