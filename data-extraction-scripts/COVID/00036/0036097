QSAR investigations indicated that the multi-target QSAR model was effective in describing the antimicrobial activity over the one-target QSAR models. Further the mt-QSAR model indicated the importance of the topological parameter, Balaban index (J) followed by the electronic parameter, LUMO and topological parameter, valence second order molecular connectivity index ((2)χ(v)) in describing the antimicrobial activity of synthesized compounds (1-20).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
