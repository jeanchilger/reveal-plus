The NRG and PSF were firstly dispersed in toluene under continuous stirring. Then, maleic anhydride (MA) was added into the mixture. Effects of blend ratio and of MA content (0.5–15%, w/w) on physical properties of the polymer composite were investigated. The toluene resistance of the polymer blend was improved after adding MA and cellulose. The highest toluene resistance was achieved when using 12% cellulose. The chemical reactions of MA with polymer blend and with composite were confirmed by ATR-FTIR. The hardness of the polymer blend and composite increased as a function of PSF. In addition, their impact strength increased with increasing NRG and cellulose contents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
