The infected reporter cells treated with the viral replication-suppressing compounds were examined via fluorescence microscope 7.5h postinfection. Twelve molecules showed moderate to potent antiviral activity at concentrations less than 32μM during the primary screening. Three compounds, anisomycin, linoleic acid, and lycorine, were chosen for validation. A dose-dependent cytotoxicity assay and a secondary screening using conventional plaque assay were conducted to confirm the results. The developed method can be used for rapid screening for molecules with antiviral activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
