Moreover, they are essential tools in all sectors of life sciences. Although the great majority of monoclonal antibodies currently in use are of mouse origin, the use of human B cells to generate monoclonal antibodies is increasing as new techniques to tap the human B cell repertoire are rapidly emerging. Cloned lines of immortalized human B cells are ideal sources of monoclonal antibodies. In this review, we summarize our studies to the regulation of the replicative life span, differentiation, and maturation of B cells that led to the development of a platform that uses immortalization of human B cells by in vitro genetic modification for antibody development. We describe a number of human antibodies that were isolated using this platform and the application of the technique in other species. We also discuss the use of immortalized B cells as antigen‐presenting cells for the discovery of tumor neoantigens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
