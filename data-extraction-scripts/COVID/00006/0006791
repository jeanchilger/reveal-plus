Furthermore, the compositions of plasma donor pools used for IG manufacturing are not standardized. While all immune globulin products meet the specifications set by the US FDA for antibodies to pathogens like measles and polio, they have variable levels of antibodies to other important viruses and infectious pathogens, particularly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). METHODS: An IVIG was developed that satisfies the requirements for treating patients with primary immune deficiency disease (PIDD) and also has standardized elevated levels of RSV neutralizing antibodies (RI-002). Plasma donors who have naturally occurring high circulating levels of neutralizing anti-RSV antibody were selected as the source for manufacturing IVIG to treat patients with PIDD to prevent serious bacterial infections. While the introduction of the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab has had a dramatic impact in diminishing the burden of RSV disease in the pediatric population, it does not meet the standards for replacing the deficient immune compartments of patients with PIDD. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients with PIDD at 9 different sites across the US were enrolled in this study and received regular infusions of RI-002 over the course of 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: There were zero serious bacterial infections, thus meeting the primary endpoint for this trial. The secondary endpoints including days missed from work due to infection, unscheduled visits to the physician, and days of hospitalization due to infection compared favorably to published reports of other IVIG products.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
