We analyzed the financial impact of ARI in 2012–2013. Costs associated with ARI during the respiratory viral season were ten times greater than during the non‐respiratory viral season, $31 224 and $3242 per 1000 patient‐days, respectively (P < 0·001). ARI are burdensome for pediatric long‐term care facilities not only because of the associated morbidity and mortality, but also due to the great financial costs of prevention.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
