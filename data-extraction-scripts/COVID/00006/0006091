<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-12-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Pre-Travel Medical Preparation of Business and Occupational Travelers: An Analysis of the Global TravEpiNet Consortium, 2009 to 2012</TITLE><BODY>The aim of the study was to understand more about pre-travel preparations and itineraries of business and occupational travelers. METHODS: De-identified data from 18 Global TravEpiNet clinics from January 2009 to December 2012 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 23,534 travelers, 61% were non-occupational and 39% occupational. Business travelers were more likely to be men, had short times to departure and shorter trip durations, and commonly refused influenza, meningococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines. Most business travelers indicated that employers suggested the pre-travel health consultation, whereas non-occupational travelers sought consultations because of travel health concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-groups of occupational travelers have characteristic profiles, with business travelers being particularly distinct. Employers play a role in encouraging business travelers to seek pre-travel consultations. Such consultations, even if scheduled immediately before travel, can identify vaccination gaps and increase coverage.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
