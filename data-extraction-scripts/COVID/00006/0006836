Ecological momentary reporting using text messages is a novel method for surveillance. This study compares respiratory viral activity detected through longitudinal community‐based surveillance using text message responses for sample acquisition and testing to respiratory viral activity obtained from hospital laboratory data from the same community. We demonstrate a significant correlation between community‐ and hospital laboratory‐based surveillance for most respiratory viruses, although the relative proportions of viruses detected in the community and hospital differed significantly.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
