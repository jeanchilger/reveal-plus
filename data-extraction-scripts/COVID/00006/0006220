Methods: In this study, we investigated whether C-class CpG ODN (CpG ODN-685) could facilitate tumor cell lysate to induce vigorous anti-tumor activity against tumors in mice both prophylactically and therapeutically. Results: It was found that the combination of tumor cell lysate and CpG ODN-685 could inhibit the growth of B16 melanoma and prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover CpG ODN-685 with the addition of tumor cell lysate can also cause the generation of tumor specific immune memory by inducing specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T lymphocytes in mice. Conclusion: The results suggest that CpG ODN-685 could be developed as an efficient adjuvant for tumor vaccines against melanoma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
