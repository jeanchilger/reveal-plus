<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-04-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Molecular Insights into Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus</TITLE><BODY>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne pathogen that causes high morbidity and mortality. Efficacy of vaccines and antivirals to treat human CCHFV infections remains limited and controversial. Research into pathology and underlying molecular mechanisms of CCHFV and other nairoviruses is limited. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of CCHFV replication and pathogenesis in the past decade. Here we review the most recent molecular advances in CCHFV-related research, and provide perspectives on future research.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
