Methods 47 982 household surveys were conducted in five European countries between 2001 and 2006. Results Overall influenza vaccination coverage increased over the years and reached 26·2% in 2005/06. Among the elderly ≥65 years, the rate increased significantly to 67·8% (2005/06). The most common reason for being vaccinated over the 5 years was the perception of influenza as a serious illness, which people want to avoid. The main reason for not getting vaccinated among those never previously vaccinated was feeling that they were unlikely to catch influenza. A recommendation by the family physician was the most encouraging factor for vaccination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
