(20XX) Journalists’ views about reporting avian influenza and a potential pandemic: a qualitative study. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(3), 224–229. Background The mass media is a key component of any public communication strategy for influenza or other respiratory illnesses, but coverage can be variable. In this study, we explored the factors that influenced journalists’ coverage of avian influenza as a model for coverage of a potential influenza pandemic. Methods This study involved semi‐structured interviews with 16 journalists from major Australian print, radio and television media organisations reporting on avian influenza and pandemic planning. Journalists, including reporters, editors and producers, were interviewed between October 2006 and August 2007. Thematic analysis was used to draw out major lessons for health communicators. Results Coverage of avian influenza was influenced by a small set of news values: catastrophic potential, cultural and geographical proximity, unfamiliarity and uncertainty. Lack of novelty and the absence of compelling images led to a decline in coverage. Journalists expressed concerns about the accuracy and impacts of reporting, but saw as critically important, their primary role as informants. They hence emphasised the importance of journalistic independence. Journalists all intended to continue working in a pandemic. Conclusions Health experts need to adapt their timetables and resources to journalists’ needs to improve their mutual communication. In crisis situations, journalists communicate with the public efficiently and effectively, but expert and journalistic views on the role and content of coverage may diverge in the post‐acute, reflective phase of a crisis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
