The capacity to rapidly assess SNPs that correlate with disease predisposition, drug efficacy and drug toxicity is a key step for the development of personalized medicine. In this work, a rapid one-step SNP detection method, real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), was first applied for CYP2C19 polymorphisms testing. The optimized method was established with specifically designed primers for target amplification by real-time detection in approximately 30 min under isothermal conditions. RT-LAMP amplified few copies of template to produce significant amounts of product and quantitatively detected human DNA with compatible specificity and sensitivity. The success in the establishment of this RT-LAMP protocol for CYP2C19 polymorphism testing is significant for the extension of this technique for the detection of other SNPs, which will further facilitate the development of personalized medicine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
