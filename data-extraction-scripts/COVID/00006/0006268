<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-10-12</DATELINE><TITLE>RNA Viruses: RNA Roles in Pathogenesis, Coreplication and Viral Load</TITLE><BODY>The review intends to present and recapitulate the current knowledge on the roles and importance of regulatory RNAs, such as microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, RNA binding proteins and enzymes processing RNAs or activated by RNAs, in cells infected by RNA viruses. The review focuses on how non-coding RNAs are involved in RNA virus replication, pathogenesis and host response, especially in retroviruses HIV, with examples of the mechanisms of action, transcriptional regulation, and promotion of increased stability of their targets or their degradation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
