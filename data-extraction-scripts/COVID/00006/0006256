Glycoproteins are one of the major components of human pathogenic viruses. They have been demonstrated to have important role(s) in infection and immunity. Concomitantly high titres of antibodies against these antigenic viral glycoproteins have paved the way for development of novel diagnostics. Availability of appropriate biomarkers is necessary for advance diagnosis of infectious diseases especially in case of outbreaks. As human mobilization has increased manifold nowadays, dissemination of infectious agents became quicker that paves the need of rapid diagnostic system. In case of viral infection it is an emergency as virus spreads and mutates very fast. This review encircles the vast arena of viral glycoproteins, their importance in health and disease and their diagnostic applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
