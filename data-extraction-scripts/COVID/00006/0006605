Most pleiotropic cytokines are secreted and bind to specific receptors, activating the signaling pathways including JAK-STAT for the proliferation, differentiation and functional capacity of immune cells. This review focuses on several critical adaptors in innate immune signaling cascades and recent progress in their molecular mechanisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
