The objective of this study was to investigate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the interleukin (IL)-1β –31 T/C, IL-6 –174 G/C, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) –308 G/A, and interferon γ (IFN-γ) +874 A/T genes for their possible association with susceptibility to early onset sepsis (EOS) in Saudi newborn infants. A total of 205 newborn infants aged 1-2 days were consecutively enrolled onto the study having met the inclusion criteria (as per the research protocol). DNA was extracted from filter papers using the Chelex-100 method. The cytokines SNP were genotyping using Taqman 5’ nuclease allelic discrimination. For cytokine measurements we used the commercially available Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit. Our results show that the circulating IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated in EOS patients compared to suspected and sepsis-free control groups; and IL-1β –31C, IL-6 –174G, TNF-α –308G, and IFN-γ +874A alleles were associated with EOS in Saudi infants. In conclusion, analysis of cytokines concentrations and SNP for the four tested genes can be used as a predictor of sepsis outcome in newborns.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
