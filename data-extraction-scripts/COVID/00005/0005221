METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study conducted at the Prince Mohammed International Airport in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia between August and September 2014. Data were collected by semi-structured questionnaires during personal interviews. Non-random purposive sampling was conducted to target workers at higher risk of acquiring infection from travellers. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-six participants were recruited of whom 92.5% were males. The study participants were workers in 8 different sectors. Twenty-six percent of the participants were health workers. Non-health workers were more likely to be concerned on acquiring infection while working at the airport compared with health workers (p=0.023). The most commonly feared disease was Ebola viral disease (EBV) among 30% of health workers, and 47% of non-health workers. Approximately 47% of non-health workers reported no knowledge of the procedures implemented during public health emergencies. The proportion of participants who received public health related training among non-health workers was significantly lower compared with health workers (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION: More emphasis should be given to educating airport workers on the potential health threats at the airport. Specific guidelines for public health emergencies at the airport should be established and communicated with airport sectors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
