Although several mechanisms preventing viral infection of particular hosts have been described, the mechanisms and constraints on viral host expansion are ill defined. We describe here mycobacteriophage Patience, a newly isolated phage recovered using Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155 as a host. Patience has genomic features distinct from its M. smegmatis host, including a much lower GC content (50.3% versus 67.4%) and an abundance of codons that are rarely used in M. smegmatis. Nonetheless, it propagates well in M. smegmatis, and we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to show expression of over 75% of the predicted proteins, to identify new genes, to refine the genome annotation, and to estimate protein abundance. We propose that Patience evolved primarily among lower-GC hosts and that the disparities between its genomic profile and that of M. smegmatis presented only a minimal barrier to host expansion. Rapid adaptions to its new host include recent acquisition of higher-GC genes, expression of out-of-frame proteins within predicted genes, and codon selection among highly expressed genes toward the translational apparatus of its new host.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
