Objective To determine the role of HCoV‐NL63 in infants and young children hospitalised with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in Cape Town, South Africa. Methods Respiratory specimens were collected from 1055 infants and young children hospitalised with ARI in 2003–2004. Samples were screened by RT‐PCR to detect HCoV‐NL63 and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Standard shell vial culture and immunofluoresence was used to detect the common respiratory viruses including RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, adenovirus and CMV. Results A respiratory virus was found in 401/1055 (38·0%) samples. HCoV‐NL63 was detected in 9/1055 (0·85%) with peak activity during autumn (67%). Most patients had a diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection (6/9; 67%). Conclusions This is the first report of HCoV‐NL63 infections in hospitalised children in Africa. During the 2‐year period HCoV‐NL63 played a minor role in ARI in children.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
