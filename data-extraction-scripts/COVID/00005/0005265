Previous studies suggested a close association between the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) genetic variant rs12252 and influenza. Here, we explored the correlation between the rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity using meta-analysis. METHODS: Relevant studies published before May 22, 2014 were retrieved from PubMed, ISI web of knowledge, EBSCO, and Cochrane central register of controlled trials databases. Association between rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity were determined using statistical analysis of odds ratios (ORs). RESULTS: A total of four studies consisting of 445 cases and 4180 controls were included in our analysis. Generally, there is increased risk of influenza in subjects carrying rs12252 in the recessive model (CC vs. CT+TT: OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.49-3.70, P<0.001), the dominant model (CC+CT vs. TT: OR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.18–2.22, P=0.003), the homozygote comparison (CC vs. TT: OR=4.11, 95% CI: 2.15–7.84, P<0.001), and the allele contrast (C vs. T: OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.32–2.13, P<0.001). Stratification analysis of ethnicity and severity revealed a significant increase in influenza susceptibility by IFITM3-SNP rs12252 among both Asian and Caucasian population. SNP rs12252 shows significant impact on severe infections (P<0.05), but not on mild influenza. Besides, our result also associated rs12252 with influenza severity (severe vs. mild: OR=2.37, 95% CI: 1.32–4.25, P=0.004), (severe vs. control: OR=2.70, 95% CI: 1.85–3.94, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests a significant association between a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) with severe influenza susceptibility, but not in mild influenza subjects, in both UK Caucasians and Han Chinese population. The rs12252-C allele causes a 23.7% higher chance of infection and also constitutes a risk factor for more severe influenza.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
