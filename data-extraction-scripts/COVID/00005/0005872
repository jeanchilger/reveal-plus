We conducted a comprehensive 9‐year study on HCoVs by analyzing 1137 respiratory samples from four subsets of patients (asymptomatic, general community, with comorbidities, and hospitalized) in São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: A pan‐coronavirus RT‐PCR screening assay was performed, followed by species‐specific real‐time RT‐PCR monoplex assays. RESULTS: Human coronaviruses were detected in 88 of 1137 (7.7%) of the samples. The most frequently detected HCoV species were NL63 (50.0%) and OC43 (27.3%). Patients with comorbidities presented the highest risk of acquiring coronavirus infection (odds ratio = 4.17; 95% confidence interval = 1.9–9.3), and children with heart diseases revealed a significant HCoV infection presence. Dyspnea was more associated with HCoV‐229E infections (66.6%), and cyanosis was reported only in HCoV‐OC43 infections. There were interseasonal differences in the detection frequencies, with HCoV‐229E being predominant in the year 2004 (61.5%) and HCoV‐NL63 (70.8%) in 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a novel insight into the epidemiology and clinical knowledge of HCoVs among different subsets of patients, revealing that these viruses may cause more than mild respiratory tract disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
