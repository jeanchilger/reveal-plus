The influences of the ethanol concentration, extraction time, temperature, and the liquid–solid ratio on flavonoid yield were investigated. Based on ANOVA results, a second-order quadratic polynomial model could be applied to characterize the extraction process. The following optimal extraction conditions were identified: ethanol concentration, 52.98 %; extraction time, 2.12 h; extraction temperature, 62.46 °C; and liquid–solid ratio, 35.23. The predicted extraction yield was 19.437 mg/g when these optimal conditions were used. The proposed method was successfully employed to extract flavonoids from S. baicalensis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
