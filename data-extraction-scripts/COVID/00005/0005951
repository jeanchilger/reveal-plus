We investigated the effects of experimental human HRV serotype 16 infection on the upper respiratory tract microbiota. METHODS: Six healthy volunteers were infected with HRV16. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA-targeted pyrosequencing on throat swabs taken prior, during and after infection. We compared overall community diversity, phylogenetic structure of the ecosystem and relative abundances of the different bacteria between time points. RESULTS: During acute infection strong trends towards increases in the relative abundances of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Neisseria subflava were observed, as well as a weaker trend towards increases of Staphylococcus aureus. No major differences were observed between day-1 and day 60, whereas differences between subjects were very high. CONCLUSIONS: HRV16 infection is associated with the increase of three genera known to be associated with secondary infections following HRV infections. The observed changes of upper respiratory tract microbiota could help explain why HRV infection predisposes to bacterial otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia.
