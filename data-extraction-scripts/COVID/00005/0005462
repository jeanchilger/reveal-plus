All compounds containing P–C–C–triazole or P–C–C–CH(2)–triazole moieties exist in single conformations in which the diethoxyphosphoryl and substituted 1,2,3-triazolyl or substituted (1,2,3-triazolyl)methyl groups are oriented anti. All phosphonates were evaluated in vitro for activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds were endowed with antiviral activity. They were not cytostatic at 100 μM.
