In this study, the crystallization and crystallographic analysis of MERS-CoV NP-NTD (amino acids 39–165), with a molecular weight of 14.7 kDa, are reported. MERS-CoV NP-NTD was crystallized at 293 K using PEG 3350 as a precipitant and a 94.5% complete native data set was collected from a cooled crystal at 77 K to 2.63 Å resolution with an overall R (merge) of 9.6%. The crystals were monoclinic and belonged to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 35.60, b = 109.64, c = 91.99 Å, β = 101.22°. The asymmetric unit contained four MERS-CoV NP-NTD molecules.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
