In this work, the origin of the long-term storage stability and sustained NO release mechanism of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d-penicillamine (SNAP)-doped CarboSil 20 80A polymer, a biomedical thermoplastic silicone-polycarbonate-urethane, is explored. Long-term (22 days) localized NO release is achieved by utilizing a cross-linked silicone rubber as topcoats, which can greatly reduce the amount of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide leaching from the SNAP-doped CarboSil films, as measured by LC–MS. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction characterization of SNAP-doped CarboSil films demonstrate that a polymer–crystal composite is formed during the solvent evaporation process when SNAP exceeds its solubility in CarboSil (ca. 3.4–4.0 wt %). Further, when exceeding this solubility threshold, SNAP exists in an orthorhombic crystal form within the bulk of the polymer. The proposed mechanism of sustained NO release in SNAP-doped CarboSil is that the solubilized SNAP in the polymer matrix decomposes and releases NO, primarily in the water-rich regions near the polymer/solution interface, and the dissolved SNAP in the bulk polymeric phase becomes unsaturated, resulting in the dissolution of crystalline SNAP within the bulk of the polymer. This is a very slow process that ultimately leads to NO release at the physiological flux levels for >3 weeks. The increased stability of SNAP within CarboSil is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the SNAP molecules that crystallize. This crystallization also plays a key role in maintaining RSNO stability within the CarboSil polymer for >8 months at 37 °C (88.5% remains). Further, intravascular catheters fabricated with this new material are demonstrated to significantly decrease the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections) (in vitro) over a 7 day period, with 5 log units reduction of viable cell count on catheter surfaces. It is also shown that the NO release catheters can greatly reduce thrombus formation on the catheter surfaces during 7 h implantation in rabbit veins, when compared to the control catheters fabricated without SNAP. These results suggest that the SNAP-doped CarboSil system is a very attractive new composite material for creating long-term NO release medical devices with increased stability and biocompatibility.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
