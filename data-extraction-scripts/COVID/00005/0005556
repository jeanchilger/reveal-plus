This process of immune homeostasis, as maintained by dendritic cells, is susceptible to dysregulation by certain pathogens during chronic infections. Such dysregulation may lead to disease perpetuation with potentially severe systemic consequences. Here we discuss in detail how intracellular pathogens exploit dendritic cells and evade degradation by altering or evading autophagy. This novel mechanism explains in part the chronic, persistent nature observed in several immuno-inflammatory diseases, including periodontal disease. Also, here we propose a hypothetical model on the plausible role of autophagy in the context of periodontal disease. Promotion of autophagy may open new therapeutic strategies in the search for a “cure” for periodontal disease in humans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
