Stem Cell transplantation is used for the treatment for a wide variety of diseases, including leukemia and lymphoma. PURPOSE: This study highlights prevention strategies of infectious diseases among HSCT donors and recipients in our institute as guided by International guidelines. We aim to highlight the strategy for extensive screening of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis cases in all the stem cell units stored in our facility METHODS: We searched the institutional database to identify cases of infectious diseases among HSC transplants. Extensive donor evaluation was conducted through screening and laboratory infectious disease testing for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, CMV infection and syphilis. RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2014, 263 consecutive adult HSCT were performed. An approximate equal number of autologous and allogeneic HSC collections were undertaken. The median age for autologous donors was 35 years, whereas that of allogeneic donors is 25 years. Of the 263 stem cell donors, we found 18 patients (autologous) and 2 donors (allogeneic) to be infected. We did not find any of the donors infected with HIV by the serology as well as the NAT testing protocol CONCLUSION: Donor screening and testing is the most critical parameter in stem cell transplantation in order to ensure the safety of the product to be transplanted. Modifications in the regulations related to donor screening are aimed at providing safe transplantation and negate the risk of accidental infection of the donor.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
