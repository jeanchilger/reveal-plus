The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 0.59- and 2.1-mg FA intravitreal implant in patients with noninfectious posterior uveitis. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, dose-controlled study was performed. Patients were randomized to the 0.59- or 2.1-mg FA implant surgically placed in the vitreous cavity through a pars plana incision and were evaluated at visits through 3 years. Patients with bilateral disease had the more severely affected eye implanted. Outcomes included uveitis recurrence rate, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), use of adjunctive therapy, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients, predominantly Asian, were implanted (n = 117, 0.59-mg implant; n = 122, 2.1-mg implant). Approximately 80% of patients had bilateral disease. Recurrence rates for implanted eyes decreased from 42.3% during the 1-year pre-implantation period to 25.9% during the 3-year post-implantation period (P = 0.0003) and increased for nonimplanted fellow eyes from 19.8 to 59.7% (P < 0.0001). More implanted eyes gained ≥3 lines of BCVA compared to nonimplanted fellow eyes (P ≤ 0.0046); and implanted eyes required less adjunctive systemic therapy and fewer periocular injections (P < 0.0001). Elevations of intraocular pressure (≥10 mm Hg) were frequent in implanted eyes (67.8%, 0.59-mg implant; 71.3%, 2.1-mg implant); nearly all (94.9%) phakic implanted eyes required cataract surgery. CONCLUSION: The FA intravitreal implant significantly reduced uveitis recurrence rates and led to improvements in visual acuity and reductions in adjunctive therapy. Lens clarity and intraocular pressure require monitoring.
