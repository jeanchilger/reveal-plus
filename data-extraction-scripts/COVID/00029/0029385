A finer-grained knowledge of the parameters and dynamics of the viruses commonly underlying ILI is needed for modeling, diagnostic, and intervention efforts. We conducted an extensive literature review for epidemiological parameter values for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human coronavirus (HCoV), and adenovirus. We also developed a deterministic SEIR model for ILI, and derived an expression for R0. We here report ranges and means for parameters for these five common viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
