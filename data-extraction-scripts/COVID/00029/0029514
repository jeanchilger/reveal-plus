Rhesus Macaques immunized with the recombinant adenovirus generated antigen-specific humoral and cellular response. Furthermore, the vaccine provided significant protection against subsequent live SARS-CoV challenge. In contrast, three out of four monkeys immunized with placebo suffered severe alveolar damage and pulmonary destruction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
