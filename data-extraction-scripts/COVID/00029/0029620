<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Open-source analytics tools for studying the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak</TITLE><BODY>To provide convenient access to epidemiological data on the coronavirus outbreak, we developed an R package, nCov2019 (https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019). Besides detailed real-time statistics, it offers access to three data sources with detailed daily statistics from December 1, 2019, for 43 countries and more than 500 Chinese cities. We also developed a web app (http://www.bcloud.org/e/) with interactive plots and simple time-series forecasts. These analytics tools could be useful in informing the public and studying how this and similar viruses spread in populous countries.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
