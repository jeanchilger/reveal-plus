Methods The methanolic flower extracts were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral and cytotoxic activities using viruses like herpes simplex-1 and 2, vaccinia, vesicular stomatitis, cox sackie, respiratory syncytical, feline corona, feline herpes, para influenza, reo-1, sindbis and punta toro viruses in different cell lines, like Hel, HeLa, Crandell Reus feline kidney and Vero cell cultures. Results Among the viruses used the extract possessed strongest antiviral activity against herpes simplex 1 and 2, repiratory syncytical, para influenza, reo, sindbis, cox sackie and punta toro viruses that was (EC50=20 μg/mL and 45 μg/mL) and moderate activity for remaining viruses (EC50= 100 μg/mL). The antiviral activities assessed by calculating the selectivity index may be due to the presence of flavonoids in the extracts there by inhibit the virus cell fusion in the early and replication stages. The cytotoxicity effect was evaluated using MTT assay and the results revealed that the extracts exhibited cytotoxicity from the range of 20 to 100 μg/mL. Conclusions Present results confirmed that the S. grandiflora used as a good antimicrobial agent in future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
