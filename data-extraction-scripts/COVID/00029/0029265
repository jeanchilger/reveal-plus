Results were compared against conventional microbiologic assays.MEASUREMENTS & MAIN RESULTSmNGS demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detecting respiratory microbes (human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, human herpesvirus 6 and cytomegalovirus) when compared to standard testing. Previously unrecognized LRTI pathogens were identified in six patients for whom standard testing was negative (human coronavirus 229E, human rhinovirus A, Corynebacterium propinquum and Streptococcus mitis); findings were confirmed by independent PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing. Relative to patients without infection, patients with infection had increased expression of immunity related genes (p=0.022) and significantly lower diversity of their respiratory microbiome (p=0.017).CONCLUSIONSCompared to conventional diagnostics, mNGS enhanced detection of pathogens in BAL fluid from HCT patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that combining unbiased microbial pathogen detection with assessment of host gene biomarkers of immune response may hold promise for enhancing the diagnosis of post-HCT respiratory infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
