<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Duration of viral detection in throat and rectum of a patient with COVID-19</TITLE><BODY>The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises concern about a global pandemic. Knowledge about the duration of viral shedding remains important for patient management and infection control. We report the duration of viral detection in throat and rectum of a COVID-19 patient treated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively. Because live SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully isolated from a stool sample from a COVID-19 patient in China, the results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients may remain infectious for long periods, and fecal-oral transmission may be possible. Therefore, our finding has important implications for infection control.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
