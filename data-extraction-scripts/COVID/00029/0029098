The efficacy of the tonic was evaluated and expressed as cell proliferation rate and plaque reduction rate in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, against 3 strains of influenza A and B viruses. This boiling water (at 100°C) extract of Isatidis Radix (RIE) showed antiviral activity against influenza virus A and B. The concentration for 50% inhibition of influenza virus A replication (IC50) in MDCK cell was 12.6mg/mL with a therapeutic index >8. When cells were incubated with RIE prior to virus adsorption, the numbers of viable cell were at least doubled compared to the numbers of virus control, RIE incubation after virus adsorption and RIE incubation with virus prior to adsorption, in both influenza virus A and B. Moreover, much less virus particles were spotted by scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the RIE pre-treated cells than the cells without RIE treatment. These results indicate the antiviral activity of RIE is mainly attributed to its host cell protection effect but not actions on virus or post-virus-adsorption interruption. Cell, but not virus, is more likely to be the action target of RIE.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
