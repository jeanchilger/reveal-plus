There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. In this project, a novel multi-epitope vaccine for COVID-19 virus based on surface glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. At the first, seventeen potent linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The ability of the selected epitopes to induce interferon-gamma was evaluate using IFNepitope web server. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Three-dimensional structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular docking studies with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules. The results proposed that the multi-epitope vaccine with 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 was a stable construct with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
