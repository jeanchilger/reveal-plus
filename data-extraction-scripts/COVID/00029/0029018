<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography Guidance for Use of Cardiac Computed Tomography Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The world is currently suffering through a pandemic outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently advises medical facilities to “reschedule non-urgent outpatient visits as necessary” (1). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the United Kingdom National Health Service and several other international agencies covering Asia, North America and most regions of the world have recommended similar “social distancing” measures(2, 3). The Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) offers guidance for cardiac CT (CCT) practitioners to help implement these international recommendations in order to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission in their facilities while deciding on the timing of outpatient and inpatient CCT exams. This document also emphasizes SCCT’s commitment to the health and well-being of CCT technologists, imagers, trainees, and research community, as well as the patients served by CCT.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
