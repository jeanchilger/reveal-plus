As a result of such research, 100% MCP was defined as minimum 31,500 and maximum 351,900, and 95% KR was defined as minimum 9,400 and maximum 502,800, 75% KR was defined as minimum 3,600 and maximum 126,900, and 50% MCP was defined as minimum 1,800 and maximum 51,700. The home range of feral cats was also analyzed during daytime and nighttime, and all five individuals showed a wider home range during the nighttime than daytime. The analysis of gender shows that the average home range of female feral cats is larger than the average of males. Meanwhile, the results of information data with wide-open areas such as farm land and terrace land on the river showed that the analyzed value was increased generally, and showed variable values depending on the gender and size of each individual feral cat.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
