Here we report that delivery of CasRx by adeno-associated virus via intravitreal injection could efficiently knockdown Vegfa transcripts and significantly reduce the area of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization in a mouse model of age-related macular degeneration. Thus, RNA-targeting CRISPR system could be used for in vivo gene therapy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
