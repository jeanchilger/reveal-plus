Whereas apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, bleb formation and retained membrane integrity, necroptosis and pyroptosis exhibit osmotic imbalance driven cytoplasmic swelling and early membrane damage. These three cell death forms exert distinct immune stimulatory potential. The caspase driven apoptotic cell demise is considered in many circumstances as anti-inflammatory, whereas the two lytic cell death modalities can efficiently trigger immune response by releasing damage associated molecular patterns to the extracellular space. The relevance of these cell death modalities in infections can be best demonstrated by the presence of viral proteins that directly interfere with cell death pathways. Conversely, some pathogens hijack the cell death signaling routes to initiate a targeted attack against the immune cells of the host, and extracellular bacteria can benefit from the destruction of intact extracellular barriers upon cell death induction. The complexity and the crosstalk between these cell death modalities reflect a continuous evolutionary race between pathogens and host. This chapter discusses the current advances in the research of cell death signaling with regard to viral and bacterial infections and describes the network of the cell death initiating molecular mechanisms that selectively recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
