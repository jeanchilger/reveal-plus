<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Estimating the Case Fatality Risk of COVID-19 using Cases from Outside China</TITLE><BODY>There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China. Therefore, we considered symptomatic cases outside of China (countries/settings with 20+ cases) and the proportion who are in intensive care units (4.0%, 14/349 on 13 February 2020). Given what is known about CFRs for ICU patients with severe respiratory conditions from a meta-analysis, we estimated a CFR of 1.37% (95%CI: 0.57% to 3.22%) for COVID-19 cases outside of China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
