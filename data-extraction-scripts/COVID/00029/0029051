Experience has shown that professionals with specific training in Intensive Care Medicine are needed to provide high quality care to critically ill patients. In Europe, important steps have been taken towards the standardization of training programs of the different member states. However, it is now necessary to take one more step forward, that is, the creation of a primary specialty in Intensive Care Medicine. Care of the critically ill needs to be led by specialists who have received specific and complete training and who have the necessary professional competences to provide maximum quality care to their patients. The future of the specialty presents challenges that must be faced with determination, with the main objective of meeting the needs of the population.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
