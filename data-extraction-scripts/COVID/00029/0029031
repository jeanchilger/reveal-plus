SARS-CoV-2 is closest to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in structure. The high prevalence of COVID-19 is a result of a lack of symptoms at onset. Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment and prevention. Whole genome sequences and some viral proteins were investigated to determine gaps and changes in alternation of nucleotides and amino acid sequences. We evaluate 11 complete genome sequences of different coronaviruses using BAST and MAFFT software. We also selected seven types of structural proteins. We conclude that COVID-19 might produce new mutations, specifically in glycoproteins, so caution and complete preparation by health authorities is required.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
