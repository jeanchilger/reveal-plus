Methods The present study is an attempt to elucidate inhibition potential of andrographolide and its derivatives along with an associated binding mechanism through virtual screening and molecular docking simulation studies. Results Our findings revealed structural conformation changes in 150 loop, secondary sialic acid binding site residues of ACZ97474 {Neuraminidase (A/Blore/NIV236/2009(H1N1)}. Andrographolide have been identified as the highest binging energy of −10.88 Kcal/mol, 3 hydrogen bond interactions (Arg152, Lys150, and Gly197), total intermolecular energy of −12.07 Kcal/mol with bioactivity value (Ki) of 10.59 nmol/L, while the Food and Drug Admistraton approved drug Oseltamivir and Zanamivir have shown 2 and 4 hydrogen bond interactions with binding energies of −6.28 Kcal/mol and −7.73Kcal/mol, respectively, which is higher than andrographolide. The guanidine group of Arg152 has binding affinities to the hydrophilic nature of the inhibitors (-OH and =O groups), as identified by docking of andrographolide (CID: 5318517) on neuraminidase. Conclusions Hence, andrographolide has the potential to inhibit neuraminidase activity of H1N1 and may be used as an alternative medicinal therapy for swine flu positive patient. With potent antiviral activity and a potentially new mechanism of action, andrographolide may warrant further evaluation as a possible therapy for influenza.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
