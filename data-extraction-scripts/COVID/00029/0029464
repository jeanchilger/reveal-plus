<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Understanding the present status and forecasting of COVID―19 in Wuhan</TITLE><BODY>The present status of COVID―19 is analyzed and the end of the disease is forecasted. The peak of the epidemic is different in three regions, Wuhan, Hubei province except Wuhan, and mainland China except Hubei. In two regions except Wuhan, the peak of the epidemic passed ten days ago. If the trend until February 11 does not change, the disease may end by the end of February. In Wuhan, the epidemic reached a peak but the reported number of newly infected patients fluctuates largely. We need to know the reason for the big fluctuation to forecast the end of the disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
