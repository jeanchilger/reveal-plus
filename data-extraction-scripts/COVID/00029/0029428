<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in China</TITLE><BODY>Our manuscript was based on surveillance cases of COVID-19 identified before January 26, 2020. As of February 20, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China has reached 18 times of the number in our manuscript. While the methods and the main conclusions in our original analyses remain solid, we decided to withdraw this preprint for the time being, and will replace it with a more up-to-date version shortly.
