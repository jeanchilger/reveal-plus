This transcription factor has been shown to interfere with myogenesis when misexpressed at very low levels in myoblasts, and to cause cell death when overexpressed at high levels. A previous report using adeno-associated virus to deliver high levels of DUX4 to mouse skeletal muscle demonstrated severe pathology that was suppressed on a p53 knockout background, implying that DUX4 acted through the p53 pathway. Here, we investigate the p53-dependence of DUX4 using both in vitro cellular and the transgenic iDUX4[2.7] mouse models. We find that inhibiting p53 has no effect on the cytoxicity of DUX4 in vitro. When crossed onto the p53 null background, we find no suppression of the male-specific lethality or skin phenotypes of the DUX4 transgene, and find that primary myoblasts from this mouse are still killed by DUX4 expression. These data challenge the notion that the p53 pathway is central to the pathogenicity of DUX4.Summary StatementDUX4 is thought to mediate cytopathology through p53. Here, DUX4 is shown to kill primary myoblasts and promote pathological phenotypes in the iDUX4[2.7] mouse model on the p53-null background, calling into question this notion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
