<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Clinical outcomes of 402 patients with COVID-2019 from a single center in Wuhan, China</TITLE><BODY>The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is causing widespread infections and significant mortality. Previous studies describing clinical characteristics of the disease contained small cohorts from individual centers or larger series consisting of mixed cases from different hospitals. We report analyses of mortality and disease severity among 402 patients from a single hospital. The cohort included 297 patients with confirmed and 105 with suspected diagnosis. The latter group met the criteria for clinical diagnosis but nucleic acid tests results were initially interpreted as suspicious. Data were compared between genders and among different age groups. The overall case fatality is 5.2%. However, patients 70 years of age or older suffered a significantly higher mortality (17.8%), associated with more patients having severe or critical illness (57.5%). Patients 50 years of age or older had a mortality of 8.0%, and those younger than 50 years, 1.2%. Male patients had a mortality of 7.6% versus 2.9% in females.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
