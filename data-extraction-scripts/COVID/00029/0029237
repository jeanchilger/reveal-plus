However, the mechanisms of virus dissemination are presently unclear. We show that peripheral blood-derived monocytes/macrophages from chickens (chPBMC) are productively infected by clinical strains of IBV, accompanied by induction of apoptosis. Our data suggest that chPBMCs play a role in the dissemination of IBV, and may be important for viral pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
