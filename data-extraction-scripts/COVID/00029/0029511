Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is reversible and Pcsk9 could be repeatedly down-regulated, providing an effective strategy to reversibly modulate metabolic genes. The present work supplies a successful proof-of-concept trial that suggests efficient and regulatory knockdown of target metabolic genes for a designed metabolism modulation in the liver.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
