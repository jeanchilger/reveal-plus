This study demonstrated that the sero-type 3 reovirus strain Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04) could transiently activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in A549 cells at earlier time points of infection. The blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased viral RNA synthesis and yield. The role of the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt in regulating reovirus replication was further analyzed. We found that during reovirus infection, the level of phosphorylated MDM2 (p-MDM2) was increased and the expression of p53 was reduced. In addition, the blockage of PI3K/Akt by Ly294002 or knockdown of Akt by siRNA reduced the level of p-MDM2 and increased the level of p53. Both indicated that the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt were activated. Pre-treatment with Nutlin, which can destroy MDM2 and p53 cross-talk and increase the expression of p53 RNA and protein, dose-dependently enhanced reovirus replication. Additionally, the overexpression of p53 alone also supported reovirus replication, and knockdown of p53 significantly inhibited viral replication. This study demonstrates that PI3K/Akt/p53 activated by mammalian reovirus can serve as a pathway for inhibiting virus replication/infection, yet the precise mechanism of this process remains under further investigation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
