<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-09-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Anti-infective Agents</TITLE><BODY>Infections may be hazardous to the health of the mother, the course of pregnancy, and the unborn child. They can lead to premature labor or premature rupture of membranes and thereby increase the risk for spontaneous abortion and prematurity. Furthermore, certain germs can pass to the unborn child and harm it directly. Therefore, an anti-infective treatment which should be both effective and safe for the mother and the unborn child is often required. The use of penicillines and older cephalosporines is well documented and considered to be safe. Consequently, they are the drug of choice during pregnancy. In selected cases of bacterial resistance or intolerance to first-line antibiotics, other anti-infective agents might be recommended. Especially for life-threatening infections, a therapy with not so well-tried agents might be needed. The potential benefit of treatment in such cases most often outbalances the potential risk for the unborn child.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
