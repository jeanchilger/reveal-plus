In addition, through these models we have gathered considerable insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these infections and the inflammatory and immune responses they elicit in the host. This article reviews new promising models introduced recently in this field. Section Editor: Alastair Stewart – University of Melbourne, Australia There has long been interest in the potential relationships between viral respiratory illness and chronic respiratory disease. However, until relatively recently there have been few attempts to develop animal models that address chronic influences of acute and chronic infections. Professor Piedimonte and colleagues provide a commentary on the impact of molecular biology on studies of viral infection and address the important issues that arise in selecting appropriate strains and species to model the course of infection, inflammation and long term sequelae.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
