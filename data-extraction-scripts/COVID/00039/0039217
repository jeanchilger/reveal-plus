However, prognostic role of coinfection remains unclear. Objective Evaluate relation between respiratory viral confection and illness severity in children. Study design MEDLINE (through PUBMED), EMBASE, EBSCO, LILACS databases were searched up to March 2015 by two independent reviewers. Studies assessing severity of viral coinfection in patients aged less than 18 years were included. Standardized forms were used for data extraction of population, study design, clinical syndromes, virus combinations compared and severity outcomes. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed through EPHPP and GRADE. Subgroup analysis was performed according to age and viral combinations. Results Of 5218 records screened, 43 were included in analysis. Viral coinfection did not influence risks of all outcomes assessed: length of stay (mean difference in days in coinfection, −0.10 [95% confidence interval: −0.51 to 0.31]), length of supplemental oxygen (−0.42 [−1.05 to 0.20]), need of hospitalization (odds ratio of coinfection, 0.96 [95% confidence interval: 0.61–1.51]), supplemental oxygen (0.94 [0.66 to 1.34]), need of intensive care (0.99 [0.64 to 1.54]), mechanical ventilation (0.81 [0.33 to 2.01]) and death (2.22 [0.83 to 5.95]). Sub-analyses according to age and viral combinations have not shown influence of these factors in outcomes. Conclusions Respiratory viral coinfection did not increase severity in all outcomes assessed. Further studies are necessary to confirm this finding, especially regarding role of specific viral interactions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
