We have created a surface which is auto-protective to human innate immunity by combining three fundamentally different strategies, all developed by us previously, which have been shown to induce substantial, but incomplete hemocompatibility when used separately. In summary, we have conjugated a factor H –binding peptide; and an ADP-degrading enzyme; using a PEG linker on both material and cellular surfaces. When exposed to human whole blood, factor H was specifically recruited to the modified surfaces and inhibited complement attack. In addition, activation of platelets and coagulation was efficiently attenuated, by degrading ADP. Thus, by inhibiting thromboinflammation using a multicomponent approach, we have created a hybrid surface with the potential to greatly reduce incompatibility reactions involving biomaterials and transplantation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
