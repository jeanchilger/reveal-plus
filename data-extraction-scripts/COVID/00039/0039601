Two of these variants, sp-4 and JHM-X, were found to have smaller mRNA3 and E2 glycoprotein species compared with those of the other four variants. In addition, sp-4 and JHM-X were distinguished from the other four variants by their inability to bind to monoclonal antibodies recognizing two antigenic domains of the E2 molecule. Thus, six JHMV variants could clearly be divided into two groups with respect to the size and antigenicity of their E2 glycoproteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
