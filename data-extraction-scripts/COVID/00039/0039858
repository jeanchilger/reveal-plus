This paper presents the crystal structure of wild-type and E58A mutant human Ap4A hydrolase. Similar to the canonical Nudix fold, human Ap4A hydrolase shows the common αβα-sandwich architecture. Interestingly, two sulfate ions and one diphosphate coordinated with some conserved residues were observed in the active cleft, which affords a better understanding of a possible mode of substrate binding.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
