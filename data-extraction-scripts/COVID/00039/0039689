TBK1 mediates the activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, leading to the induction of type I IFNs (IFN-α/β) following viral infections. TBK1 must be tightly regulated to effectively control viral infections and maintain immune homeostasis. TBK1 activity can be regulated in a variety of ways, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, kinase activity modulation and prevention of functional TBK1-containing complexes formation. Furthermore, multiple viruses have evolved elaborate strategies to circumvent IFN responses by targeting TBK1. Here we provide an overview of TBK1 in antiviral immunity and recent developments on the regulation of TBK1 activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
