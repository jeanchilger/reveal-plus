Here we characterized the impact of VEEV on signaling pathways regulating cell death in human primary astrocytes. VEEV productively infected primary astrocytes and caused an upregulation of early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene expression at 9 and 18 h post infection. EGR1 induction was dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), but not on p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Knockdown of EGR1 significantly reduced VEEV-induced apoptosis and impacted viral replication. Knockdown of ERK1/2 or PERK significantly reduced EGR1 gene expression, dramatically reduced viral replication, and increased cell survival as well as rescued cells from VEEV-induced apoptosis. These data indicate that EGR1 activation and subsequent cell death are regulated through ERK and PERK pathways in VEEV infected primary astrocytes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
