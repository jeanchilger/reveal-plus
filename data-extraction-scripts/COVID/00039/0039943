SSPE patients as well as SAME rats revealed oligoclonal, intrathecal antibody synthesis with MV specificity. SAME rats synthesized MV-specific antibodies intracerebrally to a higher extent than SSPE patients. Although a restricted isoelectric pattern of MV-specific antibodies was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SSPE patients as well as of SAME rats, the heterogeneity within clusters of immunoglobulin bands was higher in the rat specimens. Increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability for albumin was exclusively detected in SAME rats but not in SSPE patients. These data suggest that the rat model offers excellent opportunities to study the initial humoral events in MV-induced encephalitides.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
