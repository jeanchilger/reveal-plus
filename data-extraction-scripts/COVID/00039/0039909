The results indicate that CCL3 participates in an effective host response to MHV infection by contributing to CD11c(+)CD11b(+)CD8α(−) DC maturation, activation, and migration to cervical lymph nodes (CLN). Diminished CD8α(−) DC activation correlated with reduced IFN-γ expression by virus-specific T cells accompanied by increased IL-10 production suggesting that CCL3 contributes to an effective host response to viral infection by enhancing the T cell activation potential of DC.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
