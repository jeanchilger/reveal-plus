Although DENV infection induces lifelong immunity against viruses of the same serotypes, the subsequent infection with the heterologous serotypes can cause more severe form of the disease, such as Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). However, there is neither approved vaccine nor specific drugs available to treat this disease. In this study, previously developed 19 human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) showing strong to moderate cross neutralizing activity were selected. Most of them (13/19) were targeted to domain II of envelop glycoprotein. To understand and clarify the recognition properties, the maturation mechanisms comprising Variable/Diversity/Joining (VDJ) recombination, Variable Heavy (VH)/Variable Light (VL) chain pairing, variability at junctional site, and somatic hypermutation (SHM) of those antibodies were studied and compared with their predecessor germline sequences. IMGT/V-QUEST database was applied to analyze the isolated VH and VL sequences. To confirm the correction of isolated VH/VL, 3 HuMAbs (1A10H7, 1B3B9, 1G7C2) was transiently expressed in HEK293T cell. All three clones of the expressed recombinant IgG (rIgG) showed the same binding and neutralizing activity as same as those from hybridomas. The data obtained in this study will elucidate the properties of those HuMAbs for further genetic modification, and its binding epitopes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
