Viruses subvert or manipulate this cellular machinery to favor viral propagation and to evade host immune response. The UPS serves as a double-edged sword in viral pathogenesis: on the one hand, the UPS is utilized by many viruses to maintain proper function and level of viral proteins; while on the other hand, the UPS constitutes a host defense mechanism to eliminate viral components. To combat this host anti-viral machinery, viruses have evolved to employ the UPS to degrade or inactivate cellular proteins that limit viral growth. This review will highlight our current knowledge pertaining to the different roles for the UPS in viral pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
