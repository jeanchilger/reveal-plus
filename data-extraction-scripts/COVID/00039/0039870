<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>11 Social, cultural, and other diversity issues in the traumatic stress field</TITLE><BODY>This chapter describes how the impact of psychological trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) differ, depending on individual differences and the social and cultural context and culture-specific teachings and resources available to individuals, families, and communities. A social-ecological framework is used to differentiate the impact of exposure to traumatic stressors and the development of (or resistance to) PTSD, based on the individual’s or group’s (i) personal, unique physical characteristics, including skin color, racial background, gender, and sexual orientation; and (ii) family, ethnocultural, and community membership, including majority or minority group status, religious beliefs and practices, socioeconomic resources, and political and civic affiliations. While personal, familial, social, and cultural factors can be a positive resource contributing to safety and well-being, they also can be a basis for placing the person, group, or entire community or population in harm’s way or at heightened risk of developing PTSD.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
