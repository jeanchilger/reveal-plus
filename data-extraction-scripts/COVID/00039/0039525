There are numerous guidelines, but literature suggests that there is substantial variation in care in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Key components of acute therapy for most patients include oral steroids, antibiotics, nebulizers, oxygen, and early consideration of noninvasive ventilation. Adjuvant components of care include venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, appropriate immunizations, counseling for smoking cessation, and consideration of pulmonary rehabilitation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
