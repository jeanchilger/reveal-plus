Several murine model systems of virus infection have been used to identify clearance mechanisms. Quantitative analysis of Sindbis virus clearance over 6 months shows three phases: day 5-7, clearance of infectious virus, but continued presence of viral RNA; day 8-60, decreasing levels of viral RNA; day 60-180, maintenance of viral RNA at low levels. Antiviral antibody and interferon-γ have major roles in clearance with a likely role for IgM as well as IgG antibody. Long-term residence of virus-specific immune cells in the nervous system is necessary to prevent virus reactivation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
