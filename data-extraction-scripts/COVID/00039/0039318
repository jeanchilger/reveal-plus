This relationship allows the host to maintain the balance between active immunity to pathogens and vaccines and tolerance to self-antigens and food antigens. In children living in low-income and middle-income countries, undernourishment and repetitive gastrointestinal infections are associated with the failure of oral vaccines. Intestinal dysbiosis associated with these environmental influences, as well as some host-related factors, compromises immune responses and negatively impacts vaccine efficacy. To understand how immune responses to viral vaccines can be optimally modulated, mechanistic studies of the relationship between the microbiome, host genetics, viral infections and the development and function of the immune system are needed. We discuss the potential role of the microbiome in modulating vaccine responses in the context of a growing understanding of the relationship between the gastrointestinal microbiota, host related factors (including histo-blood group antigens) and resident immune cell populations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
