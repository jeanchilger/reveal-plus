The text includes descriptions of spontaneous and treatment-related lesions observed in the tissues in toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. The text begins with a description of the normal upper respiratory tract through the stages of embryonic development. Anatomy and histology are discussed before delving into the various degenerative, regenerative, and adaptive lesions found in toxicology studies. Included in the text is information on inflammatory and vascular lesions, and how trauma and injury, as well as exposure to irritants, can elicit inflammatory responses. Molecular pathology of the upper respiratory tract is investigated, as well as an examination of the molecular alterations within specific cell types, providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of tissue injury.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
