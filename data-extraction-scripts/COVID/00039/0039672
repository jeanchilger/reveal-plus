Virus was initially detected in tissues using a consensus herpesvirus PCR. No viral inclusions or particles had been evident in routine histologic or transmission electron microscopic sections of cloacal lesions. Virus was isolated from samples and transmission electron microscopy of the resulting isolates confirmed that the virus was morphologically consistent with a herpesvirus. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR product from tissue samples and from the isolates revealed that the virus was in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae and was distinct from other known herpesviruses. The correlation between the lesions and the novel virus remains unknown. Two herpesviruses, both in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, have previously been described in macropods and are known to cause systemic clinical disease. This is the first reported gammaherpesvirus within the order Marsupialia, and may provide valuable information regarding the evolution and phylogeny of this virus family. Based on current herpesvirus nomenclature convention, the authors propose the novel herpesvirus be named Macropodid herpesvirus 3 (MaHV-3).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
