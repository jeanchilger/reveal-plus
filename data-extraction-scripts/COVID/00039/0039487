<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-11-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Applications of nanotechnology in food packaging and food safety: Barrier materials, antimicrobials and sensors</TITLE><BODY>Abstract In this article, several applications of nanomaterials in food packaging and food safety are reviewed, including: polymer/clay nanocomposites as high barrier packaging materials, silver nanoparticles as potent antimicrobial agents, and nanosensors and nanomaterial-based assays for the detection of food-relevant analytes (gasses, small organic molecules and food-borne pathogens). In addition to covering the technical aspects of these topics, the current commercial status and understanding of health implications of these technologies are also discussed. These applications were chosen because they do not involve direct addition of nanoparticles to consumed foods, and thus are more likely to be marketed to the public in the short term.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
