METHOD A randomized, controlled trial with outcomes of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C), fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and patient satisfaction. Enrollment was staggered, with individuals assessed at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS Fifty-seven participants completed the study (20 control, 37 internet). Physiological outcomes were not statistically different between the 2 groups. However, within-group comparisons demonstrated a significant improvement in the internet group's A1C, TG and satisfaction levels from baseline to 3 and 6 months (p<0.0452, p<0.0428 and p<0.0138, respectively). CONCLUSION Although the trial was limited in sample size, it yielded significant findings for diabetes management, within group. Further research in using the internet program in other applications for diabetes management is needed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
