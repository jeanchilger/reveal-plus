Hence, it is important to understand the functioning and strategic decisions of these providers of public good resources. 2 2 Here we refer to public goods in a general way as goods which are relatively costly to exclude others from using, and, whose consumption by one user does not in a significant way reduce the quantity of the good available for others to use. The existing literature tends to use case studies of individual collections. This paper uses a unique worldwide survey of microbial collections to analyse the heterogeneity among culture collections, and to empirically assess the economic and institutional conditions that contribute to this heterogeneity with respect to conservation choice and associated industry spillovers. Results suggest that in the short run public-private partnerships may indeed support knowledge accumulation with particularly strong public good properties. It is important to be aware of this strong tie, in order to steer also the long term conservation patrimony into one that offers not only short term usability but also resilience to future unforeseen needs e.g. of emerging crop plagues.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
