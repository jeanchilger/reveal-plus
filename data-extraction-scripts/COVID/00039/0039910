This article reports a study investigating hand and environmental contamination levels when health care workers (HCWs) followed two different methods of removing gloves at two distances from the rubbish bin. METHODS: Fifty HCWs performed a personal or causal glove removal method (pretest) and a Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-recommended glove removal method (posttest) at distances of 2 feet and 3 feet from the rubbish bin after the application of fluorescent solution (the simulated contaminant) onto their gloved hands. RESULTS: The incidence of the small patch of fluorescent stain (<1 cm(2)) on the front of the doffed gloves was significantly lower in the posttest than in the pretest. The incidence of small and large patches (>1 cm(2)) on the front of the doffed gloves and on the cover of the rubbish bin was significantly lower at 3 feet than at 2 feet. Health care assistants had significantly higher levels of contamination than other HCWs in the pretest but not in the posttest. There was no significant difference in hand contamination rate between pretest and posttest based on distance from the rubbish bin and type of HCW. CONCLUSION: The impact of the glove removal procedure and the distance to the bin in which used gloves are discarded should be taken into consideration on a daily basis, along with the supervision of infection control measures by minor staff.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
