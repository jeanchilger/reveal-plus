Non-covalent MIP were synthesized using methacrylic acid (MAA), 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrilate (DMAEM) or 2-hydroxyethylmetacrylate (HEMA) as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as crosslinking agent. After the evaluation of the selectivity of the GL imprinted polymers, the performance of these materials as Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) sorbents was investigated. MIP having HEMA as functional monomer were found to be able to selectively extract almost 80% of GL content in liquorice roots. The proposed MISPE-HPLC procedure has good precision, thus it can be successfully used for the purification of GL from natural sources.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
