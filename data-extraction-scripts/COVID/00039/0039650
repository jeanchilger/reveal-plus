MBP-reactive encephalitogenic T cell lines were cytotoxic to 51Cr-labeled oligodendrocyte target cells derived from Lewis rat fetal brain-dissociated culture, when incubated for 6 h in the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and MBP ( percent 51 Cr release = 65±3% vs. spontaneous release = 22±3% vs. normal lymph node cells + APC and MBP = 20 ± 3%). This reaction is time dependent, likely MHC restricted, and is not just a nonspecific toxic effect against any Lewis target cells since neither fibroblasts nor astrocytes were affected. Other (tetanus toxoid-reactive) lymphoblasts stimulated by specific antigen were not cytotoxic to the oligodendrocytes. These findings suggest that oligodendrocytes might be target cells for MBP-reactive lymphocytes in EAE if antigen presentation is appropriate.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
