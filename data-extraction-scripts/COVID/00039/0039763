<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-07-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Protein-protein interactions of human viruses</TITLE><BODY>Viruses infect their human hosts by a series of interactions between viral and host proteins, indicating that detailed knowledge of such virus-host interaction interfaces are critical for our understanding of viral infection mechanisms, disease etiology and the development of new drugs. In this review, we primarily survey human host-virus interaction data that are available from public databases following the standardized PSI-MS format. Notably, available host-virus protein interaction information is strongly biased toward a small number of virus families including herpesviridae, papillomaviridae, orthomyxoviridae and retroviridae. While we explore the reliability and relevance of these protein interactions we also survey the current knowledge about viruses functional and topological targets. Furthermore, we assess emerging frontiers of host-virus protein interaction research, focusing on protein interaction interfaces of hosts that are infected by different viruses and viruses that infect multiple hosts. Finally, we cover the current status of research that investigates the relationships of virus-targeted host proteins to other comorbidities as well as the influence of host-virus protein interactions on human metabolism.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
