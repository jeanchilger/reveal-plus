Demyelination was observed in optic nerve fibres arising from the eyes of mice which received a single rTNF injection. No such changes were detected when heat-inactivated rTNF was injected with the label. The effects of intravitreal injection of rTNF on the pathophysiology of mouse optic nerve resembled those found in mice infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. We suggest that TNF could mediate at lease some of the pathophysiological changes found in SFV-infected mice and may provide a clue concerning the disease mechanism in multiple sclerosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
