In the present study, the host cell gene expression profiles altered by the GP4 and GP5 proteins were investigated by the use of DNA microarrays. Sublines of Marc-145 and HeLa cells were established by stable transfection with open reading frame (ORF)4 and ORF5 of PRRSV, respectively, and differential gene expressions were studied using microarray chips embedded with 1718 human-expressed sequence tags. The genes for protein degradation, protein synthesis and transport, and various other biochemical pathways were identified. No genes involved in the apoptosis pathway appeared to be regulated in GP5-expressing cells. The microarray data may provide insights into the specific cellular responses to the GP4 and GP5 proteins during PRRSV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
