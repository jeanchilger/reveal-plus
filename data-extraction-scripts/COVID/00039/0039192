In this study, feline kobuviruses were found in 13.5% of cats with diarrhoea, but not in asymptomatic animals. In the full-length genome, one such strains, TE/52/13/ITA, displayed the highest nucleotide identity (96.0%) to the prototype strain FK-13. These results provide firm evidence that kobuviruses are common constituents of feline enteric viroma and that they are not geographically restricted to the Asian continent, where they were first signalled.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
