All serum samples were collected from 24- to 26-week-old finishing pigs between December 1998 and June 1999. By ELISA, 237 out of 446 sera tested (53.1%) and 54 out of 88 sampled herds (61.3%) were positive against PRCV. Of 446 sera from 88 herd tested, 185 (41.5%) serum samples from 22 (25%) herds were seronegative against PRCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection. Our data suggested that seropositive herds for PRCV are distributed diffusely throughout South Korea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
