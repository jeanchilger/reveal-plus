Highly pathogenic strains of influenza A, such as H5N1, have the capacity to cause severe illness or death in ferrets. The use of ferrets as a model of influenza infection is currently limited by a lack of species-specific immunological reagents. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) plays a key role in the development of innate and adaptive immunity and the regulation of Th1-type immune responses. Here we describe the cloning of the full-length cDNA for ferret IFN-γ. Multiple sequence alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence with those of other species indicates that the predicted ferret protein shares the highest identity with Eurasian badger IFN-γ. We raised two hybridoma clones expressing monoclonal antibodies against recombinant ferret IFN-γ capable of detecting IFN-γ protein derived from mitogen-stimulated ferret PBMCs by immunoblotting, ELISA and ELISPOT assay. Finally, an ELISA utilizing the ferret-specific antibodies detected elevated levels of IFN-γ in serum samples from H3N2 influenza A-infected ferrets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
