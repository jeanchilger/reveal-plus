<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-12-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Novel isoxazolidine analogues of homonucleosides and homonucleotides</TITLE><BODY>Isoxazolidine analogues of homonucleos(t)ides were synthesized from nucleobase-derived nitrones 20a-20e (uracil, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, thymine, adenine) employing 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with allyl alcohol as well as with alkenylphosphonates (allyl-, allyloxymethyl- and vinyloxymethyl- and vinylphosphonate). Besides reactions with vinylphosphonate the additions proceeded regioselectively to produce mixtures of major cis and minor trans 3,5-disubstituted isoxazolidines (d.e. 28–82%). From vinylphosphonate up to 10% of 3,4-disubstituted isoxazolidines was additionally produced. Vicinal couplings, shielding effects and 2D NOE correlations were employed in configurational assignments as well as in conformational analysis to find out preferred conformations for several isoxazolidines and to observe anomeric effects (pseudoaxial orientation of phosphonylmethoxy groups) for those obtained from vinyloxymethylphosphonate. None of the tested compounds were endowed in vitro with antiviral activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses at subtoxic concentrations (up to 250 μM) nor exhibited antiproliferative activity towards L1210, CEM, and HeLa cells (IC(50) = ≥100 μM).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
