Epidemiology has focused on different environmental risk factors but certainly virus infection, smoking, vitamin D levels, and sunlight exposure are the most relevant. What is certainly less clear is the way in which these external factors are able to induce and sustain the internal pathology process of the disease. Epigenetics has been recently focused on trying to shed light on this aspect. As a matter of fact epigenetic changes are highly sensitive to environmental factors that therefore may influence the susceptibility to the disease by acting through epigenetic modifications. In this chapter we discuss the most relevant environmental factors and how they may affect the immune response in MS. Finally, we discuss the possible role of the microbiota in inducing autoimmunity in MS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
