Central nervous system inflammation, the presumed mechanism of influenza-associated encephalopathy, is difficult to detect. Characteristics of children presenting with severe neurological complications of influenza, and potential biomarkers of influenza-associated encephalopathy are described. Methods A multi-center, retrospective case-series of children with influenza and neurological complications during 2017 was performed. Enrolled cases met criteria for influenza-associated encephalopathy or had status epilepticus. Functional outcome at discharge was compared between groups using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results There were 22 children with influenza studied of whom 11/22 had encephalopathy and 11/22 had status epilepticus. Only one child had a documented influenza immunization. The biomarker CSF neopterin was tested in 10/11 children with encephalopathy and was elevated in 8/10. MRI was performed in all children with encephalopathy and was abnormal in 8 (73%). Treatment of children with encephalopathy was with corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin in 9/11 (82%). In all cases oseltamivir use was low (59%) while admission to the intensive care unit was frequent (14/22, 66%). Clinical outcome at discharge was moderate to severe disability (mRS score > 2) in the majority of children with encephalopathy (7/11, 64%), including one child who died. Children with status epilepticus recovered to near-baseline function in all cases. Conclusion Raised CSF neopterin was present in most cases of encephalopathy, and along with diffusion restriction on MRI, is a useful diagnostic biomarker. Lack of seasonal influenza vaccination represents a missed opportunity to prevent illness in children, including severe neurological disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
