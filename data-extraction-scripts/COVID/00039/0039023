IFNα-producing cells (IPC), which are present at a low frequency in the blood, could be enriched up to 100-fold by sequential depletion of plastic-adherent cells and cell fractionation on metrizamide density gradients. IPC were present in the non-adherent low-density cell subpopulation. Cell selection experiments using antibody (Ab)-coated immunomagnetic beads revealed that porcine IPC could be positively selected by anti-CD4 or -SLA-class-II Ab, but not by anti-CD2 or -CD8 Ab. The estimated IFN yield per IPC was found to increase when IPC were assayed at higher concentrations. These data suggest that IPC represent a unique and distinct cell population in the blood, which could secrete higher amounts of IFN following its accumulation at a site of viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
