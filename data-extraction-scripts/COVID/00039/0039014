Particularly, Ag NPs have much attention owing to their distinctive optical, chemical, electrical and catalytic properties that can be tuned with surface nature, size, shapes, etc. and hence these crystals have been used in various fields such as catalysis, sensor, electronic components, antimicrobial agents in the health industry etc. Among them, Ag NPs based disinfectants have paid attention due to the practical applications in our daily life. Therefore the Ag NPs have been used in different sectors such as silver-based air/water filters, textile, animal husbandry, biomedical and food packaging etc. In this review, the Ag NPs as a disinfectant in different sectors have been included in detail.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
