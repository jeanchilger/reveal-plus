The enteric nervous system and infectious diarrhea</TITLE><BODY>Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the background knowledge about the enteric nervous system (ENS) as well as the role of ENS in secretory states of the small intestine. The chapter describes the anatomy and physiology of the ENS. A description of the experimental evidence for the involvement of ENS in secretory states of the gut, primarily in cholera toxin-induced secretion that is the most thoroughly investigated secretory state, is presented in the chapter. The chapter focuses on the involvement of ENS in rotavirus (RV) diarrhea. The involvement of the ENS in diarrhea pathophysiology opens up new potential sites of action for drugs in the treatment of intestinal secretory states. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the sites of action for the pharmacological treatment of diarrhea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
