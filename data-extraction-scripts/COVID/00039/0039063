Over the past decade, progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Alloimmune factors and nonalloimmune factors may contribute to its development. Understanding the precise mechanism of each type of chronic allograft dysfunction may open up the field for new preventive and therapeutic interventions. This article reviews major new insights into the clinical aspects, pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnosis, and management of chronic allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
