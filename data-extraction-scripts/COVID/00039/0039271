Employing the theory of differential inequalities, we find sufficient conditions for the permanence of the system. Further, we use Lyapunov’s functional method to obtain sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability of the system. We observe that the permanence of the system is unaffected due to presence of incubation delay. However, incubation delay affects the global stability of the positive periodic solution of the system. To reinforce the analytical results and to get more insight into the system’s behavior, we perform some numerical simulations of the autonomous and nonautonomous systems with and without time delay. We observe that for the gradual increase in the magnitude of incubation delay, the autonomous system develops limit cycle oscillation through a Hopf-bifurcation while the corresponding nonautonomous system shows chaotic dynamics through quasi-periodic oscillations. We apply basic tools of non-linear dynamics such as Poincaré section and maximum Lyapunov exponent to confirm the chaotic behavior of the system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
