For this purpose, a total of 30 calves were infected experimentally with E. zuernii oocysts and faecal samples taken regularly from the rectum and examined for faecal consistency and oocyst excretion. Six of the calves underwent pathological examination at various points in time after infection. Significant macroscopic and microscopic changes were demonstrated and parasitic stages were identified in the intestinal mucosa of infected calves during the late prepatent and patent period. Inflammatory reactions revealed by light microscopy were confirmed by electron microscopical investigations. Treatment of calves with toltrazuril during the late prepatent period resulted in significantly lower frequencies of diarrhoea and levels of oocyst excretion, and weight gain was significantly higher than in shamtreated animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
