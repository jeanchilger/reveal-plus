The simulation results by CTM show that the increments of annual heating and cooling may differ up to 10s of times or even more than 100 times in different cities for the same building with the same increase of ventilation rates, while the annual heating and cooling RVRs are both approximate in different cities. For the same building with the same increase of ventilation rate in the same city, its annual heating RVRs are far higher than its annual cooling RVRs. The above conclusion can be reached for any building whether with various envelopes or with different shape coefficients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
