Certain epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory findings appear to be helpful in distinguishing gastroenteritis due to HRVLA from other causes in those children sick enough to require hospitalization. Age: 76% of infants and children seven through 12 months of age and 76% of those 13 through 24 months of age had infection with the HRVLA, whereas such infection was found in only 21% of infants under six months of age and 23% of children 25 through 60 months of age. Time of Year: 61% of patients studied during the cooler months had HRVLA infection and such infection was not found from June to October. Frequency of vomiting and dehydration: Twice as many patients infected with HRVLA as those who were not had vomiting (92%) and significant dehydration (83%).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
