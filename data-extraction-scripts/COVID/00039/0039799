High virological level of safety has been achieved mainly by improving not only the qualification of donors and methods used for donor screening, but also applying leukoreduction, pathogen reduction technology and grace period for serum. In this article, we discuss the improvement of the epidemic situation among blood donors for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the increasing trend for HIV. Preliminary results of residual risk calculation for these pathogens are presented. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and Babesia microti were considered as new factors potentially relevant for the safety of blood transfusion in our country. Due to evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in the ecosystem in Poland, it is also necessary to monitor the infections with this pathogen. In this article, it was emphasized that the reporting of all possible complications associated with transfusion and meticulous implementation of the look-back procedure play a key role for monitoring the risk of transmission of infectious agents by blood. It is especially important in view of the increasing epidemiological problems associated with emerging infectious agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
