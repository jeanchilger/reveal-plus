Two general types of RNA granules are conserved from yeast to mammals: stress granules (SGs), which contain many translation initiation factors, and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are enriched for proteins involved in RNA turnover. Because of the inverse relationship between appearance of RNA granules and persistence of translation, many viruses must subvert RNA granule function for replicative purposes. Here we discuss the viruses and mechanisms that manipulate stress granules and P-bodies to promote synthesis of viral proteins. Several themes have emerged for manipulation of RNA granules by viruses: (1) disruption of RNA granules at the mid-phase of infection, (2) prevention of RNA granule assembly throughout infection and (3) co-opting of RNA granule proteins for new or parallel roles in viral reproduction. Viruses must employ one or multiple of these routes for a robust and productive infection to occur. The possible role for RNA granules in promoting innate immune responses poses an additional reason why viruses must counteract the effects of RNA granules for efficient replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
