Because of the harm that parasites can inflict on man and domesticated animals, which can be expressed as economic loss, many parasites become pests. In natural ecosystems, parasites contribute to the prevention of continuous exponential growth of populations and, therefore, they also need to be conserved. The exotic pet trade may result in translocation of exotic species together with their microparasites and macroparasites, potentiating a risk of transmission of exotic diseases to native fauna and to humans. Within this context we need to increase our knowledge of parasites and parasitic diseases of wildlife. Prevention seems to be the choice for managing parasite exposure. This may be achieved through educational programs that refocused on discouraging people to import exotic pets, together with stronger legislative measures to control wildlife trade.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
