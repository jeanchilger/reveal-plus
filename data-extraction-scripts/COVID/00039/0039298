Two trials were conducted with two separate hatches of turkey poults. Turkeys were experimentally immunosuppressed with cyclosporin A (CsA) or cyclophosphamide (CY) and infected with TCV. Prior to infection, treatment with CsA selectively suppressed T cell activity as revealed by 2–3 fold decreased (p<0.1) lymphocyte proliferation responses to a T cell mitogen, concanavalin A (Con A). Treatment with CY mainly induced B cell deficiency as indicated by significant reductions (p<0.05) in antibody responses to sheep erythrocytes 7 days after injection. Body weight gain of turkeys treated with CY was significantly lower (p<0.05) than that of untreated turkeys at 9 days post-infection (PI). Turkeys treated with CY had 1–2 fold higher immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) scores for TCV antigens (p<0.05) in the intestine than untreated turkeys at 9 or 14 days PI. These results suggested that humoral immunity against TCV infection may be important in turkeys.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
