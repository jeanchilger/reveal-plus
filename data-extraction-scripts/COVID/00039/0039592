These assays are also useful for studying other receptor-activated viral fusion proteins. When one viral glycoprotein and one “simple” host cell receptor are involved, it should be possible to develop assays directly analogous to those described above for studying Tva-induced binding of the EnvA ectodomain (EnvA-PI) to target membranes. A general prerequisite for a fusion protein/target membrane binding assay is a soluble and correctly oligomeric form of the viral fusion protein ectodomain. The simplest host cell receptors that would be amenable to this type of analysis are type I or type II integral membrane proteins. The soluble versions of the ectodomains of these receptors, produced by genetic engineering or proteolytic release, could then be used to trigger the cognate fusion protein. The methodology could, similarly, be applicable to multimembrane-spanning host cell receptors when the functional part of the receptor is tethered at only one end or where an ectodomain loop preserves enough structure to function as a soluble analog, perhaps by generating a cyclic peptide analog of the loop. The same “receptor reagents” could be employed for intact virus particle/target membrane binding assays.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
