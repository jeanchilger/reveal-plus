No MERS vaccines are licensed for human use, reinforcing the urgency to develop safe and efficacious vaccines to prevent MERS. MERS-CoV spike protein forms a trimer, and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) serves as a vaccine target. Nevertheless, the protective efficacy of RBD in its native trimeric form has never been evaluated. In this study, a trimeric protein, RBD-Fd, was generated by fusing RBD with foldon trimerization motif. It bound strongly to the receptor of MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and elicited robust RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, maintaining long-term neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection. RBD-Fd potently protected hDPP4 transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. These results suggest that MERS-CoV RBD in its trimeric form maintains native conformation and induces protective neutralizing antibodies, making it a candidate for further therapeutic development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
