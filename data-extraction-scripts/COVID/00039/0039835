With the determined 183 translation probabilities and amino-acid composition of eight highly mutated proteins, we construct the theoretical distributions of mutated amino acids in these proteins and then compare them with their actual distributions affected by mutations. Thereafter we trace the pattern of translation probabilities from RNA codons to mutated amino acids of 1053 point missense mutations. Finally, we statistically conclude that the natural mutation trend goes along the theoretical translation probability.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
