Recently, RNA interference (RNAi) has reinvigorated the therapeutic prospects for inhibiting gene expression and promises many advantages over binding inhibitors, including high specificity, which is essential for targeted therapeutics. This article describes the latest developments using small-interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibitors to downregulate various angiogenic and tumor-associated factors, both in cell-culture assays and in animal disease models. The majority of research efforts are currently focused on understanding gene function, as well as proof-of-concept for siRNA-mediated anti-angiogenesis. The prospects for siRNA therapeutics, both advantages and looming hurdles, are evaluated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
