<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-12-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Fatal multiorgan failure due to yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease</TITLE><BODY>Yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) is a rare complication of yellow fever (YF) vaccination. A previously healthy 22-year-old female died following YF vaccination despite aggressive measures. Serial viral load titers, cytokine levels and host genetic factors were evaluated in an attempt to understand this unusual and lethal outcome. The patient's high-titer vaccine viremia and possibly related minor genetic anomalies provide clues to exploring the etiology of YEL-AVD.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
