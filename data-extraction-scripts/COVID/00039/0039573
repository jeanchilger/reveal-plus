One of these, 3c, a 12.4K protein encoded by the third open reading frame of the tricistronic mRNA3 was clearly detectable and was found to cofractionate with virion envelope proteins on detergent disruption of virus particles. These results, together with the hydrophobic nature of 3c and its previously demonstrated association with the membranes of infected cells, suggest strongly that 3c represents a new virion envelope protein, which may have counterparts in other coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
