Along with basic understanding of germ theory and sanitation, vaccination, over the past 50 years, has transformed lives and economies in both rich and poor countries by its direct impact on human and animal life—resulting in the eradication of small pox, huge reductions in the burden of previously common human and animal diseases such as polio, typhoid, measles in human medicine and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, screwworm and hog cholera and the verge of eradicating brucellosis, tuberculosis, and pseudorabies in veterinary medicine. In addition vaccination along with other animal production changes has provided the ability to produce otherwise unaffordable animal protein and animal health worldwide. The landscape however on which vaccinology was discovered and applied over the past 200 years, even in the past 10 years has and is undergoing continuous change. For vaccination as a public health tool to have its greatest impacts in human and veterinary medicine, these great medical sciences will have to come together, policy-relevant science for sustainable conservation in developing and developed countries needs to become the norm and address poverty (including lack of basic health care) in communities affected by conservation, and to consider costs and benefits (perceived or not) affecting the well-being of all stakeholders, from the local to the multinational. The need to return to and/or develop new education-based models for turning the tide from the heavily return-on-investment therapeutic era of the last century into one where the investment into the preventative sciences and medicine lead to sustainable cultural and cost-effective public health and economic changes of the future is never more evident than today. The new complex problems of the new millennium will require new educational models that train para- and professional people for thinking and solving complex inter-related biological, ecological, public-, political/economic problems. The single profession that is best positioned to impact vaccinology is Veterinary Medicine. It’s melding with human medicine and their role in future comparative and conservation-based programs will be critical to the successful application of vaccines into the 21st century.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
