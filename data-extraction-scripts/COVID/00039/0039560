<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-11-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Assessment of Medication Dispensing and Extended Community Pharmacy Services</TITLE><BODY>Individuals who visit community pharmacies are regarded as customers rather than patients. The public tends to view community pharmacists as businesspeople. Several factors influence individuals' willingness to patronize and to continue visiting such pharmacies.

Pharmacists need to realize their opportunities and potential for success as both professionals and businesspeople.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
