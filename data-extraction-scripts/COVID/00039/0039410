Bats are natural reservoir hosts to a variety of RNA viruses that cause significant morbidity and mortality in other species; however the mechanisms responsible for the control of viral replication in bats are not understood. This report describes the molecular cloning and expression analysis of RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 genes in the fruit bat Pteropus alecto, and is the first description of RIG-I like helicases from any species of bat. Our results demonstrate that P. alecto RIG-I, mda5 and LGP2 have similar primary structures and tissue expression patterns to their counterparts in humans and other mammals. Stimulation of bat kidney cells with synthetic dsRNA (poly I:C) induced high levels of interferon β and rapid upregulation of all three helicases. These findings reveal that the cytoplasmic virus sensing machinery is present and intact in P. alecto. This study provides the foundation for further investigations into the interactions between bat RIG-I-like helicases and viruses to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the asymptomatic nature of viral infections in bats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
