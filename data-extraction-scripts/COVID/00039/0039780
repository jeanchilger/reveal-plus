Three series of structurally modified analogues, involving substitutions at the N- and C-terminus, and at the C-terminal side-chain were synthesized and evaluated for antiviral activity. Aliphatic or no substituents at the C-carboxamide group, an aliphatic C-terminal side-chain, as well as a benzyloxycarbonyl moiety at the N-terminus were absolute requirements for anti-HCMV activity. The conformational restriction induced by the 2-azetidine residue into the dipeptide derivatives, identified by 1H NMR as a γ-type reverse turn, seems to have influence on the activity of these molecules.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
