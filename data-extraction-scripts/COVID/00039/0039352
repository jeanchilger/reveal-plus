Since the appropriate virus could not be isolated in cell culture the open reading frame of the viral capsid protein was cloned to generate a recombinant baculovirus. The protein was purified and used as an experimental vaccine in broiler breeders to provide maternal derived antibodies for the protection of the offspring. The presence of specific antibodies was monitored by an ELISA. The offspring of vaccinated breeder hens were partially protected in a RSS challenge model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
