Nevertheless, there are few well-designed, controlled studies in this population, which makes it difficult to understand the importance, behaviour and management of these viruses in immunocompromised children. New diagnostic techniques in PCR-based microbiology, could provide many opportunities for early diagnosis, preventing the spread of the virus and to implement the correct therapy. It is important to design appropriate prospective studies to assess these types of infections in children with cancer. In this review we analyse the main studies published in the literature, evaluating the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of children with cancer and respiratory viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
