First discovered in L. vannamei from Brazilian aquaculture farms in 2003, IMNV was additionally confirmed in L. vannamei from Indonesian farms in 2006 and has since been found in numerous provinces there. Only two complete sequences of IMNV strains have been reported to date, one strain from the Brazilian state of Piauí collected in 2003 and another from the Indonesian province of East Java collected in 2006. In this study, we determined the complete sequences of two additional Indonesian strains, one from Lampung province collected in 2011 and another from East Java province collected in 2012. We also determined partial sequences for six other strains to enhance phylogenetic comparisons, which have heretofore been limited by the small number of reported sequences, including only one for an Indonesian strain. The new results demonstrate clear genetic diversification of IMNV between Indonesia and Brazil, as well as within Indonesia. Analyses of conserved sequence motifs suggest a revised RNA pseudoknot prediction for ribosomal frameshifting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
