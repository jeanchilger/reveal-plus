The turbulent airflow was simulated by large eddy simulation (LES) using the MRT-LB method with the Smagorinsky model. This method was verified by comparing it with experimental and other numerical results. Good agreement was observed between airflow simulation and experimental data. It is also demonstrated that the LES carried out by the MRT-LB method can produce airflow results very similar to the RNG LES and provide better prediction than the standard and RNG k–ε models. In order to further improve the efficiency of the MRT-LB method, the multi-block grid refinement (MBGR) technique was used. The accuracy and efficiency of the MBGR and the consistency of physical quantities across the interface were investigated. In simulation of particle dispersion in the model room, particles with diameters of 1 and 10 µm were considered. It is shown that this model can successfully capture dispersion characteristics of particles.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
