Purinergic receptor P2X7 has been reported to be upstream of NLRP3 activation. However, the therapeutic implication of P2X7 in ALI remains to be explored. The present study used lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model to investigate the therapeutic potential of P2X7 blockage in ALI. Our results showed that P2X7/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway was significantly upregulated in the lungs of ALI mice as compared with control mice. P2X7 antagonist A438079 suppressed NLRP3/ASC/caspase 1 activation, production of IL-1β, IL-17A and IFN-γ and neutrophil infiltration but not the production of IL-10, resulting in a significant amelioration of lung injury. Moreover, blockage of P2X7 significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in bone marrow derived macrophages. Similar results were obtained using another P2X7 inhibitor brilliant blue G (BBG) in vivo. Thus, pharmacological blockage of P2X7/NLRP3 pathway can be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with ALI.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
