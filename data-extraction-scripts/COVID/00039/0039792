To identify region(s) of the N molecule required for pseudoparticle formation, we performed biochemical analysis of the interaction of N mutants and M in HEK293 cells. Using a peptide library derived from N, we found that amino acids 101–115 constituted a novel binding site for M. We examined the ability of N mutants to interact with M and form pseudoparticles, and our observations indicated that M bound to NΔ(101–115), N1–150, N151–300, and N301–422, but not to N1–150Δ(101–115). However, pseudoparticles were formed when NΔ(101–115) or N301–422, but not N1–150 or N151–300, were expressed with M in HEK293 cells. These results indicated that the minimum portion of N required for the interaction with M and pseudoparticle formation consists of amino acids 301–422.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
