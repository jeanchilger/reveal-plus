We compared the performance of the AdvanSure assay with the Seeplex RV 12 ACE detection kit (Seeplex; Seegene, Seoul, South Korea), a multiplex end-point PCR assay. A total of 454 consecutive respiratory specimens were tested with both AdvanSure and Seeplex assays; AdvanSure detected 153 (33.7%) positive cases and Seeplex detected 145 (31.9%) positive cases. The positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and kappa value for the two assays were 87.2% (95% CI, 80.3–92.1), 91.1% (95% CI, 87.2–93.9), and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70–0.83), respectively. Compared with the Seeplex assay, the AdvanSure assay had a shorter turnaround time (3h vs. 8h) and a shorter hands-on time (<1h vs 2h). In conclusion, the AdvanSure assay demonstrated comparable performance to the Seeplex assay.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
