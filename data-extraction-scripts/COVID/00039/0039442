There are few virus glycoproteins that provide prototypes for illustrating important relationships between the functions and glycoprotein structure. The discussion presented in the chapter concentrates on those viral glycoproteins that (1) span the lipid bilayer once, (2) are oriented such that the carboxy terminus comprises the cytoplasmic domain, and (3) contain asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. There are also viral glycoproteins with extensive O-linked glycosylation, some of which are also presented in the discussion. The chapter also focuses on the studies involving directed mutagenesis and construction of chimeric proteins. The effects of altering specific amino acid sequences, of swapping domains, and of adding a new domain to a protein serve to define the functions of a domain and to show that a domain can be independently associated with a specific function. The experiments described have been carried out by inserting the genes of particular viral glycoproteins—such as cDNAs—into expression vectors and transcribing the cDNAs from the promoter provided by the expression vector. This approach established that localization and functions such as the fusogenic activity are properties of the viral glycoprotein per se and do not require other viral-coded components.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
