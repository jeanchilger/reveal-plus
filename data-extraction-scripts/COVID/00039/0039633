Vaccination with LBSap induced a prominent type 1 immune response that was characterized by increased levels of interleukin (IL-) 12 and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) upon stimulation with soluble vaccine antigen. Importantly, results showed that this type of responsiveness was sustained after challenge infection; at day 90 and 885 after L. chagasi challenge infection, PBMCs from LBSap vaccinated dogs produced more IL-12, IFN-γ and concomitant nitric oxide (NO) when stimulated with Leishmania antigens as compared to PBMCs from respective control groups (saponin, LB- treated, or non-treated control dogs). Moreover, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β decreased in the supernatant of SLcA-stimulated PBMCs in the LBSap group at 90 days. Bone marrow parasitological analysis revealed decreased frequency of parasitism in the presence of vaccine antigen. It is concluded that vaccination of dogs with LBSap vaccine induced a long-lasting type 1 immune response against L. chagasi challenge infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
