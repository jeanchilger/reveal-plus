Eighty-four respiratory viruses identified by laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription–PCR assays (LDA) or by viral cultures were mixed and tested by FilmArray to assess its performance. FilmArray identified 72 (90%) of 80 viruses also detected by LDA. Six of the 8 viruses not detected by FilmArray had PCR cycle threshold values >35. Compared to LDA, FilmArray showed comparable sensitivity when used to test serial dilutions of virus mixtures and good agreement with negative samples. With the use of 1 FilmArray instrument, 7 clinical samples could be analyzed and reported in an 8-h shift compared to 20 using LDA and 1 real-time detection instrument. While the FilmArray was rapid and easy to use, its low throughput and qualitative results may be a disadvantage in some clinical settings.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
