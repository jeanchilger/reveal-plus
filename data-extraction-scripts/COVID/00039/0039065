We examined the in vitro translation property of the conserved MHV 5′leader RNA sequence by constructing chimeric mRNAs in which the 72-nt 5′-leader of M protein mRNA (A59 strain) was positioned upstream of the human α-globin coding region in a T7 expression vector. Synthetic 5′-capped transcripts of these mRNA constructs were translated in cell-free extracts prepared from uninfected and MHV-infected murine DBT cells. Nonviral mRNAs translated readily in both uninfected and infected cell-free extracts. By contrast, replacement of the human α-globin 5′-untranslated region (UR) with the MHV 5′-leader increased translation ca. three- to fourfold in cell-free extracts from MHV-infected cells versus translation in extracts from uninfected cells. Chimeric globin mRNA containing the reverse complementary sequence of the viral leader RNA in the 5′-UR showed no such increase in translation, indicating sequence specificity for the effect. A 13-nt region (-UCUAAUCCAAACA-) immediately proximal to the start codon was found to be important for the increased translation of the MHV leader-containing mRNAs. These data indicate that the apparent down-regulation of host translation is not primarily due to an inhibition of host translation but also involves a significant stimulation of viral translation in cis by a structural feature of the MHV 5′-leader RNA sequence in conjunction with a virus-specified or virus-induced factor.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
