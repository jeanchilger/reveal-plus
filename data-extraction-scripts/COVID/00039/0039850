<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-04-14</DATELINE><TITLE>VIRUSES | Introduction</TITLE><BODY>Several virus types can contaminate food, with the consequent possibility of human infection. The most common foodborne virus is norovirus, with hepatitis A and hepatitis E viruses also being prominent. Food can be directly contaminated with viruses by infected handlers, and also indirectly by, for example, polluted water used for irrigation or washing. Routine screening of foodstuffs for virus contamination is seldom performed, and may not be wholly cost-effective. Prevention of contamination through risk management of critical control points is more realistic, but physical means of virus elimination will always be required in case of failure of procedural controls. Much research remains necessary before the global challenge of foodborne viruses will be met.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
