Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral swelling of the hippocampus with T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancing image, suggesting hippocampal necrosis. The cat completely recovered after treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AED) and administration of prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO q24h for 4 days and tapered). However, cluster seizures reoccurred and developed into status epilepticus despite increasing doses of AED. Although the convulsions were resolved by other AEDs, stupor and renal failure developed, and the cat was euthanized. Pathological findings were consistent with hippocampal necrosis. Immunological analysis for leucine‐rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) autoantibodies was negative, but antibodies against DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma) known as netrin‐1 receptor were found. This report describes a case of feline autoimmune limbic encephalitis and hippocampal necrosis that were presumably associated with DCC autoantibodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
