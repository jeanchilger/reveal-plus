Minor glycoproteins of Arteriviruses are responsible for virus entry and cellular tropism. The experimental methods for studying minor Arterivirus proteins are limited because of the lack of antibodies and nested open reading frames (ORFs). In this study, we generated recombinant EAV with separated ORFs 3 and 4, and Gp3 carrying HA-tag (Gp3-HA). The recombinant viruses were stable on passaging and replicated in titers similar to the wild-type EAV. Gp3-HA was incorporated into the virion particles as monomers and as a Gp2/Gp3-HA/Gp4 trimer. Gp3-HA localized in ER and, to a lesser extent, in the Golgi, it also co-localized with the E protein but not with the N protein. The co-localization of Gp3-HA and the E protein with ERGIC was reduced. Moreover, EAV with Gp3-HA could become a valuable research tool for identifying host cell factors during infection and the role of Gp3 in virus attachment and entry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
