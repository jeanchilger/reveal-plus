Eighty healthy male SPF mice aged 6 weeks were selected and 20 mice were randomly selected as the blank group. The blank group did not receive any intervention. Mortality rates of each group were recorded and compared on day 8 of modeling, and heart specimens from the remaining mice were histopathologically examined and the expression of mRNA and protein of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in myocardial tissues were detected by western blot analysis. Correlation between mouse myocardial histopathologic scores and expression of protein of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in myocardial tissues, as well as the expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in myocardial tissue in VMC mice was analyzed. The expression levels of myocardial histopathological scores, mRNA and protein of TNF-α and TGF-β1 in the blank and control group were significantly lower than those in the VMC and the MG-132 group. The myocardial histopathological scores, mRNA and TNF-α and TGF-β1 protein in the MG-132 group were significantly lower than those in the VMC group (P<0.05). The expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1 protein in myocardial tissues was positively correlated with the pathological score in myocardial tissue of mice (r=0.843, P<0.05; r=0.763, P<0.05), and there was a positive correlation between the expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1 protein in myocardial tissues of VMC mice (r=0.672, P<0.05). UPS inhibitor MG-132, which can significantly alleviate the myocardial injury of VMC mice, reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in myocardial tissues, and improved the survival rate of mice, thus it is a potential new treatment for VMC.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
