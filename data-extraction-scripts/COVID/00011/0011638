<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-09-09</DATELINE><TITLE>A versatile platform technology for recombinant vaccines using non-propagative human parainfluenza virus type 2 vector</TITLE><BODY>Ectopic protein with proper steric structure was efficiently loaded onto the envelope of the F gene-defective BC-PIV vector derived from human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) by a reverse genetics method of recombinant virus production. Further, ectopic antigenic peptide was successfully loaded either outside, inside, or at both sides of the envelope of the vector. The BC-PIV vector harboring the Ebola virus GP gene was able to elicit neutralizing antibodies in mice. In addition, BC-PIV with antigenic epitopes of both melanoma gp100 and WT1 tumor antigen induced a CD8+ T-cell-mediated response in tumor-transplanted syngeneic mice. Considering the low pathogenicity and recurrent infections of parental hPIV2, BC-PIV can be used as a versatile vector with high safety for recombinant vaccine development, addressing unmet medical needs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
