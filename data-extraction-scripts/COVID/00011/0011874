Currently available PEDV vaccine strains have limited protective effects against PEDV variant strains. METHODS: In this study, the highly virulent epidemic virus strain CT was serially passaged in Vero cells for up to 120 generations (P120). Characterization of the different passages revealed that compared with P10 and P64, P120 had a higher viral titer and more obvious cytopathic effects, thereby demonstrating better cell adaptability. RESULTS: Pathogenicity experiments using P120 in piglets revealed significant reductions in clinical symptoms, histopathological lesions, and intestinal PEDV antigen distribution; the piglet survival rate in the P120 group was 100%. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing identified 13 amino acid changes in P120, which might be responsible for the attenuated virulence of P120. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, an attenuated strain was obtained via cell passaging and that this strain could be used in preparing attenuated vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
