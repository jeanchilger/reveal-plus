Primary clinical findings included a large, multi lobulated mass in the caudodorsal abdomen, peripheral eosinophilia and hyperglobulinemia. Abdominal imaging revealed a multilobulated, cavitated mass in the sublumbar region. Exploratory celiotomy revealed multiple firm masses in the sublumbar retroperitoneal space causing ventral displacement and compression of the descending colon with extension of the masses into the pelvic canal. Histopathology was consistent with feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia (FGESF). Aerobic culture was positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The cat was treated with prednisolone (2 mg/kg PO q24h), lactulose (0.5 g/kg PO q8h), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (62.5 mg/cat PO q12h for 1 month) and fenbendazole (50 mg/kg PO q24h for 5 days). Six months postoperatively, the cat had no recurrence of clinical signs. Repeat evaluation and imaging at day 732 postoperatively revealed marked improvement of the abdominal mass, resolution of peripheral eosinophilia and no clinical signs with continued prednisolone therapy (0.5 mg/kg PO q24h). RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: This is a report of a primary extramural FGESF lesion, and the first description of characteristics of FGESF on CT. Previous evidence suggests that the most favorable outcomes require immunosuppressive therapy and complete surgical excision; however, this case demonstrates a favorable outcome with medical management alone.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
