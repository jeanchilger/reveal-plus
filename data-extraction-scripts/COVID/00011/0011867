Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment. METHODS: 3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Dudleya brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with oil red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h. RESULTS: The ROS production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. The PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, fatty acid synthase mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights and directions for further research relating to the immunity of porcine respiratory system, by employing a model based on alveolar macrophages and natural materials.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
