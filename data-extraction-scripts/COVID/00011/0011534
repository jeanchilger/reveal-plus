<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-08-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation of a proximal urethral stricture caused by a urethral membrane in a female cat</TITLE><BODY>CASE SUMMARY: A proximal urethral stricture was diagnosed by retrograde urethrogram in a 2-year-old female neutered cat, which was referred following a 2-month history of stranguria, pollakiuria and urinary incontinence. Cystoscopic examination confirmed the presence of a severe narrowing of the proximal urethra near to the bladder neck, consisting of a membrane arising from the urethral mucosa. Fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation was performed. Twelve months after the procedure, the cat did not show any recurrence of clinical signs. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a proximal urethral stricture in a cat. Management by fluoroscopy-guided balloon dilation proved to be a successful and minimally invasive option with an excellent outcome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
