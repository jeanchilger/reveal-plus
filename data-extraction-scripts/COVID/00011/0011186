<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-05-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Exploring Australian Hajj Tour Operators’ Knowledge and Practices Regarding Pilgrims’ Health Risks: A Qualitative Study</TITLE><BODY>BACKGROUND: Travel agents are known to be one of the main sources of health information for pilgrims, and their advice is associated with positive health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate travel agents’ health knowledge, what health advice they provide to the pilgrims, and their sources of health information. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted among specialist Hajj travel agents in Sydney, Australia. Thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Of the 13 accredited Hajj travel agents, 9 (69%) were interviewed. A high level of awareness regarding gastrointestinal infections, standard hygiene methods, and the risk of injury was noted among the participants and was included in advice provided to pilgrims. However, very limited knowledge and provision of advice about the risk of respiratory infections was identified. Knowledge of the compulsory meningococcal vaccine was high, and all participated travel agents reported influenza vaccine (a recommended vaccine) as a second “compulsory” vaccine for Hajj visas. Conversely, participants reported very limited knowledge about other recommended vaccines for Hajj. The Ministry of Hajj website and personal Hajj experience were the main sources of information. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies a potential path for novel health promotion strategies to improve health knowledge among Hajj travel agents and subsequently among Hajj pilgrims.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
