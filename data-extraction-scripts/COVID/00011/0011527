To gain insight into virus-host interactions, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen. The expression of over 20,000 cellular genes was individually knocked down in human airway epithelial A549 cells, followed by infection with RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Knockdown of expression of the cellular ATP1A1 protein, which is the major subunit of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase of the plasma membrane, had one of the strongest inhibitory effects on GFP expression and viral titer. Inhibition was not observed for vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating that it was RSV-specific rather than a general effect. ATP1A1 formed clusters in the plasma membrane very early following RSV infection, which was independent of replication but dependent on the attachment glycoprotein G. RSV also triggered activation of ATP1A1, resulting in signaling by c-Src-kinase activity that transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by Tyr845 phosphorylation. ATP1A1 signaling and activation of both c-Src and EGFR were found to be required for efficient RSV uptake. Signaling events downstream of EGFR culminated in the formation of macropinosomes. There was extensive uptake of RSV virions into macropinosomes at the beginning of infection, suggesting that this is a major route of RSV uptake, with fusion presumably occurring in the macropinosomes rather than at the plasma membrane. Important findings were validated in primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC). In A549 cells and HSAEC, RSV uptake could be inhibited by the cardiotonic steroid ouabain and the digitoxigenin derivative PST2238 (rostafuroxin) that bind specifically to the ATP1A1 extracellular domain and block RSV-triggered EGFR Tyr845 phosphorylation. In conclusion, we identified ATP1A1 as a host protein essential for macropinocytic entry of RSV into respiratory epithelial cells, and identified PST2238 as a potential anti-RSV drug.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
