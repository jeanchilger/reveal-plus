Worldwide, the 2017-18 epidemic proved to be the most severe since 2003-04. We report a real-world experience regarding the management of patients with influenza admitted to a large teaching hospital in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region during the 2017-2018 influenza season. We also provide a practical guide for the management of hospitalized influenza patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis was conducted among all influenza patients requiring admission to our center during the 2017-18 season. RESULTS: Overall, 29 patients were admitted to the University Hospital of Udine during the 2017-18 season with a diagnosis of influenza. B virus was responsible for the majority of cases. More than 65.5% of the subjects presented with a complication. We estimated that 41.4% of the patients admitted were affected by a “severe form”. All these cases required admission to the Intensive Care Unit, with 27.6% and 10.3% needing Orotracheal Intubation and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, respectively. The fatality rate was 24.1%. Notably, only 9 subjects in our cohort had been vaccinated. Based on the experience acquired during the past season, we propose a practical guide to the management of influenza cases in everyday hospital practice. CONCLUSION: The cornerstones of the management of all hospitalized influenza patients are the rapid identification and treatment of severe forms. Timely and strict adherence to contact and respiratory precautions are also fundamental to reducing the risk of intra-hospital outbreaks. Despite improvements in antiviral therapies and supportive measures, influenza-related morbidity and mortality remain high. In our opinion, a universal vaccination program is the only safe and effective method of filling the gap.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
