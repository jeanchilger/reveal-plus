The development of prophylactics and therapeutics is urgently needed to prevent and control MERS-CoV infections. In this study, a bacterium (Lactococcus lactis)-like particle (BLP) vaccine displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) was developed, and gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles were used as substrates to externally bind to the MERS-CoV RBD through a protein anchor (PA). The designs included different numbers of lysin motif (LysM) repeats in the PAs linked by linkers (RBD-linker-PA2 (RLP(2)), RBD-linker-PA3 (RLP(3)) and RBD-PA3 (RP(3))), and three LysM repeats and a linker in the fusion proteins increased the binding activity to the RBD. The specific immune responses were tested by intranasally immunizing mice with RLP(3)-GEM with or without the adjuvant GEL01. The results showed that GEL01-adjuvanted RLP(3)-GEM increased the systemic humoral, cellular and local mucosal immune responses in the mouse model, especially in the intestinal tract. The above results indicate that the MERS-CoV BLP product has the potential to be developed into a promising mucosal candidate vaccine to protect against MERS-CoV infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
