METHODS: This study enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with steroid‐induced necrosis of the femoral head. Patients had various stages of femoral head necrosis. The differential expression of serum proteins and mRNA from patients with steroid‐induced necrosis of the femoral head (SINFH) and healthy volunteers was analyzed by western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QT‐PCR). The pathological change in osteocyte necrosis was indicated by hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin stain showed histopathology changes in the necrotic area of patients with steroid‐induced INFH: bone trabeculae were fewer and thinner, became broken, fragmented and structurally disordered; intraosseous adipose cells became enlarged; the arrangement of the osteoblasts became irregular; and vacant bone lacunae increased. QT‐PCR showed significantly lower levels of α‐2‐macroglobulin in the serum of patients with SINFH than in controls (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting demonstrated that the expression of α‐2‐macroglobulin was significantly decreased in the necrotic area of SINFH patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The α‐2‐macroglobulin may be associated with the pathology of SINFH. The multiple pathological reactions occur in SINFH and α‐2‐macroglobulin may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of SINFH or a promising therapeutic target.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
