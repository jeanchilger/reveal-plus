Houttuynia eye drops (HED) is used for the treatment of VKC. However, the clinical evidence of HED has not been well concluded. Herein, we described a proposed systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical efficacy of HED for the treatment of VKC. METHODS: Six electronic databases (Medline, Embase, the Cochrane database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, and Chinese Biology and Medicine database) will be searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which evaluating the clinical efficacy of HED for the treatment of VKC. Studies meet the eligibility criteria will be included. Data of the included studies will be extracted and the quality will also be evaluated. Data synthesis will be performed using RevMan software. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias will also be investigated. RESULTS: This study will provide high-quality systemic review and synthesis of RCTs on efficacy of HED for the treatment of VKC. CONCLUSION: This systemic review and meta-analysis will conclude the efficacy of HED for the treatment of VKC. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42019124737&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
