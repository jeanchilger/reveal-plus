OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the gaps, challenges, and priorities for preventing the emerging and re-emerging infections, with a focus on biosafety and biosecurity in four countries of the region, namely, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Morocco. METHODS: A total of two different methods were used to determine the gaps and priorities for preventing the emerging and re-emerging infections. The first method was a rapid assessment for the preparedness and response to the emerging and re-emerging infections in four countries of the region, with a focus on biosafety and biosecurity. The second method was a face-to-face round table meeting of the participating teams for two days, where the teams from all countries presented their countries’ profiles, findings, priorities, and gaps based on the countries’ assessments. RESULTS: The assessment and meeting resulted in several priorities and recommendations for each of the countries in the areas of legislation and coordination, biosafety and biosecurity, surveillance and human resources, case management and response, infection control and prevention, and risk communication and laboratory capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Many recommendations were relatively consistent throughout, including improving communication or building collaborations to improve the overall health of the country.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
