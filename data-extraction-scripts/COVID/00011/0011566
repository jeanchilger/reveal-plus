This study reveals that cellular stress leads to the incorporation of the adaptor protein SINTBAD (TBKBP1) into membraneless, cytosolic speckles. Determination of the interactome identified >100 proteins forming constitutive and stress-inducible members of an MLO that we termed SINT-speckles. SINT-speckles partially colocalize with activated TBK1, and deletion of SINTBAD and the SINT-speckle component AZI2 leads to impaired TBK1 phosphorylation. Dynamic formation of SINT-speckles is positively controlled by the acetyltransferase KAT2A (GCN5) and antagonized by heat shock protein-mediated chaperone activity. SINT-speckle formation is also inhibited by the autophagy-initiating kinases ULK1/2, and knockdown of these kinases prevented focal TBK1 phosphorylation in a pathway-specific manner. The phlebovirus-encoded non-structural protein S enhances ULK1-mediated TBK1 phosphorylation and shows a stress-induced translocation to SINT-speckles, raising the possibility that viruses can also target this signaling hub to manipulate host cell functions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
