Sixty-three transplantations were performed in 60 patients. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 27 patients were diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, and in eight other hematological malignancies were diagnosed. Twenty-three were in first complete remission (CR), 20 in second CR, 20 beyond second CR. Four patients developed graft failure. Median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 14 (range 9–25) and 10 days (range 7–30), respectively. The probability of non-relapse mortality (NRM) by day +100 after transplantation was 10 ± 4%. With a median follow-up of 28 months, the probability of relapse was 32 ± 6% and disease-free survival was 52 ± 6%. Immune reconstitution was leaded by NK cells. As such, a high CD56(dim/)CD56(bright) NK cell ratio early after transplantation was associated with better disease-free survival (DFS) (≥3.5; 77 ± 8% vs. <3.5; 28 ± 5%; p = 0.001) due to lower relapse incidence (≥3.5; 15 ± 7% vs. <3.5; 37 ± 9%; p = 0.04). T-cell reconstitution was delayed and associated with severe infections after transplant. Viral reactivation/disease and presence of venooclusive disease of liver in the non-caucasian population had a significant impact on NRM. αβ(+) T-cell receptor/CD19(+) cell-depleted haploidentical transplant is associated with good outcomes especially in patients in early phase of disease. A rapid expansion of “mature” natural killer cells early after transplantation resulted on lower probability of relapse, suggesting a graft vs. leukemia effect independent from graft-vs.-host reactions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
