This review will evaluate studies that investigate how respiratory epithelial cells influence the behavior of immune cells and how epithelial cell/immune cell interactions contribute to antiviral responses and immunopathology outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Previous studies have characterized cytokine responses of virus-infected epithelial cells. More recent studies have carefully demonstrated the effects of these cytokines on cellular behaviors within the infected lung. Infected epithelial cells release exosomes that specifically regulate responses of monocytes and neighboring epithelial cells without promoting spread of virus. In contrast, rhinovirus-infected cells induce monocytes to upregulate expression of the viral receptor, promoting spread of the virus to alternate cell types. The precise alteration of PDL expression on infected epithelial cells has been shown to switch between inhibition and activation of antiviral responses. SUMMARY: These studies have more precisely defined the interactions between epithelial and immune cells during viral infections. This level of understanding is critical for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that promote effective antiviral responses or epithelial repair, or inhibit damaging inflammatory responses during severe respiratory viral infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
