This article provides a vision of integrated eco-friendly and sustainable behavioral communication change (BCC), biological control preparedness and resilience approaches, and innovations implementation in Saudi Arabia and GCC for the purpose of controlling the threat of Aedes-linked vector-borne viral diseases. Implementing innovative Aedes-linked arboviral preventive and resilient control measures is pivotal in improving community-based surveillance-response systems, BCC multidisciplinary and empowerment methods, and in enhancing community social mobilization and risk communication strategies. Moreover, boosting social, cultural and ecological preparedness, and prompt management approaches are necessary against the threat of local and global zoonotic epidemics and pandemics. Nurturing evidence and proven tick or mosquito vector populations' reduction, planned urbanization, climate change and waste management systems, and implementing data sharing and tailored mitigation solutions are crucial against the persisting Aedes competence and the public health threat of dengue, MERS-CoV, and influenza outbreaks. Sustained investment and ample financial allocation are needed to improve Muslim pilgrimage (Hajj and Umrah mass gathering) including point of entry screening and treatment, community-based education and awareness campaigns, and increasing mosquito vector viral pathogens surveillance interventions. Increasing evidence-based population participation and resilient emergency community preparedness and rapid response programs integration are critical to reduce mosquito breeding sites, dengue, and other arboviral infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
