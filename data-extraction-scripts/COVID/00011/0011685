Here, we report a case of acute transverse myelitis in a 13- year-old boy secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. He presented with left facial palsy and contralateral upper extremity weakness without sensory or autonomic changes. The patient was diagnosed with transverse myelitis based on his magnetic resonance imaging findings, although his presentation was mainly motor dysfunction, which is more consistent with acute flaccid paralysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
