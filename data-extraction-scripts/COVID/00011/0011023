Attendees included predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, junior investigators, clinicians, industry professionals, and established leaders in mammalian genetics and genomics. From November 11–14, major scientific advances in the fields of systems genetics, developmental biology, cancer, human disease modeling, and bioinformatics were showcased in a series of 66 poster and 54 platform presentations. Here we provide an overview of the meeting’s proceedings and summarize the exciting, novel research findings communicated by conference participants that, collectively, are advancing the frontiers of mammalian genetics and genomics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
