Our aim was to examine differences in physiological response in rat colonies bred and housed in a conventional versus SPF facility, and implications for research. Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and catheterized for blood and pressure monitoring, and electrocardiogram (ECG) leads implanted. Hematology was assessed, and coagulation profile using rotational thromboelastometry. Health screening was outsourced to Cerberus Sciences. SPF rats had significantly lower pulse pressure (38% decrease), arrhythmias and prolonged QTc (27% increase) compared to conventional rats. No arrhythmias were found in conventional rats. SPF rats had significantly higher white cell, monocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and were hyperfibrinolytic, indicated by EXTEM maximum lysis >15%. Independent assessment revealed similar pathogen exclusion between colonies, with the exception of Proteus in SPF animals. Returning to a conventional facility restored normal host physiology. We conclude that SPF animals displayed an abnormal hemodynamic, hematological and hemostatic phenotype in response to anesthesia and surgery, and provide a number of recommendations to help standardize research outcomes and translation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
