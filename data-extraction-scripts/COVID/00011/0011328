<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-05-29</DATELINE><TITLE>African Swine Fever Virus Armenia/07 Virulent Strain Controls Interferon Beta Production through the cGAS-STING Pathway</TITLE><BODY>African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a complex, cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus that is currently expanding throughout the world. Currently, circulating virulent genotype II Armenia/07-like viruses cause fatal disease in pigs and wild boar, whereas attenuated strains induce infections with various levels of chronic illness. Sensing cytosolic dsDNA, mainly by the key DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), leads to the synthesis of type I interferon and involves signaling through STING, TBK1, and IRF3. After phosphorylation, STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartment and to the perinuclear region, acting as an indispensable adaptor connecting the cytosolic detection of DNA to the TBK1-IRF3 signaling pathway. We demonstrate here that attenuated NH/P68, but not virulent Armenia/07, activates the cGAS-STING-IRF3 cascade very early during infection, inducing STING phosphorylation and trafficking through a mechanism involving cGAMP. Both TBK1 and IRF3 are subsequently activated and, in response to this, a high level of beta interferon (IFN-β) was produced during NH/P68 infection; in contrast, Armenia/07 infection generated IFN-β levels below those of uninfected cells. Our results show that virulent Armenia/07 ASFV controls the cGAS-STING pathway, but these mechanisms are not at play when porcine macrophages are infected with attenuated NH/P68 ASFV. These findings show for the first time the involvement of the cGAS-STING-IRF3 route in ASFV infection, where IFN-β production or inhibition was found after infection by attenuated or virulent ASFV strains, respectively, thus reinforcing the idea that ASFV virulence versus attenuation may be a phenomenon grounded in ASFV-mediated innate immune modulation where the cGAS-STING pathway might play an important role. IMPORTANCE African swine fever, a devastating disease for domestic pigs and wild boar, is currently spreading in Europe, Russia, and China, becoming a global threat with huge economic and ecological consequences. One interesting aspect of ASFV biology is the molecular mechanism leading to high virulence of some strains compared to more attenuated strains, which produce subclinical infections. In this work, we show that the presently circulating virulent Armenia/07 virus blocks the synthesis of IFN-β, a key mediator between the innate and adaptive immune response. Armenia/07 inhibits the cGAS-STING pathway by impairing STING activation during infection. In contrast, the cGAS-STING pathway is efficiently activated during NH/P68 attenuated strain infection, leading to the production of large amounts of IFN-β. Our results show for the first time the relationship between the cGAS-STING pathway and ASFV virulence, contributing to uncover the molecular mechanisms of ASFV virulence and to the rational development of ASFV vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
