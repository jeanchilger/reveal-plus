The aim of this study was to investigate these viruses in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). A retrospective study was conducted with 251 patients, from April 2009 to November 2010, using nasopharyngeal aspirates, naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples from hospitalized patients (children < 12 years and adults) who had SARI within 7 days of the onset of symptoms, including fever (> 38.8 °C), dyspnea, and cough. Clinical and epidemiological information was obtained through standardized questionnaire. Enrolled patients were initially suspected to have influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infections. WUPyV and KIPyV were detected by real-time PCR. Samples were also tested for influenza A and B viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses. WUPyV and KIPyV were detected in 6.77% (4.78% and 1.99%, respectively) of hospitalized patients with SARI. All samples from children showed coinfections (rhinovirus was the most commonly detected). Six adults had polyomavirus infection and four (1.6%) had monoinfection. Of them, 3 reported comorbidities including immunosuppression and 1 patient had worse outcome, requiring ICU admission. These preliminary data may suggest a possible role of polyomaviruses in SARI among immunocompromised adult patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
