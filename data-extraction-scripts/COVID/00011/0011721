This review summarizes recent progress in understanding mechanisms of –1 frameshifting in several viral genes, including IBV 1a/1b, HIV‐1 gag‐pol, and SFV 6K, and in Escherichia coli dnaX. The exact frameshifting route depends on the availability of aminoacyl‐tRNAs: the ribosome normally slips into the –1‐frame during tRNA translocation, but can also frameshift during decoding at condition when aminoacyl‐tRNA is in limited supply. Different frameshifting routes and additional slippery sites allow viruses to maintain a constant production of their key proteins. The emerging idea that tRNA pools are important for frameshifting provides new direction for developing antiviral therapies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
