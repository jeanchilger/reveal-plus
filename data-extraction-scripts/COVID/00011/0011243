For RNA viruses, cellular or virus-encoded RNA helicases play pivotal roles in viral life cycles by remodelling viral RNA structures and/or unwinding viral dsRNA produced during replication. However, no helicase or helicase-like activity has ever been found to associate with any NNSV-encoded proteins, and it is unknown whether the replication of NNSVs requires the participation of any viral or cellular helicase. Here, we show that despite of containing no conserved NTPase/helicase motifs, EBOV VP35 possesses the NTPase and helicase-like activities that can hydrolyse all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helices in an NTP-dependent manner, respectively. Moreover, guanidine hydrochloride, an FDA-approved compound and inhibitor of certain viral helicases, inhibited the NTPase and helicase-like activities of VP35 as well as the replication/transcription of an EBOV minigenome replicon in cells, highlighting the importance of VP35 helicase-like activity during EBOV life cycle. Together, our findings provide the first demonstration of the NTPase/helicase-like activity encoded by EBOV, and would foster our understanding of EBOV and NNSVs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
