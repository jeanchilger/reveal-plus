<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-06-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Respiratory Syncytial Virus Seasonality, Beijing, China, 2007–2015</TITLE><BODY>During July 2007–June 2015, we enrolled 4,225 hospitalized children with pneumonia in a study to determine the seasonality of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Beijing, China. We defined season as the period during which >10% of total PCRs performed each week were RSV positive. We identified 8 distinctive RSV seasons. On average, the season onset occurred at week 41 (mid-October) and lasted 33 weeks, through week 20 of the next year (mid-May); 97% of all RSV-positive cases occurred during the season. RSV seasons occurred 3–5 weeks earlier and lasted ≈6 weeks longer in RSV subgroup A–dominant years than in RSV subgroup B–dominant years. Our analysis indicates that monitoring such RSV subgroup shifts might provide better estimates for the onset of RSV transmission. PCR-based tests could be a flexible or complementary way of determining RSV seasonality in locations where RSV surveillance is less well-established, such as local hospitals throughout China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
