Besides their capacity to neutralize viruses, antibodies also exert their antiviral effects by crystallizable fragment (Fc)-mediated effector mechanisms. This involves a bridge between innate and adaptive immune systems, wherein antibodies form immune complexes that drive numerous innate immune effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis, and antibody-dependent phagocytosis. Here, we review certain mechanisms that modulate these antibody-mediated effector functions against virally infected cells, such as viral glycoprotein shedding, viral glycoprotein internalization, antibody cooperativity, and antibody glycosylation. These mechanisms can either protect viral replication or enhance infected cell clearance. Here we discuss the importance of these understudied factors in modulating Fc-mediated effector functions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
