We evaluated the distinct and characteristic phases of CCP, by means of the optical microscopy of the nasal mucosa (nasal cytology), in 20 patients (12 males and 8 females; aged between 18 and 40 years). Three phases of CCP by nasal cytology are detected. This outcome confirms that CCP represents a sign of suffering nasal epithelial cell. (www.actabiomedica.it)&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
