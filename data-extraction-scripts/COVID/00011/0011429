The challengeable N(1)-functionalization of N-unsubstituted isatins into N-substituted (NS) isatins was realized through 10 mol % NHC and 10 mol % 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene catalysts within 10 min with up to 98% isolation yield. The subsequent MBH adducts of as-synthesized NS-isatins (N(1)/C(3)-functionalization) was perfectly acquired in 10 mol % NHC and 10 mol % 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane catalysis within 30 min with superiority to C(3)/N(1)-functionalization (MBH/aza-Michael). For guiding the application to a versatile druggable isatin library, the NHC catalysis was compared with reported functionalization of isatins in view of green chemistry principles including solvent scoring of ACS GCI pharmaceutical roundtable, E-factor, atom economy, and so on.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
