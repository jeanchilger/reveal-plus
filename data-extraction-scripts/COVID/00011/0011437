Established methods in biomolecule structure determination typically require purification, crystallization, or modification of target molecules, which limits their applications for analyzing trace amounts of biomolecules in complex matrices. Here, we developed instruments and methods of mobility capillary electrophoresis (MCE) and its coupling with MS for the 3D structural analysis of biomolecules in the liquid phase. Biomolecules in complex matrices could be separated by MCE and sequentially detected by MS. The effective radius and the aspect ratio of each separated biomolecule were simultaneously determined through the separation by MCE, which were then used as restraints in determining biomolecule conformations through modeling. Feasibility of this method was verified by analyzing a mixture of somatostatin and bradykinin, two peptides with known liquid-phase structures. Proteins could also be structurally analyzed using this method, which was demonstrated for lysozyme. The combination of MCE and MS for complex sample analysis was also demonstrated. MCE and MCE–MS would allow us to analyze trace amounts of biomolecules in complex matrices, which has the potential to be an alternative and powerful biomolecule structure analysis technique.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
