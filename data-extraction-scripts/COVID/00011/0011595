RESULTS: Here, we describe a case of emerging calf diarrhoea on a cattle farm in Henan Province, Central China. BNoV was the only enteric pathogen detected in outbreaks according to tests for enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites. The complete genome of the newly identified strain CH-HNSC-2018 was successfully sequenced and found to be 7342 nucleotides in length. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that CH-HNSC-2018 belongs to GIII.2 BNoV. Further analysis of the major capsid protein demonstrated that it is separated by specific genetic distances from previous BNoV strains identified in China and has 4 new amino acid (aa) mutations, 134A, 327 T, 380 L and 423A, in the VP1 protein and 11 aa substitutions in the hypervariable P2 subdomain, suggesting that the BNoV strains circulating in China are diverse. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first detection of GIII.2 BNoV in the VP1 region in China. This report should form a basis for further molecular studies on NoV and bovine enteric viruses in China.
