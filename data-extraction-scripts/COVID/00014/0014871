<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>Interfering with disease: a progress report on siRNA-based therapeutics</TITLE><BODY>RNA interference (RNAi) quietly crept into biological research in the 1990s when unexpected gene-silencing phenomena in plants and flatworms first perplexed scientists. Following the demonstration of RNAi in mammalian cells in 2001, it was quickly realized that this highly specific mechanism of sequence-specific gene silencing might be harnessed to develop a new class of drugs that interfere with disease-causing or disease-promoting genes. Here we discuss the considerations that go into developing RNAi-based therapeutics starting from in vitro lead design and identification, to in vivo pre-clinical drug delivery and testing. We conclude by reviewing the latest clinical experience with RNAi therapeutics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
