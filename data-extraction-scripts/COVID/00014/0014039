To investigate the genomic feature of H120 and further understand its role in the epidemiology of IBV, complete genome of H120 was sequenced and compared with sequences of other IBV strains by phylogenetic and recombination analysis. The complete genome of H120 is 27631 nucleotides in length and has a similar structure with that of Beaudette strain. We found that strain ZJ971 is probably a virulence revertant of H120. Nine amino acids changes and a three-nucleotide deletion were identified in ZJ971. Besides, potential recombination events associated with H120 were found in five IBV strains including H52, KQ6, SAIBK, Ark DPI 11, and Ark DPI 101. This study suggested that H120 might have contributed to the emergence of new IBV variants through both virulence reversion and recombination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
