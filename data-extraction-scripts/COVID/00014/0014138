Phylogenetic tree analysis based on the amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the S gene showed that the TGEV strains were divided into 3 clusters. TGEV TS showed a close evolutionary relationship to the American Miller cluster but had a 5′ non-translated region (NTR) sequence closely related to the American Purdue cluster. Continued culture in different cell types indicated that TGEV TS virulence could be attenuated after fifty passages in Porcine kidney (PK-15) cells, and that the Porcine kidney cell line IB-RS-2 (IBRS) was not suitable for culture of the TGEV strain TS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
