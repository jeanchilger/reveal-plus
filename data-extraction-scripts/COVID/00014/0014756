<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>Integrating epitope data into the emerging web of biomedical knowledge resources</TITLE><BODY>The recognition of immune epitopes is an important molecular mechanism of the vertebrate immune system to discriminate between self and non-self. Increasing amounts of data on immune epitopes are becoming available due to technological advances in epitope-mapping techniques and the availability of genomic information for pathogens. Organizing this data poses a challenge that is similar to the successful effort that was required to organize genomic data, which needed the establishment of centralized databases that complement the primary literature to make the data readily accessible and searchable by researchers. As described in this Innovation article, the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource aims to achieve the same for the more complex and context-dependent information on immune epitopes, and to integrate this data with existing and emerging knowledge resources.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
