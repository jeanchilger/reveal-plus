Hospitals in the Middle East currently reporting the disease are staffed by immigrants. In the current hot spots for MERS CoV a sizeable portion of the population is from other countries, but many of these countries have yet to detect any importation of MERS CoV. To assess the disease transmission in these countries, supplemental surveillance strategies are urgently needed beyond the currently recommended measures. A few strategies to address the situation are: (i) improving preparedness with enhanced surveillance in particular regions; (ii) targeting certain sentinel groups for surveillance in hot spots; and (iii) limited use of serosurveillance. Recovered, immune patients can be employed to give patient care during outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
