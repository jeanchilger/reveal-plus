<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1995</DATELINE><TITLE>Moloney leukemia virus-induced cell surface antigen mimicry by monoclonal antibodies</TITLE><BODY>We have investigated antigen-independent modulation of immune responses by monoclonal antibodies directed against both viral and nonviral antigens. BALB/c mice were immunized with monoclonal IgM (i.e. Ab1) specific for either Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced cell surface antigen (MCSA) or the hapten 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP). Injection with either Ab1 activated a functional idiotypic (Id) network as evidenced by production of both anti-Id (Ab2) antibodies and anti-anti-Id (Ab3) antibodies. A subset of induced Ab3 (designated Ab1), exhibited specificity for antigen (virus or DNP). In mice immunized with anti-Id antibodies (Ab2), production of Ab3 and Ab1′ was also observed. In the MCSA system, antibody-induced Ab1′ responses were effective in protecting mice from tumor development upon subsequent challenge with live virus. Furthermore, antigen-independent modulation of immunity to both viral and nonviral antigens was found to be thymus-dependent. Similar findings in other viral systems suggest that antibody-induced activation of Id networks may prove a viable alternative vaccine strategy that can elicit antigen-specific responses, and in some cases protection, in the apparent absence of exposure to antigen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
