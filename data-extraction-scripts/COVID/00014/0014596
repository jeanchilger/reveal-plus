Interaction between the fusion protein of RSV and RhoA, a small GTPase, facilitates virus-induced syncytium formation. We show here a RhoA-derived peptide inhibits RSV and syncytium formation induced by RSV and PIV-3, both in vitro by inhibition of cell-to-cell fusion and in vivo by reduction of peak titer by 2 log(10) in RSV-infected mice. These findings indicate that the interaction between these two paramyxovirus fusion proteins and RhoA is an important target for new antiviral strategies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
