To better assess the role of apoptosis in MHV infection, we used three different biologic phenotypes of MHV to examine their differential effect on the induction of apoptosis. MHV-A59 produces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, and chronic demyelination. MHV-2 causes only acute hepatitis and meningitis, whereas Penn98-1 produces acute hepatitis and meningoencephalitis without demyelination. We detected TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining in the livers and meninges of MHV-A59-, MHV-2-, and Penn98-1-infected mice. TUNEL staining in brain parenchyma was only detected in MHV-A59- and Penn98-1-infected mice. We detected apoptosis by electron-microscopy in olfactory neurons during acute infection with MHV-A59. The kinetics and distribution of TUNEL staining correlated with the pathologic damage and colocalized with viral antigen in some cells. At 1 month, TUNEL staining was found exclusively in areas of demyelination in the spinal cord of MHV-A59-infected mice; however, it was not found in nondemyelinated mice infected with MHV-2 or Penn98-1, or in mock-infected mice. TUNEL-positive cells were identified as macrophage/microglial cells, some astrocytes, and some oligodendrocytes, by colabeling with cell-specific markers. The presence of TUNEL staining in oligodendrocytes suggests that apoptosis may play an important role in MHV-induced demyelination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
