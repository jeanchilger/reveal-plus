The structures provide a foundation for understanding viral entry and the mechanism of action of compounds that block fusion. The first fusion inhibitor has recently entered the clinic, and the hope is that more potent and broadly active compounds, based on molecular design, will follow.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
