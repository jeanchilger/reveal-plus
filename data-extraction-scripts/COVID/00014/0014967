In addition, other classically non-enteric viruses (such as HIV and influenza) may also have enteric effects that are crucial in their pathogeneses. These effects can be due to direct infection of the gut mucosa, but can also be because of decreased antibacterial defenses, increased mucosal permeability, bacterial translocation, and systemic leak of endotoxin. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/mi.2008.79) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
