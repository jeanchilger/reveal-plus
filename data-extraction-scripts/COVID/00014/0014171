Several viral disease models in mice have been studied to understand the pathogenesis of demeylination. In particular, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) has been extensively studied as a relevant model. Various cytokines and chemokines are produced upon viral infection by different cell types, including antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages; dendritic cells (DCs); and glial cells, such as astrocytes, microglia, and oligoden-drocytes. The upregulation of the corresponding molecules are also found in MS and are likely to play an important role in the protection and/or pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease. In this review, the type of cells and molecules, gene-activation mechanisms as well as their potential roles in protection and pathogenesis will be discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
