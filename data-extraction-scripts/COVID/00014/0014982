Outbreaks of severe pneumonitis have been previously described in this setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study in children diagnosed with acute leukemia and a documented HPIV-3 infection in the context of a nosocomial outbreak occurred in a single center. RESULT: During summer 2012, an HPIV-3 infection was detected in six hospitalized children with acute leukemia. All the patients had respiratory symptoms and one of them suffered from parotitis. CONCLUSION: Early diagnoses using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) let us control this outbreak. A phylogenetic analysis confirmed person-to-person transmission of a single HPIV-3 variant.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
