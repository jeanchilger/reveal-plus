<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-09-11</DATELINE><TITLE>A neuropathic pain syndrome associated with hantavirus infection</TITLE><BODY>Hantaviruses are a group of single-stranded RNA viruses of the Bunyaviridae family. “New World” hantaviruses cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in North America. HCPS carries with it significant mortality and those patients who survive the disease are often left with substantial morbidity. Neurologic complications of hantavirus infections are rare, with only sparse cases of central nervous system involvement having been documented in the literature. To our knowledge, there are no reports of hantavirus infection contributing to peripheral nervous system dysfunction. Here we report a case of possible small fiber neuropathy associated with hantavirus infection, in a patient who survived HCPS. Persistent and treatment-resistant neuropathic pain may be a prominent feature in hantavirus-associated peripheral neuropathy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
