<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-11-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Global measles elimination</TITLE><BODY>Measles remains a leading vaccine-preventable cause of child mortality worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where almost half of the estimated 454,000 measles deaths in 2004 occurred. However, great progress in measles control has been made in resource-poor countries through accelerated measles-control efforts. The global elimination of measles has been debated since measles vaccines were first licensed in the 1960's, and this debate is likely to be renewed if polio virus is eradicated. This review discusses the pathogenesis of measles and the likelihood of the worldwide elimination of this disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
