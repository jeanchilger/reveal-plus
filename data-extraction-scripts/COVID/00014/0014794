<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>RNA viruses: hijacking the dynamic nucleolus</TITLE><BODY>The nucleolus is a dynamic subnuclear structure with roles in ribosome subunit biogenesis, mediation of cell-stress responses and regulation of cell growth. The proteome and structure of the nucleolus are constantly changing in response to metabolic conditions. RNA viruses interact with the nucleolus to usurp host-cell functions and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication. Investigating the interactions between RNA viruses and the nucleolus will facilitate the design of novel anti-viral therapies, such as recombinant vaccines and therapeutic molecular interventions, and also contribute to a more detailed understanding of the cell biology of the nucleolus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
