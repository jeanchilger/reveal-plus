<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004</DATELINE><TITLE>NALT- versus PEYER'S-patch-mediated mucosal immunity</TITLE><BODY>Recent studies indicate that the mechanism of nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) organogenesis is different from that of other lymphoid tissues. NALT has an important role in the induction of mucosal immune responses, including the generation of T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells, and IgA-committed B cells. Moreover, intranasal immunization can lead to the induction of antigen-specific protective immunity in both the mucosal and systemic immune compartments. Therefore, a greater understanding of the differences between NALT and other organized lymphoid tissues, such as Peyer's patches, should facilitate the development of nasal vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
