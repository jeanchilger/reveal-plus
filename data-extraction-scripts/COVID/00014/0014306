METHODS: One hundred nine pediatric patients having respiratory tract infections were included in this study. Real time PCR, DFA and cell culture method were used for detection of C. pneumoniae, RSV antigen and influenza virus respectively. Multiplex PCR was used for detection of other viruses. RESULTS: No C. pneumoniae DNA was detected in the samples. Virus was detected in 43 cases from larynx swabs (43/109, 39.4 %). The frequency order of the viral agents detected were as follows; rhinoviruses 14.7 %, RSV B 7.3 %, influenza A 6.4 %, metapneumovirus 3.6 %, adenovirus 3.6 %, coronavirus 0.9 %, parainfluenzavirus type 3, 0.9 %, parainfluenzavirus type 4, 0.9 % and RSV A 0.9 %. Sensitivity of the PCR and DFA methods for the diagnosis of RSV infections were detected as 100 % and 100 %, respectively. Specificity of the PCR and DFA methods for RSV infections were detected as 97 % and 100 % respectively. Sensitivity of the PCR and cell culture methods for influenzavirus infections were detected as 100 % and 100 %, respectively. Specificity of the PCR and DFA methods for RSV infections were detected as 96 % and 100 % respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of viral agents was detected as 39.4 %. Influenza viruses and RSV were common. Metapneumovirus was also frequent (3.6 %). C. pneumoniae was not found to be a common agent for acute respiratory disease in children.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
