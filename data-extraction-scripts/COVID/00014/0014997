We aimed to better define the situations where viral tests should be performed on BAL fluid (BALF). We retrospectively studied all cases where viral tests [immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, viral culture, and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)] were performed on BALF during a period of 1 year (2008) in our institution. We compared the characteristics of patients with virus-positive versus virus-negative BALF. Of the 636 BALF samples sent to the microbiology laboratory, 232 underwent viral tests. Of these, 70 (30 %) were positive and identified 85 viruses: herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 (n = 27), cytomegalovirus (CMV, n = 23), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV, n = 18), human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 (n = 12), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, n = 3), rhinovirus (n = 1), and adenovirus (n = 1). The variables associated with positive viral tests on univariate analysis were immunosuppression [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), corticosteroids >10 mg/day for ≥3 weeks, or other immunosuppressive therapy], ground-glass attenuations on computed tomography (CT) scanning, late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and durations of (i) hospital stay, (ii) intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and (iii) mechanical ventilation before BAL (p < 0.01 for each comparison). On multivariate analysis, only immunosuppression [odds ratio (OR) 6.4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [2.8–14.3], p < 0.0001] and ground-glass attenuations (OR 3.7, 95 % CI [1.8–7.7], p = 0.0004) remained associated with virus-positive BAL. None of the viral tests performed on BALF for the initial assessment of diffuse infiltrative lung disease (n = 15) was positive. PCR improved the diagnostic yield of viral tests on BALF by 50 %. Testing for viruses on BALF should be mostly restricted to immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory diseases and/or patients with unexplained ground-glass attenuations on CT scanning.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
