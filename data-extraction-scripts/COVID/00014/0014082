The molecules were designed from the structure of the known pseudo-mannobioside antagonist 1, by including additional hydrophobic groups, which were expected to engage lipophilic areas of DC-SIGN CRD. The results demonstrate that the synthesized compounds potently inhibit DC-SIGN-mediated adhesion to mannan coated plates. Additionally, in silico docking studies were performed to rationalize the results and to suggest further optimization.
