Human coronavirus sensitivity (HCVS) was expressed as a dominant phenotype in hybrids, indicating that mouse cells do not actively suppress 229E replication. HCVS segregated concordantly with the human chromosome 15 enzyme markers mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI) and the muscle form of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), and analysis of hybrids containing an X/15 translocation [t(X;15)(p11;q11)] localized HCVS to the q11 → qter region of chromosome 15. HCVS might code for a specific surface receptor, allowing 229E to be absorbed to and received within the host cell.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
