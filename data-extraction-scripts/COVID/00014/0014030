<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-01-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Current research status of immunology in the genomic era</TITLE><BODY>This review updates the current status of immunology research under the influence of genomics, both conceptually and technologically. It particularly highlights the advantages of employing the high-throughput and large-scale technology, the large genomic database, and bioinformatic power in the immunology research. The fast development in the fields of basic immunology, clinical immunology (tumor and infectious immunology) and vaccine designing is illustrated with respect to the successful usage of genomic strategy. We also speculate the future research directions of immunology in the era of genomics and post-genomics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
