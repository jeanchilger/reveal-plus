Restriction enzymes digestion and sequence analysis indicated the recombinant plasmid of pTRE-Tight-SARS-N contained the nucleocapsid gene with the optimized nucleotide sequence which will improve the translation efficiency. Positive cell clones were selected by cotransfecting pTRE-Tight-SARS-N with the linear marker pPUR to BHK-21 Tet-on cells in the presence of puromycin. A set of double-stable eukaryotic cell lines (BHK-Tet-SARS-N) with inducible control of the SARS-CoV neucleocapsid gene expression was identified by using SDS-PAGE and Western-blot analysis. The expression of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was tightly regulated by the varying concentration of doxcycline in the constructed double-stable cell line. The constructed BHK-Tet-SARS-N cell strains will facilitate the rescue of SARS-CoV in vitro and the further reverse genetic research of SARS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
