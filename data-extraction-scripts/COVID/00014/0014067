<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-06-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV): Update 2013</TITLE><BODY>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) came to attention as an emerging pathogen causing severe respiratory illness in patients from the Middle East in September 2012. As of 14 June 2013, 58 human cases of MERS CoV infection have been confirmed, including 33 deaths (case fatality rate of 57%). MERS CoV is a beta-coronavirus, in the same family as SARS-CoV, and shares a probable origin from bats. No animal reservoir or intermediates have been definitely implicated in transmission. Limited human-to-human transmission has occurred within several clusters, as individuals without a recent travel history have become infected after exposure to an ill returned traveler.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
