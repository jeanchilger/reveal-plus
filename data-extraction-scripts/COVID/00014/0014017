Among the four N-terminal antigenic sites A, B, C, and D, site A and to a lesser extent site D (S-AD) induce key neutralizing antibodies. Recently, we expressed S-AD (rS-AD) in recombinant form. In the current study, we used the rS-AD as an immobilized target to identify peptides from a phage-display library with application for diagnosis. Among the 9 phages selected that specifically bound to rS-AD, the phage bearing the peptide TLNMHLFPFHTG bound with the highest affinity and was subsequently used to develop a phage-based ELISA for TGEV. When compared with conventional antibody-based ELISA, phage-mediated ELISA was more sensitive; however, it did not perform better than semi-quantitative RT-PCR, though phage-mediated ELISA was quicker and easier to set up.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
