Tripartite motif-containing 22 (TRIM22), a TRIM family protein, has been identified as a crucial restriction factor that inhibits a group of human viruses. Currently, the role of cellular TRIM22 in PRRSV infection remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of TRIM22 on PRRSV replication in vitro and explored the underlying mechanism. Ectopic expression of TRIM22 impaired the viral replication, while TRIM22-RNAi favored the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells. Additionally, we observed that TRIM22 deletion SPRY domain or Nuclear localization signal (NLS) losses the ability to inhibit PRRSV replication. Finally, Co-IP analysis identified that TRIM22 interacts with PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein through the SPRY domain, while the NLS2 motif of N protein is involved in interaction with TRIM22. Although the concentration of PRRSV N protein was not altered in the presence of TRIM22, the abundance of N proteins from simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) diminished considerably with increasing TRIM22 expression. Together, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for TRIM22 and extend the antiviral effects of TRIM22 to arteriviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
