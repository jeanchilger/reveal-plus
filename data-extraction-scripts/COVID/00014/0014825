<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-08-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Discovery of modulators of HIV-1 infection from the human peptidome</TITLE><BODY>Almost all human proteins are subject to proteolytic degradation, which produces a broad range of peptides that have highly specific and sometimes unexpected functions. Peptide libraries that have been generated from human bodily fluids or tissues are a rich but mostly unexplored source of bioactive compounds that could be used to develop antimicrobial and immunomodulatory therapeutic agents. In this Innovation article, we describe the discovery, optimization and application of endogenous bioactive peptides from human-derived peptide libraries, with a particular focus on the isolation of endogenous inhibitors and promoters of HIV-1 infection. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nrmicro3312) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
