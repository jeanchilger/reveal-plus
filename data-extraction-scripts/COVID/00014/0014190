<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1991</DATELINE><TITLE>Secretory granule formation: The morphologist’s view</TITLE><BODY>A deeper understanding of the regulated exocytic pathway, and for that matter the constitutive exocytic pathway, will depend on our ability to characterize the proteins in the vesicle membranes. Characterizing the protein composition of secretory granule membrane has proven to be a formidable task, and as far as I know, the work done to date has not told us a great deal about the mechanisms involved in sorting the contents of regulated secretory granules, or bringing about constitutive or regulated fusion with the plasma membrane. Without knowing a great deal more about the membranes, there seems to be little prospect of real further progress in understanding the key properties of the regulated exocytic pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
