<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-12-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Influenza in the neonatal intensive care unit</TITLE><BODY>Influenza has historically been an uncommon illness in the newborn period, although epidemic outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units have been described. There is currently significant concern about the possibility of a new pandemic of influenza in the near future. During a pandemic neonates are likely to be exposed, with significant illness more likely in pre-term newborns due to reduced levels of passively transferred protective maternal antibodies. While newer therapies have been shown to be effective in reducing the severity of illness in adults and children, such therapies are untried in neonates. Supportive care and measures to contain and prevent spread of infection may well be the most important measures in the event of a neonate acquiring influenza, including the avian variety.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
