<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004</DATELINE><TITLE>A genomics-based approach to biodefence preparedness</TITLE><BODY>The anthrax letter attacks in October 2001, followed by the SARS outbreak in early 2003, dramatically illustrated our vulnerability to both deliberate and natural outbreaks of infectious disease. The availability of pathogen genome sequences and high-throughput methods for studying the biology of both pathogens and their hosts have provided new insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and host defence. As infectious disease research expands to include major bioterror agents, genomics-based approaches will provide one of the cornerstones of efforts to develop more accurate diagnostics, new therapeutics and vaccines, and further capabilities for microbial forensics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
