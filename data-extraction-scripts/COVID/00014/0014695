<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-12-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Models for facilitating access to patents on genetic inventions</TITLE><BODY>The genetics community is increasingly concerned that patents might lead to restricted access to research and health care. We explore various measures that are designed to render patented genetic inventions accessible to further use in research, and to diagnosis and/or treatment. They include the often-recited research or experimental-use exemption, conventional one-to-one licensing and compulsory licensing, as well as patent pools and clearing-house mechanisms. The last two alternatives deserve special attention in the area of human genetics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
