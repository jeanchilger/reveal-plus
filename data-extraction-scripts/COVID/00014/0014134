From a total of 74 lung tissue and 74 tracheal swab samples Staphylococcus aureus, 16.3%, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, 13.0%, and Pasteurella multocida, 10.9%, were dominant isolates from pneumonic lungs; Escherichia coli, 12.7%, Proteus species, 10.9%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9.1%, were the majority in the normal lungs. The majority of the isolates colonized both anatomical sites investigated. There was a statistically significant association between the health status of the camels as well as the anatomical site studied with the isolation rates of the major respiratory pathogens (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the isolates were susceptible to norfloxacin, streptomycin, and gentamicin but resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline on in vitro test. Further studies on the pathogenicity of the major isolates are recommended.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
