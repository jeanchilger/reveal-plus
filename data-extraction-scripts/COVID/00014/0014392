<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2002-10-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Gene Therapy Progress and Prospects: Cystic fibrosis</TITLE><BODY>Since the cloning of the cystic fibrosis gene (CFTR) in 1989, 18 clinical trials have been carried out, including five in the 2 years reviewed here. Most trials demonstrated proof-of-principle for gene transfer to the airway. However, gene transfer efficiency with each of the three gene transfer agents (adenovirus (Ad), adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) and cationic liposomes) was low, and most likely insufficient to achieve clinical benefit. Here, we will review the clinical and pre-clinical progress for the last 2 years (2000–2001) and briefly speculate on future prospects for the next 2 in CF gene therapy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
