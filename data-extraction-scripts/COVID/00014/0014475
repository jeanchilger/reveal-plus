Its role in the nervous system is prominent but paradoxical. Studies on uninflamed or “normal” brain have generally attributed TNF-α a neuromodulatory effect. In contrast, in inflamed or diseased brain, the abundance of evidence suggests that TNF-α has an overall neurotoxic effect, which may be particularly pronounced for virally mediated neurological disease. Still others have found TNF-α to be protective under some conditions of neurological insult. It is still uncertain exactly how TNF-α is able to induce these opposing effects through receptor activation of only a limited set of cell signaling pathways. In this paper, we provide support from the literature to advance our hypothesis that one mechanism by which TNF-α can exert its paradoxical effects in the brain is via crosstalk with signaling pathways of growth factors or other cytokines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
