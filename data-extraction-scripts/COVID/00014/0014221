<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-04-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Human monoclonal antibodies as candidate therapeutics against emerging viruses and HIV-1</TITLE><BODY>More than 40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been approved for a number of disease indications with only one of these (Synagis) — for a viral disease, and not for therapy but for prevention. However, in the last decade novel potent mAbs have been discovered and characterized with potential as therapeutics against viruses of major importance for public health and biosecurity including Hendra virus (HeV), Nipah virus (NiV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), West Nile virus (WNV), influenza virus (IFV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Here, we review such mAbs with an emphasis on antibodies of human origin, and highlight recent results as well as technologies and mechanisms related to their potential as therapeutics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
