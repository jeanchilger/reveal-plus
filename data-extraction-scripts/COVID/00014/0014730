Helicases, both viral and human, have recently emerged as novel targets for the treatment of viral infections. Here, we discuss the role of these enzymes, factors affecting their potential as drug targets and progress in the development of agents that inhibit their activity using the hepatitis C virus-encoded helicase NS3 and the cellular helicase DDX3 adopted for use by HIV-1 as examples.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
