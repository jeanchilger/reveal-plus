<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006</DATELINE><TITLE>Evaluation of a Commercially Available Human Serum Amyloid A (SAA) Turbidimetric Immunoassay for Determination of Feline SAA Concentration</TITLE><BODY>Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein in cats likely to be useful for diagnosing and monitoring inflammatory diseases, especially if rapid, reliable and automated assays can be made available. A commercially available automated human SAA turbidimetric immunoassay (SAA-TIA) was evaluated for determination of SAA in cats. Intra-assay and inter-assay imprecisions were in the ranges 2.1–9.9% and 7.0–12.5%, respectively, and without significant inaccuracy. Eighty-eight cats were divided into groups according to (A) the presence or absence of an acute-phase response (APR) (n = 23 and 65, respectively) and (B) clinical diagnosis (clinically healthy cats, cats diagnosed with inflammatory/infectious diseases, endocrine/metabolic diseases, neoplastic diseases, and miscellaneous disorders (n=43, 13, 8, 4 and 20, respectively)). The observed SAA concentrations were, as expected, different for (A) cats with and without an APR and (B) cats with inflammatory/infectious diseases compared to other diagnostic groups, except neoplastic diseases. In conclusion, the SAA concentration in cats could be measured reliably using the commercially available TIA designed for measuring human SAA, which should facilitate implementation of the parameter for routine diagnostic purposes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
