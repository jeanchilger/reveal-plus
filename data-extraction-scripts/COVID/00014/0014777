How can pathogen genotyping data best be translated to inform disease management and surveillance? Pathogen profiling integrates microbial genomics data into communicable disease control by consolidating phenotypic identity-based methods with DNA microarrays, proteomics, metabolomics and sequence-based typing. Sharing data on pathogen profiles should facilitate our understanding of transmission patterns and the dynamics of epidemics.
