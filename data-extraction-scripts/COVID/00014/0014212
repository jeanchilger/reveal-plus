Although virus-induced G0/G1 arrest often delays early apoptosis temporarily, a prolonged replication of the infected virus leads host cells to eventual death. In contrast, most mammalian cells with RNA virus persistent infection often escape cytolysis in the presence of productive viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated that the extended endurance of cyclin D1 was clearly associated with the suppression of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK-3ß) expression in BHK-21 cells that are persistently infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The G0/G1 arrest of these cells turned much loose compared to the normal BHK-21 cells with JEV acute infection. After cycloheximide treatment, cyclin D1 in the persistently infected cells lasted several hours longer than those in acutely infected cells. Furthermore, both p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1), positive regulators for cyclin D1 accumulation in the nucleus, were suppressed in their expression, which contrasts with those in JEV acute infection. Inhibition of the GSK-3ß by lithium chloride treatment rescued a significant number of cells from cytolysis in JEV acute infection, which coincided with the levels of cyclin D1 that escaped from proteolysis. Therefore, the limitation of G1/S arrest in the BHK-21 cells with JEV persistent infection is associated with the suppression of GSK-3ß expression, resulting in the extended duration of cyclin D1.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
