However, SARS-CoV M protein is co-localized almost entirely with S, E, or NC protein when co-expressed in the cells. On the other hand, only partial co-localization was observed when S and E, S and NC, or E and NC were co-expressed in the cells. Interactions between SARS-CoV M and other structural proteins but not interactions between S and E, S and NC, or E and NC were further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assay. These results indicate that SARS-CoV M protein, similar to the M proteins of other coronaviruses, plays a pivotal role in virus assembly. The cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of SARS-CoV M protein was responsible for binding to NC protein. Multiple regions of M protein interacted with E and S proteins. A model for the interactions between SARS-CoV M protein and other structural proteins is proposed. This study helps us better understand protein-protein interactions during viral assembly of SARS-CoV.
