This study was conducted on a farrow-to-finish farm that experienced a PED outbreak beginning on January 6, 2014. Blood samples were collected at weaning from 19 to 20 sows every month from July 2013 until July 2014 to investigate the ovarian condition. The mean progesterone concentration was numerically higher during January 2014 than the other months, but this difference was not significant. The mean estradiol-17β concentration was higher during January 2014 than during July and October 2013 (P < 0.05). In addition, reproductive performance was compared during January, February, and March before (2013) and after (2014) the PED outbreak. Sows that farrowed in January had higher preweaning mortality in 2014 than in 2013 (P < 0.05), but sows that farrowed in February and March had similar preweaning mortality in 2013 and 2014 (P > 0.10). Sows that farrowed between January and March 2014 had 15% lower farrowing rate than those that farrowed during the same months in 2013 (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our results demonstrate poorer reproductive performance of Berkshire sows after a PED outbreak compared with before the outbreak.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
