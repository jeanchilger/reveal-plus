To determine if chemokine expression corresponds with the cellular infiltrate, chemokine protein and RNA levels from the brains of infected mice were quantified. RJHM-infected mice had lower T-cell (CXCL9, CXCL10), but higher macrophage-attracting (CCL2), chemokine proteins compared to RA59. RJHM also induced significantly higher CXCL2 (a neutrophil chemoattractant) mRNA compared to RA59. The neurovirulent spike gene chimera SJHM/RA59 induces high levels of T cells and macrophages in the brain compared to the attenuated SA59/RJHM chimera. Accordingly, SJHM/RA59 induced higher levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL2 protein compared to SA59/RJHM. Chemokine mRNA patterns were in general agreement. Thus, chemokine patterns correspond with the cellular infiltrate, and the spike protein influences levels of macrophage, but not T-cell, chemokines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
