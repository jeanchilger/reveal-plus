To investigate if mRNA secondary structure improves stability of the complex, we tested a pseudoknot, originating from the genomic RNA of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the positive-stranded coronavirus group. We used the previously-isolated anti-DNA scFv, 3D8, as a target protein. During in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, we observed that incorporation of the pseudoknot into the mRNA resulted in production of a translational intermediate that corresponded to the expected size for ribosomal arrest at the pseudoknot. Complexes containing the mRNA pseudoknot exhibited a higher efficiency of affinity selection than that those without, indicating that the pseudoknot improves stability of the mRNA-ribosome-antibody complex in a eukaryotic translation system. Thus, in order to improve the efficiency of selection, this relatively short pseudoknot sequence could be incorporated into ribosome display.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
