Numerous preclinical and recent clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of RNAi triggers such as synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA). Chemical modification and delivery technologies can be utilized to avoid immune stimulation and improve the bioactivity and pharmacokinetics. Local application to the respiratory epithelia allows direct access to the site of respiratory pathogens that include influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This review outlines the essential steps required for the clinical translation of RNAi-based respiratory therapies including disease and RNA target selection, siRNA design, respiratory barriers, and delivery solutions. Attention is given to antiviral therapies and preclinical evaluation with focus on the current status of anti-RSV clinical trials.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
