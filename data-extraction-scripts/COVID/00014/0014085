<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-03-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Three clusters of bovine kobuvirus isolated in Korea, 2008–2010</TITLE><BODY>Fecal samples (n = 107) were collected from cattle with ascertained or suspected diarrheal disease on Korean farms during 2008–2010. Of these, 37 samples tested positive for bovine kobuvirus. The 37 positive samples came from 32 cattle that exhibited diarrhea and five cattle that were non-diarrhetic. The majority of the virus-positive feces samples were from calves under 1 month of age (n = 25). Nine of the 37 cattle infected with bovine kobuvirus were confirmed to have a co-infection with other viruses including bovine rotavirus (n = 3), bovine coronavirus (n = 1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (n = 1), and both bovine coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhea virus (n = 4). A neighbor-joining tree grouped 36 of the Korean kobuvirus strains (with the exception of the KB8 strain) into three clusters (G1, G3, and G4), while strains derived from Thailand and Japan (except the U1 strain) were included in the G2 cluster. The results indicated that Korean bovine kobuvirus has diverse lineages regardless of disease status and species.
