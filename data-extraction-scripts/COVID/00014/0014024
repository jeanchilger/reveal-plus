However, ZZ2004, a Chinese isolate of IBV, was obtained from ducks with clinical growth suppression and mild respiratory symptoms that had been reared with chickens in the central region of China. Virus isolation, virus neutralization testing, and RT-PCR were employed to identify the causative pathogen, while sequence alignment was used to analyze gene variations of the S1 subunit and M genes. The results showed that the ducks were infected with IBV due to the emergence of a dwarfing phenotype and the death of embryos between 48 and 144 h post-inoculation. RT-PCR also confirmed the presence of the expected fragment sizes of the S1 subunit and M genes by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the results of the virus neutralization test indicated that the strains of JX/99/01, GD, SAIBK, LDT3 showed cross-reactivity with the ZZ2004 isolate, and hardly any cross-neutralization of IBV ZZ2004 was observed with the strains of M41, H120, Gray, Holte, or Aust-T. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that there were large differences between ZZ2004 and other IBV reference strains on the S1 subunit. Meanwhile, homologies in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the M gene of IBV ZZ2004 were 86.9–92.0 % and 91.1–93.9 %, respectively, compared with 35 other IBV reference strains derived from different regions. This result revealed that there were conspicuous variations among the selected strains. Furthermore, the results showed that the prevalent strains of IBV in ducks had no antigen homology with the vaccine strains widely used in China except the LDT3-strain, making it urgent to explore and develop new IBV vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
