<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-09-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Neonates Investigated for Influenza-Like Illness During the Outbreak of Pandemic H1N1 2009: Trivial Infections But Major Triage Implications</TITLE><BODY>We report eight cases of neonates (from birth to 25 days) admitted to the neonatal service of a teaching hospital with influenza-like illness during the outbreak of pandemic H1N1 2009, and discuss their management and infection control issues. Empirical antibiotics were often promptly initiated and timely stopped when sepsis was ruled out. Also, there was no pandemic H1N1-09 but influenza A (H3N2, n = 1), parainfluenza (type 3, n = 3) and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 1) have been isolated. The infants recovered spontaneously without any antiviral therapy. There was no outbreak of the respiratory infections in the neonatal service during the admissions. Respiratory viral infections can occur in neonates although the clinical course may be milder and nonspecific. Emergency room and frontline staff must be vigilant of the non-specific clinical features of infections with respiratory viruses in the neonates so that prompt triage and isolation can be implemented to avoid outbreaks in the neonatal service.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
