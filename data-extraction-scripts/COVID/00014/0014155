<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1991</DATELINE><TITLE>What the granins tell us about the formation of secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells</TITLE><BODY>The biochemical properties of the granins, studied in vitro and in a perforated TGN system, support the concept that the Sciective aggregation of regulated secretory proteins, promoted by the specific lumenal milieu of the TGN, is a key step in their segregation from constitutive secretory proteins in this compartment. A recently identified membrane-associated form of the granins is likely to also be involved in this aggregation, as well as in the membrane envelopment of the aggregate during the formation of an immature secretory granule.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
