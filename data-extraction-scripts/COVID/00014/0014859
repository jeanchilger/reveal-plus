<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006</DATELINE><TITLE>Antiviral agents active against influenza A viruses</TITLE><BODY>The recent outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, its expanding geographic distribution and its ability to transfer to humans and cause severe infection have raised serious concerns about the measures available to control an avian or human pandemic of influenza A. In anticipation of such a pandemic, several preventive and therapeutic strategies have been proposed, including the stockpiling of antiviral drugs, in particular the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir (Tamiflu; Roche) and zanamivir (Relenza; GlaxoSmithKline). This article reviews agents that have been shown to have activity against influenza A viruses and discusses their therapeutic potential, and also describes emerging strategies for targeting these viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
