The IC(50) value of cimiside E on gastric cancer cells for 24 h was 14.58 µM. The mechanism of apoptosis was further elucidated through western blot, RT-PCR, morphology, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle arrest was induced by cimiside E in S phase at a lower concentration (30 µM) and G2/M phase at higher concentrations (60 and 90 µM). Cimiside E mediated apoptosis through the induction of the caspase cascade for both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. These findings suggest that cimiside E may be an effective chemopreventive agent against cancer.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
