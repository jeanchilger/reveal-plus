We evaluate this issue by including all consecutive allo-HCT recipients with molecularly-documented CARV infection during the first year after transplant. The study cohort was drawn from a prospective longitudinal survey of CARV in allo-HCT recipient having respiratory symptoms conducted from December 2013 to December 2018 at two Spanish transplant centers. Respiratory viruses in upper and/or lower respiratory specimens were tested using multiplex PCR panel assays. The study cohort comprised 233 allo-HCT recipients with 376 CARV infection episodes diagnosed during the first year after allo-HCT. Overall, 60% of CARV episodes occurred within the first 6 months (227 out of 376). Thirty patients (13%) had died at 3 months after CARV detection, of which 25 (83%) were recipients developing CARV within the first 6 months after transplant. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors for mortality: ATG used as part of conditioning regimen [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (C.I.) 1.21–6.4, p = 0.01], CARV lower respiratory tract disease (OR 3.4, 95% C.I. 1.4–8.4, p = 0.007), CARV infection within the first 6 months of transplant (OR 3.04, 95% C.I. 1.1–8.7, p = 0.03), and absolute lymphocyte count <0.2 × 109/L (OR 2.4, 95% C.I. 1–5.3, p = 0.04). Developing CARV infection within the first 6 months was associated with higher mortality. Our data supports that the timing of CARV development after allo-HCT could be of major interest.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
