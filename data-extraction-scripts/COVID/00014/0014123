<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003</DATELINE><TITLE>Cloning and Sequence Analysis of the Spike Gene of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Chinju99</TITLE><BODY>The spike (S) gene of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) Chinju99 which was previously isolated in Chinju, Korea was cloned and sequenced to aid in the development of genetically engineered vaccines and diagnostic reagents against PEDV. The nucleotide sequence encoding the entire S gene open reading frame (ORF) of Chinju99 was 4152 bases long encoding 1383 amino acids. It consisted of 1001 adenine (24.1%), 849 cytosine (20.4%), 877 guanine (21.1%) and 1425 thymine (34.3%) residues. The Chinju99 S ORF nucleotide sequence was 94.5% homologous with that of the Br1/87 and CV777 strains, respectively. The Chinju99 S protein had 92.8% amino acid identity with that of Br1/87 and CV777, respectively. The amino acid sequence contained 27 potential sites for asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation and there was a stretch of highly hydrophobic residues at position 1325–1350.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
