Although there have been reports studying the overall immunogenicity of S(SL), knowledge on the precise location of immunodominant determinants for S(SL) is still lacking. In this study, using a series of truncated expressed S(SL) fragments and S(SL) specific mouse sera, we identified two immunogenic determinants for S(SL). Importantly, one of the two regions seems to be located in a region not shared by known immunogenic determinants of the S(SARS). This finding will be of potential use in future monitoring of SL-CoV infection in bats and spillover animals and in development of more effective vaccine to cover broad protection against this new group of coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
