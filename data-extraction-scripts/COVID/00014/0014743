<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-07-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Modern clinical microbiology: new challenges and solutions</TITLE><BODY>In the twenty-first century, the clinical microbiology laboratory plays a central part in optimizing the management of infectious diseases and surveying local and global epidemiology. This pivotal role is made possible by the adoption of rational sampling, point-of-care tests, extended automation and new technologies, including mass spectrometry for colony identification, real-time genomics for isolate characterization, and versatile and permissive culture systems. When balanced with cost, these developments can improve the workflow and output of clinical microbiology laboratories and, by identifying and characterizing microbial pathogens, provide significant input to scientific discovery.
