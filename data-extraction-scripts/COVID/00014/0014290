METHODS: After taking history, clinical examination and appropriate investigations, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 600 infants and children with symptoms and signs of respiratory infections. Samples were examined by RT-PCR for hMPV. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of hMPV infection among studied patients was 8% (95% = 6.1–10.4). The rate was significantly higher among children aged 2–24 mo compared to other age groups (11.9% vs. 3.7% and 4.0% for 2–24, 25–60, 61–108 mo respectively). Also it was significantly higher among females than males (12.6% vs. 6.6%). Cough, wheezing, rhinorrhea, fever and chest wall retraction were the most frequent presentations (81.2%, 68.8%, 66.7%, 64.6% and 56.3%; respectively). Antibiotics, bronchodilators and oxygen administration were the most common treatments offered (60.4%, 31.2% and 27.1%; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: hMPV is an emerging cause of acute respiratory infection in Mansoura University Children Hospital (MUCH), and may have a significant clinical impact on infants and children and thus, must be considered in etiological diagnosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
