Using targeted recombination we previously demonstrated that the S gene of the highly neurovirulent MHV-4 conferred a dramatic increase in neurovirulence to the mildly neurovirulent MHV-A59. To identify the genetic determinants of neurovirulence within the MHV-4 spike, we generated isogenic recombinant viruses containing various MHV-4/MHV-A59 chimeric spike genes, and studied their phenotypes in vivo. The MHV-4/MHV-A59 chimeric spike genes consisted of either reciprocal exchanges between the S1 and S2 spike subunits, or smaller exchanges specifically in the hyper-variable region (HVR) of S1. The chimeric spike gene containing recombinants all exhibited efficient replication in vitro, yet many were severely attenuated for virulence in vivo. Furthermore, these attenuated recombinants exhibited decreased titers of infectious virus in the brain relative to the parental recombinant viruses containing the full-length MHV-4 or MHV-A59 spike genes. This is the first report that compares the neurovirulence and pathogenesis of isogenic viruses with defined alterations in the MHV spike protein. From these studies, it appears that the interactions of multiple regions of the MHV spike, including the HVR, act in concert to allow for efficient infection of and virulence in the murine central nervous system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
