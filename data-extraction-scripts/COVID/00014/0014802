<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-07-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Architecture of the SARS coronavirus prefusion spike</TITLE><BODY>The emergence in 2003 of a new coronavirus (CoV) responsible for the atypical pneumonia termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a stark reminder that hitherto unknown viruses have the potential to cross species barriers to become new human pathogens. Here we describe the SARS-CoV 'spike' structure determined by single-particle cryo-EM, along with the docked atomic structures of the receptor-binding domain and prefusion core. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nsmb1123) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
