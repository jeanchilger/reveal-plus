<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009</DATELINE><TITLE>Straight talk with...Ian Lipkin</TITLE><BODY>How do you sequence a virus that no one has identified before? With the right technology, it's not as difficult a task as it might seem, says Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. Lipkin has been working on the technology involved with viral discovery since the late 1980s, when he became the first researcher to identify a microbe using only molecular tools. He and the Center's team of about 50 researchers have identified close to 200 new viruses so far. Most recently, Lipkin and his colleague Thomas Briese identified a new hemorrhagic fever virus that killed several patients in southern Africa last year. Now, in addition to processing samples from around the world, Lipkin has been working to export his sequencing technology—and the expertise needed to use it—to the developing world. Erica Westly spoke with Lipkin about how the viral discovery techniques he uses could help prevent future viral disease outbreaks, from swine flu to the unknown.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
