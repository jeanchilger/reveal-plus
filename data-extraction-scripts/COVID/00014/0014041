In this study, 25/129 (19.4 %) domestic pig and 1/146 (0.7 %) wild boar fecal samples tested in South Korea were positive for PAstV. Positive samples were mainly from pigs under 6 weeks old. Bayesian inference (BI) tree analysis for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and capsid (ORF2) gene sequences, including Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, revealed a relatively geographically divergent lineage. The PAstVs of Hungary and America belong to lineage PAstV 4; those of Japan belong to PAstV 1; and those of Canada belong to PAstV 1, 2, 3, and 5, but not to 4. This study revealed that the PAstVs of Korea belong predominantly to lineage PAstV 4 and secondarily to PAstV 2. It was also observed that PAstV infections are widespread in South Korea regardless of the disease state in domestic pigs and in wild boars as well.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
