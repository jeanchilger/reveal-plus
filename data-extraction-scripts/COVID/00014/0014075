One of these, called ORF7a or ORF8, code for a protein, known as 7a, U122 or X4. We set out to determine the three-dimensional structure of the soluble ectodomain of this type-I transmembrane protein by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The fold of the protein is the first member of a further variation of the immunoglobulin like beta-sandwich fold. Because X4 does not reveal significant sequence homologies to proteins in the data bases, we carried out a structure based similarity search for proteins with known function. High structural similarity to Dl domains of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, and common features in amino acid sequence between X4 and ICAM-1, suggest X4 to possess binding activity for the [Formula: see text] integrin I domain of LFA-1. Further, based on this structure based prediction, potential functions of X4 in virus replication and pathogenesis are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
