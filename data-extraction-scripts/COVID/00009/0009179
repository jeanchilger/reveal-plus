<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-03-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Small-cell Lung Cancer Presenting as Fatal Pulmonary Hemorrhage</TITLE><BODY>Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a lung cancer histological subtype unusual in its favorable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Life-threatening manifestations at presentation are rarely reported and should be an important clinical concern. We report a case of a 63-year-old man presenting with rapid-onset refractory severe thrombocytopenia, development of massive hemoptysis, and death from respiratory failure. This case provides clinicians a reference for this unusual presentation and carries clinical implications for managing SCLC patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
