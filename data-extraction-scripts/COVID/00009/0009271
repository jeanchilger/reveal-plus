Immunocompromised hosts (ICH) with respiratory illnesses often undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This prospective study aimed to evaluate the yield and concordance of NP and BAL FARP testing when performed on the same patient concurrently. METHODS: From February to December 2016, 125 patients (100 ICH and 25 non-ICH) were enrolled. NP swabs and BAL samples were sent for FARP testing. RESULTS: The yield of the BAL FARP among ICH and non-ICH was 24% (24/100) and 8% (2/25), respectively. The yield of positive NP swabs in ICH was 27% (27/100) versus 4% (1/25) in non-ICH. The majority of patients (89%; 111/125) had concordant results between NP and BAL specimens. Of the 24 ICH patients who had a positive BAL FARP, the majority (79%) had the same pathogen detected from the NP swab. CONCLUSION: The FARP may be useful in the ICH. Given the high concordance, in patients whom a pathogen is identified on the NP FARP, a FARP performed on BAL will likely yield the same result. However, if the NP FARP is negative, performing the test on a BAL sample may have an incremental yield.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
