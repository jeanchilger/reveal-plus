Currently, live-attenuated IBV vaccines are used to control the disease. However, safety, attenuation and immunization outcomes of current vaccines are not guaranteed. Several studies indicate that attenuated IBV vaccine strains contribute to the emergence of variant viruses in the field due to mutations and recombination. Therefore, there is a need to develop a stable and safe IBV vaccine that will not create variant viruses. In this study, we generated recombinant Newcastle disease viruses (rNDVs) expressing the S1, S2 and S proteins of IBV using reverse genetics technology. Our results showed that the rNDV expressing the S protein of IBV provided better protection than the rNDV expressing S1 or S2 protein of IBV, indicating that the S protein is the best protective antigen of IBV. Immunization of 4-week-old SPF chickens with the rNDV expressing S protein elicited IBV-specific neutralizing antibodies and provided complete protection against virulent IBV and virulent NDV challenges. These results suggest that the rNDV expressing the S protein of IBV is a safe and effective bivalent vaccine candidate for both IBV and NDV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
