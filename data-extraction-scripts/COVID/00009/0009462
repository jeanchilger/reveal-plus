While such structures have been actively studied and replicated in the laboratory, it remains unclear whether they can be used for biomedical applications. Here we show a transparent photonic nanostructure inspired by the longtail glasswing (Chorinea faunus) butterfly and demonstrate its use in intraocular pressure (IOP) sensors in vivo. We exploit the phase separation between two immiscible polymers (poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene) to form nanostructured features on top of a Si(3)N(4) substrate. The membrane thus formed shows good angle-independent white light transmission, strong hydrophilicity and anti-biofouling properties that prevent adhesion of proteins, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells. We then developed a microscale implantable IOP sensor using our photonic membrane as an optomechanical sensing element. Finally, we performed in vivo testing on New Zealand white rabbits and show that our device reduces the mean IOP measurement variation compared to conventional rebound tonometry without signs of inflammation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
