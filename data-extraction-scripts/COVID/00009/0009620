Inspite of large scale morbidity, with long lasting polyarthralgia, so far no licensed vaccine or antiviral is available. CHIKV nsP2 protease is crucial for processing of viral nonstructural polypeptide precursor to release enzymes required for viral replication, thus making it a promising drug target. In this study, high cell density cultivation (HCDC) of Escherichia coli in batch process was carried out to produce rCHIKV nsP2pro in a cost-effective manner. The purified nsP2pro and fluorogenic peptide substrate have been adapted for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based high throughput screening (HTS) assay with Z’ value and CV of 0.67 ± 0.054 and <10% respectively. We used this cell free HTS system to screen panel of metal ions and its conjugate which revealed zinc acetate as a potential candidate, which was further found to inhibit CHIKV in Vero cells. Scale-up process has not been previously reported for any of the arboviral nonstructural enzymes. The successful scale-up method for viral protease together with a HTS assay could lead to the development of industrial level large-scale screening platform for identification of protease inhibitors against emerging and re-emerging viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
