A two-dimensional liquid chromatography ((2)D-LC) combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) method was firstly established to separate and identify chemical components in YPF. A total of 33 compounds were identified, including 15 constituents (flavonoids and saponins) in Astragali radix; seven constituents (sesquiterpenoids and polysaccharide) in Atractylodis rhizoma; and 11 constituents (chromone and coumarins) in Saposhnikoviae radix. The corresponding fragmentation pathway of typical substances was investigated. Then, seven active constituents (astragaloside, calycosin, formononetin, cimicifugoside, 4-O-beta-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, sec-O-glucosylhamaudol, and atractylenolide II) derived from three medicinal plants were chosen to further investigate the pharmacokinetic behavior of YPF formula using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry system. The method was sensitive, accurate and reliable. We also used the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from zero to infinity (AUC(0−∞)) as weighting factor to make an integrated pharmacokinetic curve. Results show that the constituents of Saposhnikoviae radix have the best absorption and pharmacokinetic behavior and may play important role in leading to the changes of overall therapeutic effects of YPF. Further study is needed to confirm the association between them.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
