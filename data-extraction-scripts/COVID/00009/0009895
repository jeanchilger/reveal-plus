In this study we engineered the frameshifting pseudoknot from the mouse mammary tumor virus to respond to a rationally designed small molecule naphthyridine carbamate tetramer (NCTn). We demonstrate that NCTn can stabilize the pseudoknot structure in mRNA and activate –1PRF both in vitro and in human cells. The results illustrate how NCTn-inducible –1PRF may serve as an important component of the synthetic biology toolbox for the precise control of gene expression using small synthetic molecules.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
