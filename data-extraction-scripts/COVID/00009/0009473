METHODS: The structured questionnaire was adapted from the World Health Organization’s survey. Data were collected between June 26 and July 14, 2017. RESULTS: Nurses showed scores on knowledge (17.6±2.5), perception (69.3±0.8), self-reported HH performance of non-self (86.0±11.0), self-reported performance of self (88.2±11.0), and attitude (50.5±5.5). HH performance rate of non-self was Y(1)=36.678+ 0.555X1 (HH performance rate of self) (adjusted R(2)=0.280, p<0.001). The regression model for performance was Y(4)=18.302+0.247X(41) (peception)+0.232X(42) (attitude)+0.875X(42) (role model); coefficients were significant statistically except attitude, and this model significant statistically (adjusted R(2)=0.191, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced HH education program would be developed and operated continuously. Perception, attitude, role model was found to be a significant predictors of HH performance of self. So these findings could be used in future HH promotion strategies for nurses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
