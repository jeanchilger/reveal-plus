The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying rosiglitazone-mediated neuroprotective effects and regulation of the balance between the inflammatory cascade and generation of endogenous spinal cord neurons by using a spinal cord-derived neural stem cell culture system as well as SD rat SCI model. Activation of PPAR-γ could promote neural stem cell proliferation and inhibit PKA expression and neuronal formation in vitro. In the SD rat SCI model, the rosiglitazone + forskolin group showed better locomotor recovery compared to the rosiglitazone and forskolin groups. MAP2 expression was higher in the rosiglitazone + forskolin group than in the rosiglitazone group, NF-κB expression was lower in the rosiglitazone + forskolin group than in the forskolin group, and NeuN expression was higher in the rosiglitazone + forskolin group than in the forskolin group. PPAR-γ activation likely inhibits NF-κB, thereby reducing the inflammatory cascade, and PKA activation likely promotes neuronal cell regeneration.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
