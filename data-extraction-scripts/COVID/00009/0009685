<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016</DATELINE><TITLE>Acute myocarditis associated with novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus</TITLE><BODY>The novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been identified as a cause of pneumonia; however, it has not been reported as a cause of acute myocarditis. A 60-year-old man presented with pneumonia and congestive heart failure. On the first day of admission, he was found to have an elevated troponin-I level and severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography. The serum creatinine level was found mildly elevated. Chest radiography revealed in the lower lung fields accentuated bronchovascular lung markings and multiple small patchy opacities. Laboratory tests were negative for viruses known to cause myocarditis. Sputum sample was positive for MERS-CoV. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance revealed evidence of acute myocarditis. The patient had all criteria specified by the International Consensus Group on CMR in Myocarditis that make a clinical suspicion for acute myocarditis. This was the first case that demonstrated that MERS-CoV may cause acute myocarditis and acute-onset heart failure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
