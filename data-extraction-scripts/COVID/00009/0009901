Total RNA was isolated from 89 biopsies (21 hyperplastic palatine tonsils, 25 adenoids, 16 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils and 27 chronic inflammatory palatine tonsils with histological prove of acute inflammation), reverse transcribed and subjected to PCR amplifying IL-8, Gro-alpha, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2, MCP-3, MCP-4 and RANTES. 2% agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a predominance of IL-8 in the chronic inflammatory palatine tonsil group compared to tonsillar hyperplasia. Furthermore, eotaxin-2 was strongly overexpressed in adenoid samples compared to chronic inflammatory specimens. Our data suggest that the majority of diseases related to adenoid formation are mediated via an eotaxin-2 expression, whereas chronic inflammatory tonsillitis is associated with IL-8 upregulation. These data imply that adenoids are related to a Th-2, and chronic inflammatory tonsillitis to a Th-1 based immune response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
