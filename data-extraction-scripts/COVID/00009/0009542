It contains evolutionary information and provides intuitive visualization. To further analyze the similarity of proteins, we extract a specific vector from the graphical representation curve. The vector is used to calculate the similarity distance between 2 protein sequences. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to 3 real data sets. The results are consistent with the known evolution fact and show that our method is effective in phylogenetic analysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
