However, clinical data regarding frequency and outcome are scarce. METHODS: We identified all paramyxovirus RTIDs in allogeneic HCT recipients diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction between 2010 and 2014. Baseline characteristics of patients, treatment, and outcome of each episode were analyzed; ie, moderate, severe, and very severe immunodeficiency (verySID) according to HCT ≤6 months, T- or B-cell depletion ≤3 months, graft-versus-host disease, neutropenia, lymphopenia, or hypo-gammaglobulinemia. RESULTS: One hundred three RTID episodes in 66 patients were identified (PIV 47% [48 of 103], RSV 32% [33 of 103], MPV 21% [22 of 103]). Episodes occurred in 85% (87 of 103) at >100 days post-HCT. Lower RTID accounted for 36% (37 of 103). Thirty-nine percent (40 of 103) of RTID episodes required hospitalization and more frequently affected patients with lower RTID. Six percent progressed from upper to lower RTID. Overall mortality was 6% and did not differ between paramyxoviruses. Sixty-one percent (63 of 103) of episodes occurred in patients with SID, and 20.2% (19 of 63) of episodes occurred in patients with verySID. Oral ribavirin plus intravenous immunoglobulin was administered in 38% (39 of 103) of RTIDs, preferably for RSV or MPV (P ≤ .001) and for SID patients (P = .001). Patients with verySID frequently progressed to lower RTID (P = .075), required intensive care unit transfer, and showed higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Paramyxovirus RTID remains a major concern in allogeneic HCT patients fulfilling SID and verySID, emphasizing that efficacious and safe antiviral treatments are urgently needed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
