The gene expression data set GSE10474 was downloaded and assessed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Principal component analysis, functional enrichment analysis and differential co-expression analysis of DEGs were performed. Furthermore, potential target drugs for key DEGs were assessed. A total of 209 DEGs, including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes were screened. A number of DEGs, including zinc finger and BTB domain containing 17 (ZBTB17), heat shock protein 90 kDa β, member 1 (HSP90B1) and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR α were identified. Furthermore, gene ontology terms including antigen processing and presentation, glycerophospholipid metabolism, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, thyroid hormone synthesis and pathways associated with diseases, such as asthma were identified. In addition, a differential co-expression network containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D4, putative and tubulin, γ complex associated protein 3 was constructed. Furthermore, a number of gene-drug interactions, including between HSP90B1 and adenosine-5′-diphosphate and radicicol, were identified. Therefore, DEGs, including ZBTB17 and HSP90B1, may be important in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. Furthermore, drugs including adenosine-5′-diphosphate may be novel drug candidates to treat patients with ALI.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
