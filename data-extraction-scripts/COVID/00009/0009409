Here, we implemented a synthetic strategy to stabilize NHR-helical trimers, with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 fusion protein as the initial focus. A set of trimeric scaffolds was realized in a synthetic gp41 NHR-derived peptide sequence by relying on the tractability of coiled-coil structures and an additional isopeptide bridge-tethering strategy. Among them, (N36M)(3) folded as a highly stable helical trimer and exhibited promising inhibitory activity against HIV-1 infection, exceptional resistance to proteolysis, and effective native ligand-binding capability. We anticipate that the trimeric coiled-coil recapitulation methodology described herein may have broader applicability to yield NHR trimers of other class I enveloped viruses and to prepare helical tertiary structure mimetics of certain natural protein–protein interactions for biomedical applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
