MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken among practicing DHPs in Saudi Arabia. A total of 202 DHPs participated in this study. Knowledge and attitude were assessed using self-administered and pretested questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered online through Survey Monkey(®) program by sending link to the registered E-mail. Descriptive statistics were performed on demographic data. Mean knowledge and mean attitude scores of DHPs were calculated. Mann–Whitney U-test and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to disclose the differences between study variables. Chi-square tests and Spearman's correlation tests were applied to find the associations between the variables. RESULTS: The study participants showed mean knowledge score of 12.26 ± 2.27 (based on 17 knowledge questions) and attitude score of 8.63 ± 1.68 (based on 10 attitude questions). The spearman's test showed the positive correlation between knowledge and attitude of DHPs about MERS (r = 0.093, P = 0.188). Knowledge gaps were reflected in questions related to the duration of infectivity (47.5%), treatment of MERS (39.6%), reservoir of MERS-CoV (38.1%), availability of vaccination against MERS-CoV (25.2%), the likelihood of infection (24.3%), and the type of MERS-CoV (23.3%). DHPs showed a positive attitude toward adherence to universal precautions given by CDC and WHO (0.94 ± 0.25), active participation infection control program (0.94 ± 0.24), and use of gowns, gloves, mask, and goggles while dealing with MERS-CoV patients (0.97 ± 0.17). Male DHPs showed significantly higher knowledge and positive attitude toward MERS-CoV infection compared to females. CONCLUSION: DHPs participated in this study showed good knowledge and positive attitude toward MERS. However, still few lacunae in the knowledge and attitudes toward MERS-CoV were found requiring extensive educational programs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
