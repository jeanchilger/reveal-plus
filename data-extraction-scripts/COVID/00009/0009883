Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine how PEDV infection influenced growth performance and repartitioning of amino acids and energy in nursery pigs. A total of 32 barrows and gilts, approximately 1 wk post-wean (BW = 8.46 ± 0.50 kg), and naïve for PEDV were obtained, weighed, and allotted based on sex and BW to one of two treatments: 1) Control, PEDV naïve and 2) PEDV-inoculated (PEDV) with eight pens of two pigs each per treatment. On day post-inoculation (dpi) 0, PEDV pigs were inoculated via intragastric gavage with PEDV isolate (USA/Iowa/18984/2013). Pig and feeder weights were recorded at dpi −7, 0, 5, and 20 in order to calculate ADG, ADFI, and G:F. Eight pigs per treatment were euthanized on dpi 5 and 20, and tissues and blood were collected. At dpi 5, all PEDV pigs were PCR positive for PEDV in feces. Overall, PEDV pigs tended (P < 0.10) to increase ADFI, which resulted in reduced (P < 0.05) feed efficiency. At dpi 5, PEDV pigs had reduced (P < 0.05) villus height and increased (P < 0.05) stem cell proliferation in the jejunum compared with Control pigs. Pigs inoculated with PEDV had increased (P < 0.05) serum haptoglobin and increased insulin-to-glucose ratios compared with Control pigs at dpi 5. Markers of muscle proteolysis were not different (P > 0.05) between treatments within dpi; however, at dpi 5, 20S proteasome activity was increased (P < 0.05) in longissimus dorsi of PEDV pigs compared with Control pigs. Liver and jejunum gluconeogenic enzyme activities were not different (P > 0.05) between treatments within dpi. Overall, PEDV-inoculated pigs did recover the absorptive capacity that was reduced during PEDV infection by increasing proliferation of intestinal stem cells. However, the energy and nutrients needed to recover the epithelium may be originating from available luminal nutrients instead of muscle proteolysis and gluconeogenesis. This study provides insight into the effects of an enteric coronavirus on postabsorptive metabolism in nursery pigs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
