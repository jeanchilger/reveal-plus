The nearly full-length S1 subunit of the spike gene phylogeny of selected strains, however, split up this grouping, suggesting potential recombination in the S1 gene. In order to clarify this, various bioinformatic analyses of the strains were carried out, which confirmed this supposition. Two patterns of recombination were found among the strains, one of which could also be identified in GenBank-deposited IBV sequences from the region. These findings demonstrate that IBV strains of different recombinant patterns occur simultaneously in the same geographic region and could circulate for an extended period of time, thus contributing to the knowledge on IBV evolution.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
