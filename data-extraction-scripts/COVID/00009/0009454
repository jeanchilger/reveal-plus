Consistent clinicopathological abnormalities in the 4 calves presented for clinical evaluation included hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, increased creatine phosphokinase activity, and proteinuria. Four calves ultimately were necropsied and all had histologic evidence of immune complex glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis in these calves was hypothesized to have resulted from the interaction of passively acquired antibodies at birth and active immunization at 7 and 28 days of age with a Salmonella Typhimurium core antigen vaccine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
