Similarly, changes in sex hormone levels upon puberty, pregnancy, and menopause/aging are associated with qualitative and quantitative differences in innate immunity. Immune cells express receptors for estrogens (ERα and ERβ), androgens (AR), and progesterone (PR), and experimental manipulation of sex hormone levels or receptors has revealed that sex hormone receptor activity often underlies sex differences in immune cell numbers and/or functional responses in the respiratory tract. While elegant studies have defined mechanistic roles for sex hormones and receptors in innate immune cells, much remains to be learned about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of ER, PR, and AR in myeloid cells and innate lymphocytes to promote the initiation and resolution of antiviral immunity in the lung. Here, we review the literature on sex differences and sex hormone regulation in innate immune cells in the lung in homeostasis and upon respiratory virus infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
