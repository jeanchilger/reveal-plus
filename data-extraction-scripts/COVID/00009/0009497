Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes pig diarrhea, with 100% mortality in piglets less than 2 weeks old. No investigation has yet been made of the small intestine of piglets that survived infection by TGEV. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the impact of TGEV infection on the small intestine of recovered pigs. RESULTS: Histological analyses showed that TGEV infection led to villi atrophy, and reduced villous height and crypt depth. The number of SIgA positive cells, CD3(+)T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) in jejunum decreased after TGEV infection in vivo. In contrast, microfold cell (M cell) numbers and cell proliferation increased in infected pigs. TGEV infection also significantly enhanced the mRNA expression levels of cytokine IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β. Additionally, lower gene copy numbers of Lactobacillus, and higher numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, were detected in mucosal scraping samples from TGEV-infected pigs. CONCLUSIONS: TGEV infection damages the small intestine, impairs immune functions, and increases pathogenic bacterial loading, all of which may facilitate secondary infections by other pathogens. These findings help quantify the impact of TGEV infection and clarify the pathogenic mechanisms underlying its effects in pigs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
