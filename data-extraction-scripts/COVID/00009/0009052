Among these proteins, the multifunctional viral protein γ34.5 crucially interferes with or disrupts several antiviral pathways at multiple levels. The current study shows that γ34.5 utilizes nucleolar protein NOP53 to facilitate the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2α for efficient viral translation. Our study shows that: (1) ectopic expression of NOP53 greatly increases the intracellular and extracellular viral yields of HSV-1 (wild strain F) in type I interferon-deficient Vero cells, and more subtly promotes viral replication of γ34.5 deletion mutant virus HSV-1/Δγ34.5. (2) NOP53 is migrated from nuclei in HSV-1/F infected cells, but is redistributed incompletely after infection by either HSV-1/Δγ34.5 or ICP4 deletion mutant virus HSV-1/d120 (replication inadequate). Ectopic expression of γ34.5, consequently, induces cytoplasmic translocation of NOP53 in response to HSV-1/Δγ34.5 infection. (3) Increase of NOP53, in two forms of transient transfection and in vitro expression, attenuates the phosphorylation level of eIF2α in HSV-1/F infected cells, but fails to affect eIF2α phosphorylation induced by HSV-1/Δγ34.5 infection. (4) Knockdown of NOP53, which impairs the specific interaction between γ34.5 and protein phosphatase PP1α, disrupts the ability of γ34.5 to maintain HSV-1 virulence. (5) NOP53 knockdown also significantly reduces tissue damage and decreases viral yield in livers of HSV-1 infected mice. Our findings expand the understanding of the underlying mechanism by which viral protein γ34.5 induces NOP53 redistribution; cytoplasmic NOP53 facilitates γ34.5 recruitment of PP1α to dephosphorylate eIF2α, for optimal viral replication. This paper also demonstrates that blocking the specific interaction between γ34.5 and PP1α would be a useful approach for the development of antiviral agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
