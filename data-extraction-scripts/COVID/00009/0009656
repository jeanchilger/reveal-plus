We evaluated colonic structural, microbiomic and functional changes in old female vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabeus) and how age-related leaky gut alters responses to Western diet. We additionally assessed serum bovine immunoglobulin therapy to lower MT burden. MT was increased in old monkeys despite comparable histological appearance of the ascending colon. Microbiome profiles from 16S sequencing did not show large differences by age grouping, but there was evidence for higher mucosal bacterial loads using qPCR. Innate immune responses were increased in old monkeys consistent with higher MT burdens. Western diet challenge led to elevations in glycemic and hepatic biochemistry values only in old monkeys, and immunoglobulin therapy was not effective in reducing MT markers or improving metabolic health. We interpret these findings to suggest that ageing may lead to lower control over colonization at the mucosal surface, and reduced clearance of pathogens resulting in MT and inflammation. Leaky gut in ageing, which is not readily rescued by innate immune support with immunoglobulin, primes the liver for negative consequences of high fat, high sugar diets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
