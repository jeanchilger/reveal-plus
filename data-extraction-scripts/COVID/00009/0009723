OBJECTIVES: The recovery of pulmonary functions, exercise capacity, and HRQoL in the survivors of ARDS due to 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 pneumonitis (H1N1‐ARDS) was evaluated in a tertiary teaching hospital in northern Taiwan between May 2010 and June 2011. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of spirometry, total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DL(CO)), and 6‐minute walk distance (6MWD) in the patients survived from H1N1‐ARDS were collected 1, 3, and 6 months post‐hospital discharge. HRQoL was evaluated with St. George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). RESULTS: Nine survivors of H1N1‐ARDS in the study period were included. All these patients received 2 months’ pulmonary rehabilitation program. Pulmonary functions and exercise capacity included TLC, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV (1)), DL(CO), and 6MWD improved from 1 to 3 months post‐hospital discharge. Only TLC had further significant improvement from 3 to 6 months. HRQoL represented as the total score of SGRQ had no significant improvement in the first 3 months but improved significantly from 3 to 6 months post‐discharge. CONCLUSION: The impaired pulmonary functions and exercise capacity in the survivors of H1N1‐ARDS improved soon at 3 months after hospital discharge. Their quality of life had keeping improved at 6 months even though there was no further improvement of their pulmonary functions and exercise capacity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
