Many different serotypes of IB virus (IBV) are recognized which cause different clinical manifestations. According to the antigenic differences, different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect. Massachusetts serotype induces the best cross-protection against other serotypes. Recently, the IBV QX strain has been detected in Iran. QX strain causes permanent damage to the oviduct if it occurs in the early life cycle and is a significant factor in layer and breeder chicken flocks. In this study, we compare the H120 and Ma5 vaccines’ protection against early challenge with the QX strain in commercial chicks. one-day-old commercial chicks were divided into six groups. Groups 1 and 2 were unvaccinated groups. Groups 3 and 5 were vaccinated with the H120 vaccine (eye drop) and groups 4 and 6 were vaccinated with Ma5 (eye drop) on the 6th day (5 days after vaccination). Groups 2, 3 and 4 challenged (oculonasal) with QX strain (10^(4) EID50). Ciliostasis test, histopathology, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR were done at 11 days-old of age. Results showed that neither H120 nor Ma5 could induce proper cross-protection against QX early challenge, but the viral load and adverse pathological records in vaccinated chicks were less than that in the non-vaccinated groups. It can be concluded that vaccination on the first day of the life of a chick offers not full protection against the IBV QX strain but reduced the viral load and pathological damages in vaccinated chickens. Applying other forms of vaccination and using different genotypes on one-day-old chicks are suggested.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
