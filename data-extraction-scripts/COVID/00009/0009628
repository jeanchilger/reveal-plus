Previous studies revealed that PEDV exhibits an obvious capacity for modulating interferon (IFN) signaling or expression. The newly discovered type III IFN, which plays a crucial role in antiviral immunity, has strong antiviral activity against PEDV proliferation in IPEC-J2 cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein on type III IFN-λ. We found that the N proteins of ten PEDV strains isolated between 2013 and 2017 from different local farms shared high nucleotide identities, while the N protein of the CV777 vaccine strain formed a monophyletic branch in the phylogenetic tree. The N protein of the epidemic strain could antagonize type III IFN, but not type I or type II IFN expression induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) in IPEC-J2 cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the inhibition of poly(I:C)- induced IFN-λ3 production by PEDV N protein was dependent on the blocking of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear translocation. These findings might help increase understanding of the pathogenesis of PEDV and its mechanisms for evading the host immune response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
