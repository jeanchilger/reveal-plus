We previously reported that allergen components from American cockroaches exhibit varying levels of pathogenicity. Sensitization to major American cockroach allergen, Per a 2, correlated with more severe clinical phenotypes among patients with allergic airway diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we examined whether oral plant vaccine-encoding full-length Per a 2 clone-996 or its hypoallergenic clone-372 could exert a prophylactic role in Per a 2-sensitized mice. The cDNAs coding Per a 2–996 and Per a 2–372 were inserted into TuMV vector and expressed in Chinese cabbage. Adult female BALB/c mice were fed with the cabbage extracts for 21 days and subsequently underwent two-step sensitization with recombinant Per a 2. RESULTS: Per a 2-specific IgE measured by in-house ELISA in the sera of Per a 2-372-treated groups were significantly lower than in the control groups after allergen challenge but not the Per a 2-996-treated group. Moreover, Per a 2–372 vaccine markedly decreased airway hyper-responsiveness and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs, as well as reduced mRNA expression of IL-4 and IL-13 in comparison with the control mice. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that oral administration of edible plant vaccine encoding Per a 2 hypo-allergen may be used as a prophylactic strategy against the development of cockroach allergy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
