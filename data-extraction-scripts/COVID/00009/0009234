Information was collected by Healthcare structures (HS) on paper forms and transferred to the central level by post or email. Completeness of data reporting was around 20% in 2009–10. From 2011, in two southern regions data were transmitted through short messages service using one telephone provider. We evaluated the system in 2014–15 to determine its performance before changing or expanding it. METHODS: We randomly selected 80 HS and interviewed their representatives face-to-face (42) or by telephone (38). We evaluated knowledge of surveillance activities and selected case definitions, number of SMS with erroneous or missing information among the last ten transferred SMS, proportion of weekly reports received in the last 4 weeks and of the last four health alerts notified within 48 h, as well as mobile phone network coverage. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of 80 interviewed HS representatives didn’t know their terms of reference, 83% were familiar with the malaria case definition and 32% with that of dengue. Ninety percent (37/41) of visited HS had five or more errors and 47% had missing data in the last ten SMS they transferred. The average time needed for weekly IDSR data compilation was 24 min in the Southern and 47 in the South-eastern region. Of 320 expected SMS 232 (73%) were received, 136 (43%) of them in time. Out of 38 alerts detected, four were notified on time. Nine percent (7/80) of HS had no telephone network with the current provider. CONCLUSIONS: SMS transfer has improved IDSR data completeness, but timeliness and data quality remain a problem. Healthcare staff needs training on guidelines and case definitions. From 2016, data are collected and managed electronically to reduce errors and improve the system’s performance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
