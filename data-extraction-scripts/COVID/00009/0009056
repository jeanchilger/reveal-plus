However, few reports have described a direct comparison between multiplex RT‐PCR assays for RV. The objective of this study was to perform a direct comparison of three multiplex RT‐PCR assays for the detection of respiratory viruses. METHODS: A total of 201 respiratory samples (161 nasopharyngeal swab samples and 40 sputum samples) were tested with three commercial RV assays: Seegene Anyplex II RV16 (AP), LG AdvanSure RV (AD), and Biosewoom Real‐Q RV (RQ). The additional tests for the discrepant results were conducted by repeat RV assay or monoplex PCR coupled direct sequencing. Data analysis using percent agreement, kappa, and prevalence‐adjusted and bias‐adjusted kappa (PABAK) values was performed for comparisons among the three RV assays. RESULTS: Of the 201 samples, AP, AD, and RQ detected 105 (52.2%), 99 (49.3%), and 95 (47.3%) positive cases respectively. The overall agreement, kappa, and PABAK values for the three assays ranged between 97%‐98%, 0.76‐0.86, and 0.93‐0.96 respectively. The performance of the three assays was very similar, with 94%‐100% agreement for all comparisons, each virus types. The additional testing of samples showed discrepant results demonstrating that AD assay had the highest rate of concordance with original results. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that all multiplex assay would be suitable for the detection of for respiratory viruses in clinical setting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
