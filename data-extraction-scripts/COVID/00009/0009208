Regulation of these proteins allows the cell to alter its behavior under different circumstances. A major mechanism of protein regulation is utilizing protein kinases and phosphatases; enzymes that catalyze the transfer of phosphates between substrates [1]. Proteins involved in phosphate signaling are well studied and include kinases and phosphatases that catalyze opposing reactions regulating both structure and function of the cell. Kinomics is the study of kinases, phosphatases and their targets, and has been used to study the functional changes in numerous diseases and infectious diseases with aims to delineate the cellular functions affected. Identifying the phosphate signaling pathways changed by certain diseases or infections can lead to novel therapeutic targets. However, a daunting 518 putative protein kinase genes have been identified [2], indicating that this protein family is very large and complex. Identifying which enzymes are specific to a particular disease can be a laborious task. In this review, we will provide information on large-scale systems biology methodologies that allow global screening of the kinome to more efficiently identify which kinase pathways are pertinent for further study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
