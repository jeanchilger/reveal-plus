Based on numerous immune regulatory functions of astrocytes, we evaluated the contribution of astrocyte IFN-α/β signaling toward protection against the nonlethal glia- and neuronotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59. Analysis of gene expression associated with IFN-α/β function, e.g., pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), revealed lower basal mRNA levels in brain-derived astrocytes than in microglia. Although astrocytes poorly induced Ifnβ mRNA following infection, they upregulated various mRNAs in the IFN-α/β pathway to a higher extent than microglia, supporting effective IFN-α/β responsiveness. Ablation of the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) in astrocytes using mGFAPcre IFNAR(fl/fl) mice resulted in severe encephalomyelitis and mortality, coincident with uncontrolled virus replication. Further, virus spread was not restricted to astrocytes but also affected microglia and neurons, despite increased and sustained Ifnα/β and ISG mRNA levels within the CNS. IFN-γ, a crucial mediator for MHV control, was not impaired in infected mGFAPcre IFNAR(fl/fl) mice despite reduced T cell CNS infiltration. Unexpectedly however, poor induction of IFN-γ-dependent major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression on microglia supported that defective IFN-γ signaling contributes to uncontrolled virus replication. A link between sustained elevated IFN-α/β and impaired responsiveness to IFN-γ supports the novel concept that temporally limited early IFN-α/β responses are critical for effective antiviral IFN-γ function. Overall, our results imply that IFN-α/β signaling in astrocytes is not only critical in limiting early CNS viral spread but also promotes protective antiviral IFN-γ function. IMPORTANCE An antiviral state established by IFN-α/β contains initial viral spread as adaptive immunity develops. While it is apparent that the CNS lacks professional IFN-α/β producers and that resident cells have distinct abilities to elicit innate IFN-α/β responses, protective interactions between inducer and responder cells require further investigation. Infection with a glia- and neuronotropic coronavirus demonstrates that astrocytes mount a delayed but more robust response to infection than microglia, despite their lower basal mRNA levels of IFN-α/β-inducing components. Lethal, uncontrolled viral dissemination following ablation of astrocyte IFN-α/β signaling revealed the importance of IFN-α/β responses in a single cell type for protection. Sustained global IFN-α/β expression associated with uncontrolled virus did not suffice to protect neurons and further impaired responsiveness to protective IFN-γ. The results support astrocytes as critical contributors to innate immunity and the concept that limited IFN-α/β responses are critical for effective subsequent antiviral IFN-γ function.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
