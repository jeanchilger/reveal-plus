<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-06-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Recent Advances Towards the Development of a Potent Antiviral Against the Hepatitis E Virus</TITLE><BODY>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the leading causes of acute viral hepatitis. It also causes acute liver failure and acute-on-chronic liver failure in many patients, such as those suffering from other infections/liver injuries or organ transplant/chemotherapy recipients. Despite widespread sporadic and epidemic incidents, there is no specific treatment against HEV, justifying an urgent need for developing a potent antiviral against it. This review summarizes the known antiviral candidates and provides an overview of the potential targets for the development of specific antivirals against HEV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
