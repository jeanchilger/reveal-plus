The challenges of overcrowded EDs and ill-managed patient flow and admission processes result in excessively long waits for patients. AIM: The objective of the present study was to analyze the patient flow system by assessing the arrival and waiting time distribution of patients in an Emergency out Patient Department (EOPD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This short cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the EOPD of a Tertiary level health care Institution in North India in the month of May, 2011. The data was obtained from 591 patients, who were present in the EOPD during the month of May, 2011. The waiting time, inter arrival time between two consecutive patients were calculated in addition to the daily census data (discharge rate, admission rate and transfer out rates etc.) of the emergency. RESULTS: Arrival time pattern of patients in the EOPD was highly stochastic with the peak arrival hours to be 9.00-12.00 h in which around 26.3% patients arrived in the EOPD. The primary waiting areas of patients included patients under observation (29.6%); waiting for routine diagnostic tests (16.4%) and waiting for discharge (14.6%). Around 71% patients were waiting due to reasons within emergency complex. CONCLUSION: The patient flow of the ED could only be addressed by multifaceted, multidisciplinary and hospital wide approach.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
