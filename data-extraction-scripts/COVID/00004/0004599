The powerful sequencing platforms are rapidly producing huge amounts of nucleotide sequence data which are compiled into huge databases. This sequence data can be retrieved, assembled, and analyzed for identification of microbial pathogens and diagnosis of diseases. In this article, we present a commentary on how the metagenomics incorporated with microarray and new sequencing techniques are helping microbial detection and characterization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
