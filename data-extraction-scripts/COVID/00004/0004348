Some, but not all, previous studies have reported that low interferon responses in patients with asthma increase the risk for virus-induced exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the relationship between lower airway inflammatory biomarkers, specifically interferon gene expression, and the severity or presence of an exacerbation in asthmatics experiencing a naturally occurring viral infection. METHODS: Sputum samples were analyzed from subjects in an asthma exacerbation study who experienced a confirmed viral infection. Subjects were monitored for daily symptoms, medication use, and peak expiratory flow rate until baseline. Sputum samples were assessed for cell counts and gene expression. RESULTS: IFN-γ expression was significantly greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.002). IFN-α1, IFN-β1, and IFN-γ mRNA levels correlated with the peak Asthma Index (r=0.58, p<0.001; r=0.57, p=0.001; and r=0.51, p=0.004, respectively). Additionally, IL-13, IL-10 and eosinophil major basic protein mRNA levels were greater in patients with asthma exacerbations compared to non-exacerbating patients (p=0.03, p=0.06, and p=0.02, respectively), and IL-13 mRNA correlated with the peak Asthma Index (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that asthma exacerbations are associated with increased rather than decreased expression of interferons early in the course of infection. These findings raise the possibility that excessive virus-induced interferon production during acute infections can contribute to airway inflammation and exacerbations of asthma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
