Research material included fresh spent bleaching earth (SBE(0)) and the same material after 3 years of storage at the constant temperature of 20 °C, without aeration and moistening (SBE(3)). Changes in the chemical composition of analysed waste material were observed during its ageing process point to a spontaneous bioconversion of fat substance towards formation and/or release of free saturated fatty acids C16:0 and C18:0 (14.3 g 100 g(−1) D.M.), triterpenes (8.48 g 100 g(−1) D.M.), cholesterol (3.29 g 100 g(−1) D.M.), small quantities of carbohydrates and esters (0.80 g 100 g(−1) D.M.). This process was accompanied by other changes in physicochemical parameters of the waste material, such as colour, odour and viscosity, decrease in fat content from 28.27 to 24.6 % and that of soluble forms of metals (Mo, Cu, Fe, Zn, Ni, Cr and Mn), ranging from 25 to 75 %, and an increase in pH, from 3.85 to 4.2. At the same time, changes in the microbial consortium were observed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
