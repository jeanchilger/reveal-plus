Cytokines play a role in immune response and also maintains the normal homeostatic environment of the central nervous system. IFN-γ is one of the key effector cytokines produced by NK and T cells that enhances microbicidal activity of macrophages and neutrophils. PURPOSE: As the association of IFNγ +874A/T gene polymorphism with stroke has not been investigated in Indian population, we wanted to evaluate the association of this polymorphism with ischemic stroke in a South Indian population. METHODS: We genotyped 171 ischemic stroke patients and 153 age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed a significant association of TT homozygote with ischemic stroke (OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.05-3.43, p=0.03), while AA (OR= 0.84, 95% CI=0.54–1.31, p=0.46) and AT(OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.51-1.26, p=0.34) genotypes were not significantly associated. A and T allele frequencies in stroke were 58.78% and 41.22% as against 65.36% and 34.64% in control group, respectively, thus, suggesting no statistically significant differences in the A (OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.54–1.03, p=0.08) and T (OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.96– 1.82, p=0.08) allele frequencies between the two groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the IFN-γ +874 TT genotype is associated with the increased risk of ischemic stroke.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
