We compared antiviral and IFNβ-stimulated gene (ISG) activities of IFNβ-1a sc NF with IFNβ-1a sc original formulation and IFNβ-1b sc. When equivalent unit amounts were compared, the IFNβ formulations demonstrated similar antiviral activity and induced similar levels of ISG mRNA. However, on a weight basis (ng/mL), significantly more IFNβ-1b sc was needed to equal the antiviral activity of either IFNβ-1a sc formulation, and both IFNβ-1a sc formulations induced significantly higher levels of ISG mRNA than IFNβ-1b sc.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
