The pathogenic mechanism of this novel reovirus is unknown. Reovirus pathogenicity has been associated with virus-induced apoptosis in cultured cells and in vivo. The reovirus outer capsid protein μ1 is recognized as the primary determinant of reovirus-induced apoptosis. Here, we investigated the apoptosis induced by BYD1, its outer capsid protein μ1, and its cell-attachment protein σ1 to understand the pathogenesis of BYD1. We also investigated BYD1 caused systemic complications in suckling mice. Under electron microscopy, BYD1-infected cells showed characteristics typical of apoptosis. Notably, ectopically expressed μ1 and σ1 induced similar pathological apoptosis, independent of BYD1 infection, in host cells in which they were expressed, which suggests that μ1 and σ1 are both apoptotic virulence factors. Consistent with previous reports of reovirus pathogenicity, suckling mice intracranially inoculated with BYD1 developed central nerve damage, myocarditis, and pneumonia. Collectively, our data suggest that BYD1 μ1- and σ1-induced apoptosis is involved in the multi-organ lesions in a suckling mouse BYD1 infection model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
