Anaphylactic hypersensitivity is characterized by an exacerbated response involving the production of regulatory cytokines responsible for stimulating the production of IgE antibodies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate an association of variants in cytokine genes (IL1A (−889), IL1B (−511, +3962), IL1R (1970), IL1RA (11100), IL4RA (+1902), IL12 (−1188), IFNG (+874), TGFB1 (codon 10, codon 25), TNFA (−308, −238), IL2 (−330, +166), IL4 (−1098, −590, −33), IL6 (−174, nt565), and IL10 (−1082, −819, −592)) between patients sensitive to dust mites and a control group. METHODS: A total of 254 patients were grouped as atopic and non-atopic according to sensitivity as evaluated by the Prick Test and to cytokine genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) method using the Cytokine Genotyping Kit. RESULTS: A comparison between individuals allergic to Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and Blomia tropicalis and a non-atopic control group showed significant differences between allele and genotype frequencies in the regulatory regions of cytokine genes, with important evidence for IL4 (−590) in T/C (10.2% vs. 43.1%, odd ratio [OR] = 0.15, p = 5.2 10(−8), pc = 0.0000011, and 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 0.07–0.32) and T/T genotypes (42.9% vs. 13.8%, OR = 4.69, p = 2.5 10(−6), pc = 0.000055, and 95%CI = 2.42–9.09). Other associations were observed in the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1A (−889) (T/T, C, and T) and IL2 (−330) (G/T and T/T) and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4RA (+1902) (A and G), IL4 (−590) (T/C, T/T, C, and T), and IL10 (−592) (A/A, C/A, A, and C). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes and hypersensitivity to dust mites.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
