METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed hMPV infections and underlying hematologic malignancy, solid tumors, solid organ transplant, rheumatologic disease, and/or receipt of chronic immunosuppressants. Data were analyzed using t tests and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Overall, 55 patients (median age: 5 years; range: 5 months–19 years) with hMPV infection documented between 2006 and 2010 were identified, including 24 (44%) with hematologic malignancy, 9 (16%) undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, 9 (16%) with solid tumors, and 8 (15%) with solid organ transplants. Three (5%) presented with fever alone, 35 (64%) presented with upper respiratory tract infections, and 16 (29%) presented with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Twelve (23%) patients required intensive care unit admission and/or supplemental oxygen ≥28% FiO(2). Those with severe disease were more likely to be neutropenic (P = .02), but otherwise did not differ by age (P = .27), hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient status (P = .19), or presence of lymphopenia (P = .09). Nine (16%) patients received treatment with ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, or both. Three children (5%) died of hMPV pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised pediatric patients with hMPV infection have high rates of LRTI and mortality. The benefits of treatment with ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin in this patient population require further evaluation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
