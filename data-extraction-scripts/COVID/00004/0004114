While an RNA stem-loop structure (the “HIV-1 Frameshift Stimulating Signal”, or HIV-1 FSS) controls the frameshift efficiency and has been hypothesized as an attractive therapeutic target, developing compounds that selectively bind this RNA and interfere with HIV-1 replication has proven challenging. Building on our prior discovery of a “hit” molecule able to bind this stem-loop, we now report the development of compounds displaying high affinity for the HIV-1 FSS. These compounds are able to enhance frameshifting more than 50% in a dual-luciferase assay in human embryonic kidney cells, and they strongly inhibit the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV-1 virions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
