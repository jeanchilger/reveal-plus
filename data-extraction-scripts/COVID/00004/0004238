METHODS: We tested 400 clinical stool samples from patients with acute gastroenteritis and compared the ICA results with the results obtained by using ELISA, enzyme-linked fluorescent assays (ELFA), PCR, and multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (mRT-PCR). To assess the analytical performance of the SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid kit, we determined its detection limit, reproducibility, cross-reactivity, and analytical reactivity for adenovirus subtypes, and performed interference studies. RESULTS: The overall agreement rates among the tested methods were 91.5% for rotavirus and 85.5% for adenovirus. On the basis of mRT-PCR, the overall agreement, positive agreement, and negative agreement rates of the ICA were 95.6%, 100%, and 94.9% for rotavirus, and 94.0%, 71.4%, and 94.8% for adenovirus, respectively. Using the ICA, we detected all the subtypes of adenovirus tested, but the analytical reactivities for adenovirus subtypes were different between the 4 adenovirus detection methods. The high reproducibility was confirmed, and no cross-reactivity or interference was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid kit showed acceptable analytical and clinical performances. However, interpretation of adenovirus positive/negative result should be cautious because of different detectability for adenovirus subtypes among adenovirus detection methods.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
