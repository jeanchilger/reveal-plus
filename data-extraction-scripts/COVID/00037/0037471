Cytostatic activity evaluation of the novel compounds showed that E-isomers exhibited, in general, better cytostatic activities than the corresponding Z-isomers. E-isomer 14 exhibited the best cytostatic effect against all evaluated malignant cell lines, particularly against hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2, IC50 =4.3μM). However, this compound was also cytotoxic to human normal fibroblasts (WI 38). Its Z-isomer 7 showed highly specific antiproliferative activity against Hep G2 (IC50 =18μM) and no cytotoxicity to WI 38. Moreover, compounds 3, 4 and 14 expressed some marginal inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
