One group of primers was designed to detect wild-type strains (i.e., strains with the gE gene) and the other group of primers was designed to detect both PRV gE-vaccine and wild-type strains (i.e., strains with the gG gene and with or without the gE gene). After amplification by Bst enzyme at a constant temperature of 65°C, a laddering of bright products was visible following electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. LAMP was 100–1000-fold more sensitive than the standard PCR. The assay was specific in that it did not amplify other porcine viruses including porcine parvovirus, porcine circovirus type 1, porcine circovirus type 2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, classical swine fever virus, swine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of its sensitivity, specificity, and simplicity, the LAMP assay could be a useful method for early and rapid differentiation of swine vaccinated with PRV gE-deleted vaccine from swine infected with wild virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
