Colostrum supplements (CS) have been developed to provide supplemental immunoglobulin when maternal colostrum is of poor quality. However, colostrum replacers (CR) that provide ≥100g of IgG have not been formulated. Our objective was to determine the absorption of IgG in newborn calves fed CS derived from bovine serum or CR derived from bovine immunoglobulin concentrate. The CS were prepared by collecting, processing, and spray drying bovine serum and blending with other ingredients to provide 45 to 50g of IgG per dose. The CR were prepared by further processing bovine serum to increase IgG concentration to >50% IgG and blending with other ingredients to provide 100 to 122g of IgG per dose. Holstein calves (n=160) were fed 90 to 244g of IgG from CS or CR in 1 or 2 feedings in two experiments. Blood was collected from each calf by jugular venipuncture at 0 and 24h of age and plasma IgG was determined by turbidimetric immunoassay. Apparent efficiency of IgG absorption was calculated. Plasma IgG concentrations at 24h of age were indicative of IgG intake and averaged 5.5 to 14.1g/L in calves fed CS and CR. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CS was 25 and 28% in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Mean apparent efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed CR ranged from 19 to 32% and were affected by method of processing and number of times fed. Treatment of plasma with polyethylene glycol reduced the efficiency of IgG absorption in experiment 1. The addition of animal fat to CR had no effect on IgG absorption. A second feeding of CR increased plasma IgG, but efficiency of absorption was reduced. Mean body weights at 60 d of age were not affected by treatment and ranged from 64.3 to 78.2kg. Plasma IgG concentration in calves fed ≥122g of IgG from Ig concentrate approached (9.9g/L) or exceeded 10g/L, indicating successful transfer of passive immunity. Provision of IgG to prevent failure of passive transfer is possible with CR containing >20% IgG when fed at 454g per dose.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
