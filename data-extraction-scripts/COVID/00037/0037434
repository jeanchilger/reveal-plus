In this study, we developed a pharmacophore model for the main proteinase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Then we used this pharmacophore model to search NCI 3D database including 250, 251 compounds and identified 30 existing drugs containing the pharmacophore query. Among them are six compounds that already exhibited anti-SARS-CoV activity experimentally. This means that our pharmacophore model can lead to the discovery of potent anti-SARS-CoV inhibitors or promising lead compounds for further SARS-CoV main proteinase inhibitor development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
