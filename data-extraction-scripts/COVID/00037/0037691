The problems of emerging and emerging diseases with drug resistance, latency, and reactivation along with the shorter life span of most synthetic agents or drugs have directed scientists to look into the treasure chests of nature to find out and explore the natural metabolites of plants for the management of diverse diseases including viral diseases. This chapter explains the treasure of “Ethnomedicine” and its journey through time, which reveals the importance of this branch of “natural science” in the current scenario, its potential as “alternative or complementary” medicine, especially against viral diseases with a detailed account of identified antivirals, their isolation and identification as “natural antiviral” to make the readers realize the need to accept “ethnomedicine” as appropriate alternatives to “synthetic chemistry.”&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
