<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-03-13</DATELINE><TITLE>Passive Immunization: Toward Magic Bullets</TITLE><BODY>Whereas active immunity refers to the process of exposing the individual to an antigen to generate an adaptive immune response, passive immunity refers to the transfer of antibodies from one individual to another. Passive immunity provides immediate but short-lived protection, lasting several weeks up to 3 or 4 months. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the fetus through the placenta or from breast milk to the gut of the infant. It can also be produced artificially, when antibody preparations derived from sera or secretions of immunized donors or, more recently, different antibody producing platforms are transferred via systemic or mucosal route to nonimmune individuals. Passive immunization has recently become an attractive approach because of the emergence of new and drug-resistant microorganisms, diseases that are unresponsive to drug therapy and individuals with an impaired immune system who are unable to respond to conventional vaccines. This chapter addresses the contributions of natural and artificial acquired passive immunity in understanding the concept of passive immunization. We will mainly focus on administration of antibodies for protection against various infectious agents entering through mucosal surfaces.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
