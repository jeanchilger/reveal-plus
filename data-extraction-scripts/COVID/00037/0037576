Complex 1 is a discrete dinuclear complex while complexes 2–4 are polymeric of which 2 and 3 have paddle wheel repeating units. Magnetic susceptibility measurements from polycrystalline samples of 1–4 revealed strong antiferromagnetic interactions within the {Cu2}4+ paddle wheel units and no discernible interactions between the units. The complex 5, [Cu(NicoNO)2·2H2O] n ·4nH2O, in which the bridging ligand to the adjacent copper(II) ions is nicotinate N-oxide (NicoNO) the transmitted interaction is very weakly antiferromagnetic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
