About 10% of them will be hospitalized, with significant physical and economic burdens. Objectives To compare two cohorts of infants with AVB, from same region, in a ten-year interval, regarding epidemiologic factors and viral etiology. Study design Cohorts: 142 (2004) and 172 (2014) infants at ages zero to 12 months; clinical diagnosis of AVB; medical care in hospital and genetic screening of nasopharyngeal secretion for respiratory viruses. Results The comparative analysis showed a difference in the percentage of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive patients [2004 (33.1%); 2014 (70.3%)] (p<0.01). No differences were noted regarding gender, breastfeeding, tobacco exposure, crowding and maternal education. There was a difference as to the month of incidence (seasonality) of AVB (higher in April 2014). There was a higher age at attendance in the first cohort, and lower birth weight and gestational age ratios in the second cohort (p<0.05). There were no differences in hospitalization time, need of mechanical ventilation and number of deaths, however a difference regarding co-morbidities was noted (higher in 2004) (p<0.001). Conclusion None of the analyzed variables had an impact on severity features. Virology and immunology must be considered in this kind of situation, by studying genetic variants and the maturation of the immune system in AVB by RSV or other viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
