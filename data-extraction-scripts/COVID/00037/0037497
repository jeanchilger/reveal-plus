Although rotavirus was extensively studied in China, few comprehensive studies of all viral agents related to diarrhea in children have been conducted. Objectives Our study was performed to investigate the role of enteric viruses in acute diarrhea in our country and to evaluate methods that could be used in routine diagnostics. Study design One hundred stool samples were collected from children under 5 years of age seeking medical care for acute diarrhea during the winter season 2000/2001 in Beijing Children's Hospital. All specimens were initially screened microscopically for leucocytes/red blood cells. Samples with negative results were analyzed for virus presence using commercial EIAs and/or in-house RT-PCRs. Results At least one viral agent was found in 67% of the specimens. The frequency of rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus and enteric adenovirus was 59%, 8%, 6% and 2%, respectively. Dual infections were found in 9.0% (6/67) of the positive samples. The results from rotavirus and astrovirus EIAs were concordant with those of rotavirus and astrovirus RT-PCRs. Conclusions Enteric viruses play an important role in pediatric diarrhea during the winter season in China. A combination of microscopic examination of stool samples with specific EIA assays to detect virus antigen in stool specimens may be suitable for routine diagnostics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
