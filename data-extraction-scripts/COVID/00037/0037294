ES-DMA is a rapid particle sizing method capable of characterizing certain aspects of the structure (such as capsid proteins) and obtaining complete size distributions of viruses and virus-like particles. It was shown that ES-DMA can distinguish intact virus particles from degraded particles and measure the concentration of virus particles when calibrated with nanoparticles of known concentration. The technique has a measurement uncertainty of ≈20%, is linear over nearly 3 orders of magnitude, and has a lower limit of detection of ≈109 particles/mL. This quantitative assay was demonstrated for non-enveloped viruses. It is expected that ES-DMA will be a useful method for applications involving production and quality control of vaccines and gene therapy vectors for human use.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
