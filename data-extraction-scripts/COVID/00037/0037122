<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Advanced Manufacturing Processes and Technologies</TITLE><BODY>A general framework of the emerging risks linked with advanced manufacturing processes and technologies is showed. For this, the systemic and occupational nature of said risks is considered. To achieve this general objective, the chapter is organized in two parts. In the first part, a theoretical basis is developed. This theoretical basis is configured by an explanation of the emerging risk concept, as well as by the development of an overview of advanced manufacturing processes and technologies. In the second part, contents and tools of practical application are exposed. To do this, the main emerging risks are shown first. Among the fields of application of these risks, some of the most important cross-cutting manufacturing technologies have been selected. One of the main risk governance frameworks is shown. Subsequently, this framework is deployed with two of its main applications on emerging risks: the management and characterization of the risk.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
