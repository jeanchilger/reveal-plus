They are targeted to translocon channels across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by signal peptides (SPs), which are temporary structures on the N-termini of their nascent chains. During translation, such proteins enter the lumen and membrane of the ER by a process known as co-translational translocation. Small molecules have been found that interfere with this process, decreasing protein expression by recognizing the unique structures of the SPs of particular proteins. The SP may thus become a validated target for designing drugs for numerous disorders, including certain hereditary diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
