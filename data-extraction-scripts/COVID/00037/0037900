The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Env binds to cell surface–associated receptor (CD4) and coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) by one of its two non-covalently associated subunits, gp120. The induced conformational changes activate the other subunit (gp41), which causes the fusion of the viral with the plasma cell membranes resulting in the delivery of the viral genome into the cell and the initiation of the infection cycle. As the only HIV protein exposed to the environment, the Env is also a major immunogen to which neutralizing antibodies are directed and a target that is relatively easy to access by inhibitors. A fundamental problem in the development of effective vaccines and inhibitors against HIV is the rapid generation of alterations at high levels of expression during long chronic infection and the resulting signiﬁcant heterogeneity of the Env. The preservation of the Env function as an entry mediator and limitations on size and expression impose restrictions on its variability and lead to the existence of conserved structures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
