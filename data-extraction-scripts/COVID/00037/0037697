<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Organoids – New Models for Host–Helminth Interactions</TITLE><BODY>Organoids are multicellular culture systems that replicate tissue architecture and function, and are increasingly used as models of viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections. Organoids have great potential to improve our current understanding of helminth interactions with their hosts and to replace or reduce the dependence on using animal models. In this review, we discuss the applicability of this technology to helminth infection research, including strategies of co-culture of helminths or their products with organoids and the challenges, advantages, and drawbacks of the use of organoids for these studies. We also explore how complementing organoid systems with other cell types and components may allow more complex models to be generated in the future to further investigate helminth–host interactions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
