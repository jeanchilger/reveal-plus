A two-phase modified Delphi survey of professionals with known expertise in One Health (‘expert panel’) was used to 1) identify key knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of GPs and veterinarians that would be consistent with a One Health approach to zoonoses; and 2) determine priorities for future surveys with Australian GPs and veterinarians to identify important gaps that impede effective diagnosis and management of zoonoses. A list of 13 topics/sub-topics, as well as a list of 25 specific zoonotic diseases/agents emerged from the first phase of the survey. In the second phase the expert panel identified general knowledge of the clinical aspects and epidemiological aspects of zoonoses, as well as risk management practices, as the most important KAPs and research priorities for both GPs and veterinarians. In terms of diseases, the expert panel regarded knowledge of Hendra virus, Q fever, Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), anthrax and Brucella suis most important for veterinarians, whilst for GPs, Q fever, gastrointestinal/foodborne diseases, influenza, ABLV and local vector-borne diseases were found to be most important by the expert panel. Some differences were noted in terms of prioritization of topics/sub-topics and diseases/agents according to expert background (veterinary and non-veterinary). The Delphi survey technique enabled efficient collection of data from a diverse range of One Health ‘experts’/specialists and provided clear priorities for proposed future research, and potentially for educational interventions to improve One Health efficacy of clinicians.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
