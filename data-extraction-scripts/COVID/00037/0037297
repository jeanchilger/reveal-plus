Of a total of 4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against four antigenic sites of S protein (Correa et al., 1988), 3 specific for sites A, B and D attached to the plasma membrane of infected cells, as disclosed by indirect immunofluorescence and by complement-mediated cytolysis. Four of the mAbs assayed were specific for the viral protein M and two of them gave plasma membrane immunofluorescence and mediated cytolysis in the presence of complement. The viral nucleoprotein N could not be demonstrated on the surface of infected cells either by iodination or employing 3 mAbs against this protein. Finally, a time course infection experiment demonstrated that S and M proteins were expressed on the surface of infected cells at 4 h after infection, before infective virus was released from infected cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
