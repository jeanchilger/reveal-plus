Of the 44 nucleotide changes, 13 resulted in conservative changes and 18 produced non-conservative changes. The results suggest that key amino acids in ORF1 may contribute to the phenotype of RespPRRS, which includes increased growth rate on MA-104 cells and decreased virulence in swine. The results provide a genetic basis for future manipulation of a PRRSV reverse genetics system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
