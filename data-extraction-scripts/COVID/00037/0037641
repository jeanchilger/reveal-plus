The aetiology of RL in cats is unknown, but inflammation is often seen in conjunction with RL. Vitamin D involvement has been suggested because 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) stimulates osteoclastogenesis, through up-regulation of the nuclear vitamin D receptor (nVDR). The aim of this study is to determine the involvement of inflammatory cytokines and the possible role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology of RL using quantitative PCR. We measured the mRNA expression of cytokines with stimulatory (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and inhibitory effects (IL-10 and IFN-γ) on osteoclastogenesis, and the mRNA expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and nVDR in RL samples. We found increased expression of mRNA levels for inflammatory cytokines and nVDR, but not for RANKL and OPG, in tissue from RL-affected cats compared with tissue from radiological confirmed healthy controls. The mRNA levels of nVDR were positively correlated with mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ), anti-inflammatory (IL-10), pro-resorptive (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), and anti-resorptive (IFN-γ and IL-10) cytokines in the course of resorptive lesions. These data are consistent with our view that both inflammation and an overexpression of the nVDR are likely to be involved in RL in cats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
