This cross-sectional study determined the contamination of ID badges and lanyards worn by pediatric HCWs with common respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses. The results showed that ID badges and lanyards are not significantly contaminated with common respiratory or gastrointestinal viruses and are unlikely to be a significant vector for nosocomial infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
