We demonstrate that murine norovirus (MNV) infection can significantly impair B cell development in the bone marrow in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) dependent, but interferon signaling independent manner. We also show that MNV replication is more pronounced in the absence of STAT1 in ex vivo cultured B cells. Interestingly, using bone marrow transplantation studies, we found that impaired B cell development requires Stat1(−/−) hematopoietic cells and Stat1(−/−) stromal cells, and that the presence of wild-type hematopoietic or stromal cells was sufficient to restore normal development of Stat1(−/−) B cells. These results suggest that B cells normally restrain norovirus replication in a cell autonomous manner, and that wild-type STAT1 is required to protect B cell development during infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
