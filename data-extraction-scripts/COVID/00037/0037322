RA is characterized by the clinical findings of synovial inflammation, autoantibody production, and cartilage/bone destruction, cardiovascular, pulmonary and skeletal disorders. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were responsible for the induction of inflammation in RA patients. Drawbacks such as poor efficacy, higher doses, frequent administration, low responsiveness, and higher cost and serious side effects were associated with the conventional dosage forms for RA treatment. Nanomedicines were recently gaining more interest towards the treatment of RA, and researchers were also focusing towards the development of various anti-inflammatory drug loaded nanoformulations with an aid to both actively/passively targeting the inflamed site to afford an effective treatment regimen for RA. Alterations in the surface area and nanoscale size of the nanoformulations elicit beneficial physical and chemical properties for better pharmacological activities. These drug loaded nanoformulations may enhances the solubility of poorly water soluble drugs, improves the bioavailability, affords targetability and may improve the therapeutic activity. In this regimen, the present review focus towards the novel nanoparticulate formulations (nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanomicelles, and nanocapsules) utilized for the treatment of RA. The recent advancements such as siRNA, peptide and targeted based nanoparticulate systems for RA treatment were also discussed. Special emphasis was provided regarding the pathophysiology, prevalence and symptoms towards the development of RA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
