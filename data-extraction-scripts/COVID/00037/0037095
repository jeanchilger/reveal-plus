Expression microarray analysis showed up-regulation and down-regulation of many genes involved in the defense, inflammatory response and intracellular signaling pathways including chemokine, apoptosis, MAPK, Notch, Jak-STAT, T-cell receptor and complement and coagulation cascades. We have revealed signature patterns of gene expression in mice infected with two different classes of pathogens: influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR results confirmed microarray results for most of the genes tested. These studies document clear differences in gene expression profiles between mice infected with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. Identification of genes that are differentially expressed after respiratory infections can provide insights into the mechanisms by which the host interacts with different pathogens, useful information about stage of diseases and selection of suitable targets for early diagnosis and treatments. The advantage of this novel approach is that the detection of pathogens is based on the differences in host gene expression profiles in response to different pathogens instead of detecting pathogens directly.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
