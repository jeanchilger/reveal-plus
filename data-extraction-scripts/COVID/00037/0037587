Turkey poults were orally inoculated with TCV at 10 d of age, and the immune responses were analyzed at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 63 d postinfection (PI) in three different experiments. Total Ig to TCV was initially detected at 7 and 14 d PI in Experiments 1 and 3. In addition, Ig gradually increased from 7 to 21 d PI and remained at 80 immunofluroescent antibody assay (IFA) titers or more thereafter. Lymphocyte proliferation responses of spleen cells to concanavalin A were higher in TCV-infected turkeys than in noninfected control turkeys with significant differences (P < 0.05) being noted at 14 and 63 d PI in Experiment 2 and at 3 and 28 d PI in Experiment 3. Strong IFA staining response to TCV antigen was observed in intestines of turkeys at 1, 3, and 7 d PI, and the response declined from 14 to 28 d PI in Experiment 3. In Experiment 3, the IgG isotype antibody response to TCV was markedly increased after 21 d PI and remained high until 63 d PI. The IgM isotype antibody response to TCV was 1.40 and 0.91 at 7 and 14 d PI, respectively. The IgA isotype antibody response to TCV was very low as detected at 7 (0.13), 14 (0.20), and 21 (0.17) d PI. Turkeys infected with TCV had significantly higher (P < 0.05) antibody response to sheep erythrocytes than noninfected controls at 7 d PI. Virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation response of spleen cells was significantly stimulated (P < 0.05) at 63 d PI in Experiment 3. The proportion of the CD4+ subpopulation of T lymphocytes was significantly increased (P < 0.05) at 1, 7, and 21 d PI in Experiment 3. The results indicate that humoral and cellular immunities to TCV are elicited in turkeys following infection with TCV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
