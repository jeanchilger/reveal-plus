<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-07-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Bioterrorism—Types of epidemics, new epidemiological paradigm and levels of prevention</TITLE><BODY>Summary Biological attacks can cause both an epidemic of infectious disease and of fear and panic. Epidemiological triangle chain models can be used to present both these types of epidemic. By merging these two triangles we suggest a new four-sided pyramidal model of bioterrorism attack and appropriate levels of prevention. Primordial prevention of biological attacks should comprise the impeding of access of both terrorists and biological agents to the territory. The primary prevention level should comprise internal surveillance of potential sources of agents and terrorists. Secondary prevention activities should be directed toward breaking both the epidemic of infectious disease and that of fear and panic. Tertiary prevention should include measures for repair following the attack. This is a task mainly for mental health professionals, curing and rehabilitating those affected by the epidemic of fear and panic. The suggested epidemiological model can be implemented into training programmes for detecting and responding to bioterrorist attacks around the world.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
