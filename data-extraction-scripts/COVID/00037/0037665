In this study, we report the development of an integrated isothermal device for both amplification and detection of targeted HBV DNA. It has two major components, a disposable polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) micro-reactor and a temperature-regulated optical detection unit (base apparatus) for real-time monitoring of the turbidity changes due to the precipitation of DNA amplification by-product, magnesium pyrophosphate. We have established a correlation curve (R 2 =0.99) between the concentration of pyrophosphate ions and the level of turbidity by using a simulated chemical reaction to evaluate the characteristics of our device. For the applications of rapid pathogens detection, we also have established a standard curve (R 2 =0.96) by using LAMP reaction with a standard template in our device. Moreover, we also have successfully used the device on seven clinical serum specimens where HBV DNA levels have been confirmed by real-time PCR. The result indicates that different amounts of HBV DNA can be successfully detected by using this device within 1h.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
