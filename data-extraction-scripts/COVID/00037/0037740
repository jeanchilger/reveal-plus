<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1984-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Sequence of the membrane protein gene from avian coronavirus IBV</TITLE><BODY>Abstract cDNA clones prepared from genomic RNA of coronavirus IBV have been sequenced. The nucleotide sequence for the complete 5' region of mRNA C, which is not present in mRNAs A and B, has been determined. A sequence of 1224 bases is presented which contains a long open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of molecular weight 25 443. This is in agreement with the molecular weight of 23 000 reported for the unglycosylated form of the membrane polypeptide.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
