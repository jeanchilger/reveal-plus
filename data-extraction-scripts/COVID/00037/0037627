<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-07-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Biology and Diseases of Rabbits</TITLE><BODY>Beginning in 1931, an inbred rabbit colony was developed at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis at the University of Pennsylvania. This colony was used to study natural resistance to infection with tuberculosis (Robertson et al., 1966). Other inbred colonies or well-defined breeding colonies were also developed at the University of Illinois College of Medicine Center for Genetics, the Laboratories of the International Health Division of The Rockefeller Foundation, the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, and Jackson Laboratories. These colonies were moved or closed in the years to follow. Since 1973, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported the total number of certain species of animals used by registered research facilities (1997). In 1973, 447,570 rabbits were used in research. There has been an overall decrease in numbers of rabbits used. This decreasing trend started in the mid-1990s. In 2010, 210,172 rabbits were used in research. Despite the overall drop in the number used in research, the rabbit is still a valuable model and tool for many disciplines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
