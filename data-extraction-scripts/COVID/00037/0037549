Despite the huge clinical impact of flaviviruses, there is no specific human antiviral therapy available to treat infection with any of the flaviviruses. Therefore, there is a continued search for novel therapies, and this review describes the current knowledge on the usage of RNA interference (RNAi) in combating flavivirus infections. RNAi is a process of sequence-specific gene silencing triggered by double-stranded RNA. Antiviral RNAi strategies against arthropod-borne flaviviruses have been reported and although several hurdles must be overcome to employ this technology in clinical applications, they potentially represent a new therapeutic tool.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
