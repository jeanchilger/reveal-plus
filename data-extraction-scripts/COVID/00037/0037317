<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-08-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Pulmonary Infections Following Lung Transplantation</TITLE><BODY>Infectious complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. Infections with viruses, bacteria, and fungi have all been associated with the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (chronic allograft rejection) in lung transplant recipients. Lung transplant recipients have a higher risk of infectious complications than recipients of other solid organs because of the intensity of immunosuppression, blunted cough mechanism, and constant exposure to the environment. This review provides a broad overview of the infectious complications encountered in caring for patients who have undergone lung transplantation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
