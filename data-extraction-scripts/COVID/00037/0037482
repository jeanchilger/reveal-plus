<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-04-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Nanostructuring Biopolymers for Improved Food Quality and Safety</TITLE><BODY>Food-grade biopolymers, apart from their inherent nutritional properties, can be tailored designed for improving food quality and safety, either serving as delivery vehicles for bioactive molecules, or as novel packaging components, not only improving the transport properties of biobased packaging structures, but also imparting active antibacterial and antiviral properties. In this chapter, the potential of different food-grade biopolymers (mainly proteins and carbohydrates but also some biopolyesters) to serve as encapsulating matrices for the protection of sensitive bioactives or as nanostructured packaging layers to improve transport properties and control the growth of pathogenic bacteria and viruses are described based on some developments carried out by the authors, as well as the most prominent works found in literature in this area.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
