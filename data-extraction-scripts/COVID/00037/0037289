The test is based on a proprietary technology that combines the principles of immunochromatography and fluid dynamics. Gold nanoparticles conjugated to staphylococcal protein A (SPA) were prepared in liquid form and used as signal vehicles. T. gondii-specific recombinant antigens and SPA were sprayed onto a nitrocellulose membrane in strips at positions designated as T and C, respectively. The DFICT is performed by applying a 100 µL aliquot of liquid gold-SPA conjugate to the reagent hole and a 5 μL aliquot of serum sample to the sample hole. The results were observable within 5 min by the naked eye. The lowest detectable limit of the assay was determined as the highest dilution (1:320) of positive serum. No cross-reaction of the antibodies with other related canine or feline pathogens was observed. The DFICT can be stored for 12 months at 4 °C or 6 months with no loss of sensitivity or specificity. A high degree of consistency was observed between the DFICT and the standard ELISA kit, supporting the reliability of the novel test strip. The introduction of a liquid gold nanoparticle conjugate reagent provides this method with several attractive characteristics, such as ease of manufacture, low sample volume requirements, high selectivity and high efficiency. This method opens a novel pathway for rapid diagnostic screening and field analysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
