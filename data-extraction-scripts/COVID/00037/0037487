Markov matrices provide a convenient way to perform contaminant transport analysis. However, no standardized method exists for calculating these matrices. A methodology based on set theory is developed for calculating contaminant transport in real-time utilizing Markov matrices from CFD flow data (or discrete flow field data). The methodology provides a rigorous yet simple strategy for determining the number and size of the Markov states, the time step associated with the Markov matrix, and calculation of individual entries of the Markov matrix. The procedure is benchmarked against scalar transport of validated airflow fields in enclosed and ventilated spaces. The approach can be applied to any general airflow field, and is shown to calculate contaminant transport over 3000 times faster than solving the corresponding scalar transport partial differential equation. This near real-time methodology allows for the development of more robust sensing and control procedures of critical care environments (clean rooms and hospital wards), small enclosed spaces (like airplane cabins) and high traffic public areas (train stations and airports).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
