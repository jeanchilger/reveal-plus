Demyelination occurs in infected white matter areas in the absence of inflammation. The mechanism of demyelination is not apparent because there is no ultrastructural evidence of viral replication in the oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells. However, brain tissue culture studies have shown that oligodendrocytes support transcription of all CDV genes and later on degenerate, although no viral proteins can be found in these cells. It remains to be shown how such a restricted infection leads to demyelination. Concomitant with immunologic recovery during the further course of the disease, inflammation occurs in the demyelinating lesions with progression of the lesions in some animals. A series of experiments in vitro suggested that chronic demyelination is due to a bystander mechanism associated with the virus-induced immune response in which antibody dependent cell-mediated reactions play an important role. The progressive, or even relapsing, course of the disease is associated with viral persistence in the nervous system. Persistence of CDV in the brain appears to be due to non-cytolytic selective spread of the virus with very limited budding. In this way CDV escapes immune surveillance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
