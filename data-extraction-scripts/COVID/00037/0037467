<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Pretravel Considerations for Non-vaccine-Preventable Travel Infections</TITLE><BODY>Pretravel advice should be tailored to the individual following a thorough review of his or her itinerary, planned activities, and host characteristics. In addition to vaccinations and malaria chemoprophylaxis, a pretravel consultation should include advice on regionally endemic or emerging non–vaccine-preventable infections that can cause severe illness or chronic morbidity. These include mosquito-borne infections such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and regionally endemic severe respiratory infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and some strains of avian influenza. Zika virus is notable given its capacity for sexual transmission and association with congenital birth defects. Preventive advice for other potentially relevant infections associated with specific exposures or activities (e.g., schistosomiasis and leptospirosis from freshwater exposure) should be provided where relevant. Understanding the epidemiology and prevention of these infections is crucial to providing a comprehensive pretravel consultation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
