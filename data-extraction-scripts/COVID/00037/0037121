<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-10-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Lectin-like interactions in virus–cell recognition: Human immunodeficiency virus and C-type lectin interactions</TITLE><BODY>The calcium-dependent lectin dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is involved in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interactions with dendritic cells. Attachment of HIV to dendritic cells can potentiate viral infectivity for adjacent T-cells and it has been postulated that this process contributes to the dissemination of sexually transmitted virus. More recent research has revealed that the consequences of lectin-dependent HIV interactions with dendritic cells are diverse and can include uptake for major histocompatibility complex presentation, productive infection, and transfer of virus to T-cells. This chapter introduces DC-SIGN and other cellular lectins known to recognize HIV, and discusses how lectin binding might impact viral dissemination. An intricate interplay between viruses and C-type lectins impacts the balance between viral attack and host defense, as specified below for HIV, and elucidation of the underlying mechanisms can provide important insights into the pathogenesis of viral infections and may uncover attractive targets for therapy and prevention.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
