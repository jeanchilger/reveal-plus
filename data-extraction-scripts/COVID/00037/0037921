The basis of the assay is the cleavage of target RNA by RNase H mediated by sequence-specific chimeric oligonucleotides followed by sample to residual ratio quantitation (SRRQ) using RRT-PCR. Four serotype-specific chimeric oligonucleotides were designed, one each for the Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arkansas, and Delaware/Georgia 98 serotypes, and tested for their ability to mediate specific cleavage of target RNA from known homologous and heterologous strains of IBV. Specific cleavage of target RNAs by each chimeric oligonucleotide was verified using agarose gel analysis and RRT-PCR. There were no non-specific cleavage products. Eight different IBV strains representing seven serotypes were tested and each chimeric oligonucleotide mediated cleavage of target RNA only from strains within the serotype that the chimeric was designed against. The SRRQ assay was evaluated on 15 samples without prior knowledge of their grouping and correctly identified the serotype of each sample. The assay is rapid; six samples can be tested in approximately 4h. In addition, the primer set amplifies all IBV RNAs tested to date and provides a built in control for detecting IBV whether it is typeable or not.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
