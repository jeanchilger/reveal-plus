<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-03-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Avian diseases which affect egg production and quality</TITLE><BODY>This chapter addresses diseases and syndromes which have been shown, or are reported, to have adverse effects on egg production and quality. However, any disease of poultry can adversely affect egg production and quality indirectly, by affecting the health of the bird. The main topics are the effect on egg production and quality of bacteria (Salmonella, Mycoplasma, Escherichia coli, infectious coryza, Ornithobacterium, Gallibacterium, spirochaetosis), viruses (infectious bronchitis virus, egg drop syndrome, swollen head syndrome, avian encephalomyelitis, influenza, Newcastle disease, laryngotracheitis), syndromes (fatty liver haemorrhagic syndrome, cage layer osteoporosis) and toxic agents. A short section on clinical perspectives reports on information obtained from practising poultry veterinarians as such observations can provide valuable starting points for future research.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
