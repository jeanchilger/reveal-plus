<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-09-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Vaccine Target Discovery</TITLE><BODY>With the rise in novel infectious agents and disease pandemics, a new era of vaccine discovery is necessary. To address this, the new field of immunomics is described, which is synergistically powered by integrating bioinformatics methodologies with technological advances in biology and high-throughput instrumentation. By incorporating biological data from immunology and molecular biology with current genomics and proteomics, immunomics is geared to deliver an insight into immune function, optimal stimulation of immune responses and precise mapping and rational selection of immune targets that cover antigenic diversity. These efforts are expected to contribute towards the development of new generation of vaccines, tailored to both the genetic make-up of the human population and of the pathogen. Vaccine technologies are also being explored for prevention or control of non-communicable diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
