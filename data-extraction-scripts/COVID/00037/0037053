However, few studies have been conducted on the infection of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. in peafowl up to now. The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence and the involved genotypes of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi in peafowl in Beijing and Jiangxi Province, China. In total, 258 peafowl fecal samples were collected. Overall, both Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi had the same prevalence, i.e. 6.59% (17/258). Higher infection rates of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. were found in the adolescent peafowl. The prevalence of E. bieneusi in Beijing and Jiangxi Province was 5.23% and 8.57% respectively. For Cryptosporidium spp., the prevalence was 4.58% and 9.52% in Beijing and Jiangxi Province, respectively. Three zoonotic genotypes of E. bieneusi were confirmed, including two known genotypes, genotype Peru 6 and D, and one novel genotype, JXP1. Two avian specific species/genotypes of Cryptosporidium, Avian genotype Ⅲ and Goose genotype Ⅰ, were identified. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. occurrence in peafowl in China. The findings suggest that peafowl could be reservoirs of E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. which could be potentially transmitted to humans and other animals, and the present survey have implications for controlling E. bieneusi and Cryptosporidium spp. infection in peafowl.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
