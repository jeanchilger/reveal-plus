These viral glycoproteins need to be activated which leads to extensive conformational changes that trigger the insertion or attachment of a fusion peptide in or to cellular target membranes thus bridging two bilayers. Further refolding into a hairpin-like structure pulls viral and cellular membranes into close apposition, a process that leads to lipid bilayer fusion. Although viral fusion proteins belong to three different classes based on their structural organization, they follow similar structural principles to achieve fusion.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
