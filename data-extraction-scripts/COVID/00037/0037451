However, current traditional inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines are of limited efficacy against circulating PEDV variants, and there are no commercial vaccines for prevention of PDCoV and SADS-CoV. RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool in therapeutic applications to inhibit viral replication in vitro. In this study, we developed a small interfering RNA generation system that expressed two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the M gene of PEDV and SADS-CoV and the N gene of PDCoV, respectively. Our results demonstrated that simultaneous expression of these specific shRNA molecules inhibited expression of PEDV M gene, SADS-CoV M gene, and PDCoV N gene RNA by 99.7%, 99.4%, and 98.8%, respectively, in infected cell cultures. In addition, shRNA molecules significantly restricted the expression of M and N protein, and impaired the replication of PEDV, SADS-CoV, and PDCoV simultaneously. Taken together, this shRNAs expression system not only is proved to be a novel approach for studying functions of various genes synchronously, but also developed to test aspects of a potential therapeutic option for treatment and prevention of multiple SECoV infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
