<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-07-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Human Eye Infections</TITLE><BODY>The eye contains a variety of cell and tissue types. Conjunctivitis due to respiratory RNA viruses represents by far the most common viral eye disorder. However, any ocular tissue can sustain infection by human viruses, including those viruses with predilection for neural sites. As elsewhere in the body, ocular pathologic changes induced by viruses tend to follow stereotypical patterns. Classical viral mechanisms of infection, including latency, reactivation, and carcinogenesis, can all be demonstrated in the eye. The eye's tissues also demonstrate a wide variety of immune responses, including those of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and immune privilege. The ocular complications of AIDS, including viral retinitis and ocular surface squamous carcinoma, remain significant causes of morbidity throughout the world.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
