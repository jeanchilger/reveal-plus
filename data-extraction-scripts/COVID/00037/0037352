<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-06-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Beyond Mfold: Recent advances in RNA bioinformatics</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Computational analysis of RNA secondary structure is a classical field of biosequence analysis, which has recently gained momentum due to the manyfold regulatory functions of RNA that have become apparent. We present five recent computational approaches that address the problems of synoptic folding space analysis, pseudoknot prediction, structure alignment, comparative structure prediction, and miRNA target prediction. All these programs are in current use and are available via the Bielefeld Bioinformatics Server at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
