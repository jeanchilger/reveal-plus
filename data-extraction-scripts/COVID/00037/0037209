<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Rhinitis</TITLE><BODY>Rhinitis is caused by a variety of allergic and nonallergic mechanisms. Mild disease can usually be managed with avoidance measures alone. Allergen removal can also improve the severity of allergic rhinitis and can reduce the need for medications. Allergic rhinitis is represented by sneezing, nasal congestion, nasal pruritus, and rhinorrhea. Oral antihistamines should be used to treat patients with mild or occasional seasonal allergic rhinitis. Because of the variance in causes of nonallergic rhinitis, treatments also vary. Irrigation and debridement are the standard treatment of atrophic rhinitis. For gustatory rhinitis, pretreatment with ipratropium bromide can be used.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
