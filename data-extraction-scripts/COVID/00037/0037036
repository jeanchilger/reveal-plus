<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Bacterial Pneumonia in Older Adults</TITLE><BODY>The incidence of pneumonia increases with age, and is particularly high in patients who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Mortality rates for pneumonia in older adults are high and have not decreased in the last decade. Atypical symptoms and exacerbation of underlying illnesses should trigger clinical suspicion of pneumonia. Risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms are more common in older adults, particularly among LTCF residents, and should be considered when making empiric treatment decisions. Monitoring of clinical stability and underlying comorbid conditions, potential drug–drug interactions, and drug-related adverse events are important factors in managing elderly patients with pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
