Rapid diagnosis using molecular techniques is essential to improve patient survival. PCR techniques are promising in enhancing Aspergillus detection in blood and respiratory samples. We evaluate for the first time the performances of two commercial real-time PCR kits, the A. fumigatus Bio-Evolution and the MycoGENIE A. fumigatus for the detection of A. fumigatus DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from patients with and without IPA. Seventy-three BAL samples were included. Thirty-one of them corresponded to patients with probable IPA, 11 to patients with possible IPA, and 31 to patients without aspergillosis, according to the 2008 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria. In the probable IPA group, A. fumigatus Bio-Evolution and the MycoGENIE A. fumigatus real-time PCR kits showed a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 81% and 71%, respectively. The A. fumigatus Bio-Evolution detected Aspergillus DNA in the 14 BAL samples with a positive Aspergillus culture result, whereas the MycoGENIE A. fumigatus PCR result was positive only for 12. In the possible IPA group, there were no positive real-time PCR or positive Aspergillus culture results. For the patients without aspergillosis, no positive result was observed for real-time PCR kit, despite the presence of various other non-Aspergillus pathogens in this group. Our study demonstrates an excellent specificity and a good sensitivity of A. fumigatus DNA detection in BAL samples with both kits.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
