<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>New Technologies: Ethics of Genomics</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Genomics, as a branch of genetics, uses Genome-Wide Association Studies and Whole-Genome Sequencing approaches to investigate how molecular structure, haplotype variation, and gene–environment complexity affect geno- and phenotypes, and invoke other life science system studies and -omics. Genomic medicine is quantitatively different from genetics, using variants as markers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention, as well as targets for treatment. Public Health Genomics extends these studies into population-wide variation and their impact on evidence-based policy, health systems, and health delivery and resources. The clinical significance of public health genomics will grow as sequencing becomes possible with low error rates, using better analytical methods that signal which variants are clinically significant, and the development of technologies that allow long-term stability of data storage. The most promising technologies cannot fully realize their potential if the relevant policy, legal, and regulatory issues are not adequately addressed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
