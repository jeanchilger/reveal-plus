The participating 135 herds were randomly selected from those in The Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System with at least 15 cow years. Each herd was followed for 1 yr. Blood samples from calves of >150 d of age (n = 1,348) were analyzed for antibodies against parainfluenza virus 3, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and Mycoplasma bovis. Calves reported to have been on pasture (n = 139) were tested for antibodies against Dictyocaulus viviparus. Seroprevalences for parainfluenza virus 3, BCoV, BRSV, and D. viviparus at the calf level were 50.2, 39.3, 31.2, and 4.3%, respectively. No calves were antibody positive for M. bovis. Calves in herds with BCoV-seropositive calves had an increased risk of respiratory disease compared with herds in which BCoV antibodies were not detected [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.9], as had calves in herds in which the majority (>54%) of the sampled calves were seropositive for BRSV (HR = 2.7). Other factors found to increase the risk of respiratory disease in calves were shared housing with cows during the first week of life compared with separate housing (HR = 16.7), a larger herd size (>50 cow years) compared with smaller herds (HR = 8.2), more than an 8-wk age difference between calves housed together in the same group pen compared with having pen mates of a more similar age (HR = 3.9), previous recordings of diarrhea compared with no recorded diarrhea (HR = 3.9), and leaving calves with dams for >24 h after birth compared with earlier separation (HR = 3.5).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
