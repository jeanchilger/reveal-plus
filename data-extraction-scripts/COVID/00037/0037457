However, some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is associated with excessive host response including a cell-mediated immune reaction. During the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus infections in Korea, we experienced a dramatic effect of immune-modulators (corticosteroids) on the patients with severe pneumonia who had significant respiratory distress at presentation and those who showed rapidly progressive pneumonia during oseltamivir treatment. We also found that the pneumonia patients treated with corticosteroids showed the lowest lymphocyte differential and that the severity of pneumonia was associated with the lymphocyte count at presentation. From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of ‘protein homeostasis system’; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system. These substances reach the lung cells, the main target organ, via the systemic circulation, and possibly the cells of other organs, including myocytes or central nerve system cells, leading to extrapulmonary symptoms (e.g., myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy). To control these substances that may be possibly toxic to host cells, the adaptive immune reaction may be operated by immune cells, mainly lymphocytes. Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells produces higher levels of cytokines which may be associated with acute lung injury, and may be controlled by early use of immune-modulators. Early initiation and proper dosage of immune-modulators with antiviral agents for severe pneumonia patients may reduce morbidity and prevent progressive fatal pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
