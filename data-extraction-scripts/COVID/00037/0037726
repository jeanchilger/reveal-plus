In this study, we found that PEDV infected not only the small intestines, but also the respiratory tract. Infection and replication of PEDV in the respiratory tract from naturally PEDV-infected piglets were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and virus re-isolation. Our observations were confirmed by experimental inoculation, and we found that PEDV infection in the respiratory tract was specifically associated with alveolar macrophages in the lung. Vero cell-adapted PEDV was able to replicate in both primary alveolar macrophages and continuous porcine alveolar macrophage cells. Sequencing analysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that mutations in S might be a potential determinant of auxiliary targets for PEDV. The discovery that PEDV infects and replicates in alveolar macrophages provides new insights into its pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
