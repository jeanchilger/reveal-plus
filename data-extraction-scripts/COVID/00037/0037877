DPP4 enzymatic inhibitors were first developed as anti-diabetic reagents which preserve incretin hormones and promote post-prandial insulin secretion. It's been shown in animal studies that incretin-based therapy has a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease. Recent studies demonstrated novel non-catalytic functions of DPP4 that may play a role in cardiometabolic disease. Although the role of DPP4 inhibition-mediated incretin effects has been well-reviewed, little information of its incretin-independent actions was introduced in cardiometabolic disease. In the current review, we will summarize the catalytic dependent and independent effects of DPP4 inhibition on cardiometabolic disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
