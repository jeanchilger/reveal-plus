The isolates showed genomic variation and eight different profiles were observed, including one which was atypical for Group A rotaviruses. The 3′ terminal labelling method for the analysis of genome profiles used in this study required only 1 ng of viral RNA, an increase of 1000-fold in sensitivity over ethidium bromide staining for detecting all rotavirus genome segments. However, dual infections involving two rotaviruses with distinct profiles could not be detected if the concentrations of the viruses differed by > 10-fold.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
