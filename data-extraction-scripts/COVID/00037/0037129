METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens from 100 HCPs were collected from Huntsville Hospital (Huntsville, AL) during the winter and from 100 HCPs during the summer. All subjects were tested for 22 viruses and 19 bacteria using Target Enriched Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction. Both seasonal cohorts were composed of students, nurses, physicians, and residents. RESULTS: Of the 100 HCPs tested during the winter, 34 subjects were colonized with at least 1 bacterium, and 11 tested positive for at least 1 virus. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Moraxella catarrhalis, and coronavirus were the most frequently detected potentially infectious agents. Of the 100 HCPs tested during the summer, 37 tested positive for at least 1 bacterium, and 4 tested positive for a viral agent. The most prevalent bacteria were MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal carriage among asymptomatic HCPs was common, but the frequency and presence of potential pathogens varied with each season. Understanding the colonization and infection potential of upper respiratory organisms is important, particularly for viruses. Although asymptomatic HCPs certainly harbor a number of different potentially infectious agents, future studies are needed to determine whether colonized pathogens are transmitted or initiate infection in at-risk patient populations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
