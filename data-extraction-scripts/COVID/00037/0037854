Recent results have implicated −1PRF in quality control of mRNA and DNA stability in eukaryotes. Biophysical experiments demonstrated that the ribosome changes the reading frame while attempting to move over a slippery sequence of the mRNA – when a roadblock formed by a folded downstream segment in the mRNA stalls the ribosome in a metastable conformational state. The efficiency of −1PRF is modulated not only by cis-regulatory elements in the mRNA but also by trans-acting factors such as proteins, miRNAs, and antibiotics. These recent results suggest a molecular mechanism and new important cellular roles for −1PRF.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
