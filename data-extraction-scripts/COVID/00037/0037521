<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-04-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Priapism in a castrated cat associated with feline infectious peritonitis</TITLE><BODY>This report describes a case of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in a castrated cat which first presented with the unusual sign of priapism. Laboratory examinations showed increased serum protein content and decreased albumin/globulin ratio. Serum electrophoresis revealed increased α2- and γ-globulin content. One month after the first examination, the cat died. At necropsy, histopathological evaluation of organs showed inflammatory granulomatous lesions compatible with non-effusive FIP and coronavirus-specific polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis. FIP antigen was demonstrated immunohistochemically in penile tissue.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
