Virus generates drug resistance through fast mutagenesis and escapes antiviral treatment. siRNAs targeting different genes would be an alternative for overcoming drug resistance. Here, we report effective siRNAs targeting structural genes (i.e., spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) and their antiviral kinetics. We also showed the synergistic effects of two siRNAs targeting different functional genes at a very low dose. Our findings may pave a way to develop cost effective siRNA agents for antiviral therapy in the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
