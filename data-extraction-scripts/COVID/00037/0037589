<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-04</DATELINE><TITLE>The Role of Augmented Intelligence (AI) in Detecting and Preventing the Spread of Novel Coronavirus</TITLE><BODY>The 2019-nCov will not be the last epidemic to challenge public health experts. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks early will be key to our improvement of prediction, prevention, and detection of future global health risks. The devastating situation in Wuhan, China and future epidemics will also find value in ongoing research in 2019-nCov case detection, spread prediction, treatment effectiveness, and containment. The wide variety, velocity, and veracity of data now available in crises yield data sets that many researchers will now need to incorporate into evermore complex models. This requires expansion of talent within AI for healthcare applications. AI is no longer a niche research area nor is it a tool for the most advanced healthcare systems only, its global impact on healthcare is real and its potential to save lives in this epidemic as well as future epidemics should not be underestimated. It is critical to the global health of all humankind for the scientific community to embrace AI and leverage its power in securing our collective future.ER -&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
