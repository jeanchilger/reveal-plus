Among these, several 5′-O-masked analogues of 6-chloropurine-2′-deoxyriboside (e.g., 5′-O-benzoyl, 5′-O-p-methoxybenzoyl, and 5′-O-benzyl analogues) were found to exhibit effective anti-HCV activity. In particular, the 5′-O-benzoyl analogue exhibited the highest potency with an EC50 of 6.1μM in a cell-based HCV replicon assay. Since the 5′-O-unmasked analogue (i.e., 6-chloropurine-2′-deoxyriboside) was not sufficiently potent (EC50 =47.2μM), masking of the 5′-hydroxyl group seems to be an effective method for the development of anti-HCV agents. Presently, we hypothesize two roles for the 5′-O-masked analogues: One is the role as an anti-HCV agent by itself, and the other is as a prodrug of its 5′-O-demasked (deprotected) derivative.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
