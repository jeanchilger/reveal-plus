It was indispensable for generating coronavirus-specific ELISA antibody activities that the sample was applied to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cells in parallel with the CCV-infected cells and then the optical density values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen. On the basis of ELISA antibody titers obtained in sera from the cats experimentally infected with CCV and from the spontaneous feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) cases, the ELISA described in the present study was found to be applicable as a simple and easy serologic test which was able to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies as efficiently as the indirect immunofluorescence assay with homologous FIP virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
