Housing did not affect food intake, weight gain, fecal output or fibre content, serum liver enzymes, or spleen and mesenteric lymph node immune cell populations. Bedding-housed rat feces were enriched in phylotypes aligning within the phylum Firmicutes (families Lactobacillaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae) and had a 2-fold lower content of phylotypes aligning within the phylum Bacteroidetes. Feces from bedding-housed rats also contained significantly more acetic acid and less propionic, isobutyric, valeric and isovaleric acids than those housed on wire. Bedding-housed rats had significantly higher splenic concentrations of interleukin-4 (P < 0.001). These results demonstrate that bedding can indirectly influence systemic and mucosal immune measures, potentially adding additional complexities and confounding results to nutrition studies investigating the health effects of dietary fibres.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
