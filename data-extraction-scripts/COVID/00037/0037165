In addition to the classic modification of the host endocrine system by either direct or indirect destruction of the endocrine organs and/or effects exerted by systemic production of inflammatory and/or stress mediators, recent progress in molecular virology and endocrinology has revealed that virus-encoded molecules might alter the host endocrine-signaling systems by affecting extracellular and/or intracellular signal transduction and hormone sensitivity of host target tissues. Here, we provide a brief overview of such viral-mediated modulation of host endocrine signaling systems. We propose that virus-encoded molecules and the signaling systems they influence are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of disorders that are associated with some viral infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
