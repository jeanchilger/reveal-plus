The clinical and radiographic data are usually sufficient to diagnose infectious pneumonia. On the contrary, the etiological diagnosis is more difficult to establish because many pathogens are known, but with non-specific reactions of the lung parenchyma. Outside exceptional cases, the radiological lesions have low specificity. Understanding the physiological mechanisms can explain some radiological aspects. Similarly, knowledge of the radiological and pathological mechanisms involved can enable adequate recognition of three main radiographic features. Epidemiology and immunology depend on the causal agent.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
