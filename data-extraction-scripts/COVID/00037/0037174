<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-06-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Significant Transplantation-Related Mortality from Respiratory Virus Infections within the First One Hundred Days in Children after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</TITLE><BODY>Respiratory viral infections (RVI) are important in hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) and knowledge regarding incidence, morbidity, mortality, and long-term pulmonary complications is limited. We report a study to evaluate incidence and outcomes, both short and long-term, of RVI in children receiving HSCT. Between January 2000 and December 2012, 844 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at the Hospital for Sick Children: 491 were allogeneic and 353 were autologous. When screening for causes of death in the first year after HSCT in the 844 patients, we found that RVI as a cause of death was only evident in the first 100 days after HSCT. Fifty-four (6.5%) patients were found to have an RVI within the first 100 days after HSCT (allogeneic = 32, autologous = 22). Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were documented in 31 (57%) and 23 (43%) patients, respectively. Viruses were parainfluenza (35%), respiratory syncytial virus (28%), influenza (22%), adenovirus (7%), human metapneumovirus (4%), coronavirus (2%), and rhinovirus (2%). Three patients relapsed with their primary disease before day 100 and were excluded. The overall mortality for the remaining 51 patients was 10% (allogeneic = 4, autologous = 1). All 5 deaths were directly attributable to RVI and all 5 deaths occurred in patients with a lower respiratory tract infection. The remaining patients were followed for a median of 4.3 years (range, 1.4 to 11.8) and no chronic pulmonary complications were observed. A clear seasonal pattern for contracting RVI was evident with 65% of total RVI occurring between October and March (35 of 427 versus 19 of 417, P = .03). Given the significant mortality from RVI and the challenges in preventing them, choosing the time to start HSCT, whenever possible, may help prevent RVI and improve outcomes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
