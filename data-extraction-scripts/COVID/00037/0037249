Glycan arrays are a new technology that has enabled the high-sensitivity and rapid analysis carbohydrate–protein interaction and contribute to significant advances in glycomics. Glycan arrays use a minute amount of materials and can be used for high-throughput profiling and quantitative analysis and provide information for the development of carbohydrate-based vaccines and new drug discovery.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
