However, further investigation is needed to determine whether phosphorylation of the N protein could affect PRRSV virulence in piglets. In this study, we confirmed that the mutations could impair PRRSV replication ability in porcine primary macrophages (PAMs) as they did in Marc-145 cells. The animal experiments suggested that the pathogenicity of the mutated virus (A105-120) was significantly reduced compared with parent strain (XH-GD). Our results suggested that the phosphorylation of the N protein contributes to virus replication and virulence. This study is the first to identify a specific modification involved in PRRSV pathogenicity. Mutation of PTMs sites is also a novel way to attenuate PRRSV virulence. The mutations could be a marker in a vaccine. In conclusion, our study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV pathogenicity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
