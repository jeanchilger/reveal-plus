So far, more than 140 cycloartane triterpene glycosides have been isolated from Cimicifuga spp.. The aim of this review was to summarize all 9, 19-cyclolanostane triterpenoid glycosides based on the available relevant scientific literatures from 2000 to 2014. Biological studies of cycloartane triterpene glycosides from Cimicifuga spp. are also discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
