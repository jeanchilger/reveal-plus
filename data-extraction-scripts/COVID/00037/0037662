Proteins are a common target for POC analyses and the detection of protein markers typically involves immunoassays aimed at detecting different groups of proteins such as tumor markers, inflammation proteins, and cardiac markers; but other techniques can also be used to analyze plasma proteins. In the case of nucleic acids, hybridization and amplification strategies can be used to record electromagnetic or electric signals. These techniques allow for the identification of specific viral or bacterial infections as well as specific cancers. In this review, we consider some of the latest advances in the analysis of specific nucleic acid and protein biomarkers, taking into account their trend toward miniaturization and paying special attention to the technology that can be implemented in future applications, such as lab-on-a-chip instruments.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
