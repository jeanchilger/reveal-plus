<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-02-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Diarrhea</TITLE><BODY>Diarrheal diseases continue to contribute significant morbidity and mortality to pediatric populations in developed and developing countries around the world. The prevalence of diarrheal illness across cultures is inversely proportional to the availability of public sanitation, clean water supply, and adequate medical care. As such, it is not surprising that the incidence of diarrheal disease is much higher in developing societies and can approach 10 episodes per child per year in children under 5 years of age. In these areas, aggregate mortality can reach 3–5 million deaths per year. In the US and other developed nations, both the incidence (1–2 episodes per year) and mortality (approximately 400–500 deaths annually) are considerably decreased. Nonetheless, the burdens placed on Western healthcare systems by pediatric diarrheal disease are considerable and approximately 20% of all pediatric ambulatory visits and 10% of all inpatient hospital admissions in children under 3 years of age are for the evaluation and treatment of these disorders and their complications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
