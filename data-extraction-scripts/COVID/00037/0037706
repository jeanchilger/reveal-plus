<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-07-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Control, Management, and Prevention of Bovine Respiratory Disease in Dairy Calves and Cows</TITLE><BODY>Incidence rates for bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in dairy cattle have remained essentially unchanged over the last 20 years. Dairy calves are more commonly affected than adult animals, with BRD being the principal cause of death in weaned dairy calves. The lack of progress in controlling respiratory disease demonstrates that there continues to be significant room for improvement in controlling this multifactorial syndrome, and that dairy producers need assistance in applying evolving husbandry practices to improve the health of dairy cattle. Therefore, it seems prudent to focus the management strategies on preventing disease through sound management of the transition period, along with sound vaccination and biosecurity programs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
