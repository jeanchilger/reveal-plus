Risk factors include personnal characteristics (age, socio-economic status, disease denial, depression, medical features associated with increased severity), environment factors as life events and exposure to specific (allergens) and as non-specific factors (viral or microbial infections, passive smoking, air polluants) and the health care system (care delivery, quality of medical management).
