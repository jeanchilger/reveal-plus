(Haplosclerida, Petrosiidae) and the other an unidentified haplosclerid sponge, both contained the unusual steroidal sulfamate esters, haplosamates A (1) and B (2), the structures of which were determined by interpretation of spectral data. Haplosamates A (1) and B (2) inhibit HIV-1 integrase with IC50's of 50μg/mL and 15μg/mL, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
