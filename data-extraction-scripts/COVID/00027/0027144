Ready-to-eat (RTE) products factories have begun to further segregate or ‘zone’ production areas for food safety or hygiene reasons. A series of higher hygiene zones have been created to protect the product from microbiological cross-contamination events after it has been heat treated or decontaminated. There has also been the recognition that non-microbiological hazards, particularly allergens, and label declaration issues such as ‘suitable for vegetarians’, ‘organic’, ‘does not contain GM materials’ or ‘Kosher/Halal’ have to be controlled by segregating them from other product ingredients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
