The approach is featured with a continuity equation being explicitly solved for water vapor, which allows comprehensively considering the effects of inhomogeneous humidity field on droplets evaporation and movement. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations based on the approach achieved a satisfactory agreement with the theoretical models reported in the literature. The results demonstrated that the evaporation-generated vapor and super-saturated wet air exhaled from the respiratory tracks forms a “vapor plume” in front of the respiratory track opening, which, despite the short life time, significantly impedes the evaporation of the droplets captured in it. The study also revealed that due to the droplet size reduction induced by evaporation, both the number density of airborne droplets and mass concentration of inhalable pathogens remarkably increased, which can result in a higher risk of infection. Parametric studies were finally conducted to evaluate the factors affecting droplet evaporation. Summary The study demonstrated the importance of considering inhomogeneous humidity field when modelling the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets. The multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian model presented in this study provides a comprehensive approach to address different influential factors in a wide parametric range, which will enhance the assessment of the health risks associated with droplet exposure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
