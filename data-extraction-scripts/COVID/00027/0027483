All ten volunteers rapidly developed substantial titres of rabies antibody, and eight of the ten had T lymphocytes that were immunologically stimulated by HDCS rabies-virus antigen. Postexposure treatment with 0·8 ml of HDCS vaccine given at 4 i.d. sites completely protected fourteen rabbits from death by street virus. The results suggest that in developing countries patients could be protected with small volumes of potent tissue-culture vaccine administered intradermally shortly after exposure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
