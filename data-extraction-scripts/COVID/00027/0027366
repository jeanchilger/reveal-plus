Specific staining using ifa and pap was successful only in sections of fresh frozen tissue and formalin fixed/formol sublimate postfixed tissues respectively. A range of tissues was then taken at post mortem examination from a puppy which had been experimentally infected with cpv. Upon comparison, pap staining gave high resolution, a permanent preparation and clear intracellular localisation of antigen. ifa resulted in less defined localisation of antigen but the technique was simpler and more easily controlled.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
