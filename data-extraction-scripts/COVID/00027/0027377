The infection was more severe in the athymic rats and caused considerable clinical disease. Virus was shown to replicate in the bronchial epithelium and persisted in athymic rats for the duration of the experiment (32 days). The characteristic changes of necrosis of the bronchial epithelium and subsequent hyperplasia also persisted in this group and was accompanied by quite extensive interstitial pneumonitis. The virus failed to evoke an antibody response in the athymic rats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
