<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1991-10-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Diarrhées néonatales à rotavirus résultats d'une enquête conduite dans des unités de néonatologie</TITLE><BODY>Summary A retrospective survey was performed among 24 neonatal care units. In the years 1989–1990, outbreaks of rotavirus infections were observed in 58 % and recurred in 46 % of neonatal care units. Six units presented with 3 or more outbreaks. Rapid diagnosis methods always were available and were usually agglutination latex test or ELISA test. Measures were suggested to limit the spread of the outbreaks : wearing of a gown ascribed to each infant (20/0) ; isolation of infected neonates (16/3) ; cohorting infected neonates (11/7) ; systematic stool examination for rotavirus identification in all neonates (9/10) ; use of gloves for handling contaminated stools (6/13). Stopping admissions and systematic stools examination in staff members were never applied.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
