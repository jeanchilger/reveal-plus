<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1983-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Normal and clinical haematology in the yak (Bos grunniens)</TITLE><BODY>Haematological examinations have been carried out on 21 clinically normal male and female adult yaks (Bos grunniens). Animals sedated with xylazine had significantly lower red cell counts, haemoglobin levels and packed cell volumes, fewer lymphocytes and higher monocyte counts than those bled while manually restrained. There were few significant sex differences. Several animals had eosinophilia associated with asymptomatic intestinal nematode infection. Haematological reference values were calculated for clinically normal, xylazine sedated and manually restrained yaks. These were used to identify haematological changes in 10 animals with various abnormal clinical signs. It was concluded that blood counts can provide valuable diagnostic information in this species.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
