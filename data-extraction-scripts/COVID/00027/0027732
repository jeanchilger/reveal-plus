The aim of this study was to assess the effect of combined use of oral Azithromycin (AZT) plus Echinacea compared to exclusive use of AZT in children with recurrent tonsillitis. Material and methods A prospective comparative study including three groups of children with recurrent tonsillitis. Group 1: (100 patients) had no prophylactic treatment. Group 2 (100 patients) received [60 mg/kg] prophylactic dose of AZT divided as (10 mg/kg/day) over 6 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Group 3 (100 patients) received AZT as in group 2 plus commercially available Echinacea in a dose of 5 ml oral suspension; 3 times daily for 10 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of tonsillitis symptoms were assessed and compared in different groups. Results Group 2 and group 3 had significant less number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of assessed symptoms during 6 months of prophylactic treatment with significant better results in group 3 (i.e. AZT plus Echinacea) compared to group 2 (I.e. AZT alone). However; there was no significant difference in patients with any prophylaxis. Conclusion The combined use of Echinacea with Azithromycin produced favorable outcome than Azithromycin alone in pediatric patients with recurrent tonsillitis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
