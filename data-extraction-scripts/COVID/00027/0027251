<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Treatment With Convalescent Plasma for Critically Ill Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection</TITLE><BODY>As of March 24, 2020, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for 379,661 infection cases with 16,428 deaths globally, and the number is still increasing rapidly. Herein, we present four critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received supportive care and convalescent plasma. Although all four patients (including a pregnant woman) recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection eventually, randomized trials are needed to eliminate the effect of other treatments and investigate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
