<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Update on antimicrobial resistance: mechanisms, methods and practice</TITLE><BODY>Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem for hospitals and the community. This interactive session developed for trainees will explore current antimicrobial resistance issues pertinent to the laboratory, including detection and importance in determining mechanisms of resistance, screening, therapeutic implications and consequences for infection control. Four trainees will present illustrative cases of antimicrobial resistance (MRSA, VRE, multi-resistant Gram-negative organisms and Candida) followed by expert panel discussion. Dr John Merlino will deliver an update on hot topics in antimicrobial susceptibility testing and resistance in a ‘show and tell session’. Finally trainees and the expert panel will have an opportunity to discuss prepared questions on antimicrobial resistance issues.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
