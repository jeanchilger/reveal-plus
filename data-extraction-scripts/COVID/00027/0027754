Objective To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Method Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from 20 January to 10 February 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. Results The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into four themes. Firstly, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Secondly, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Thirdly, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. Conclusions During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
