(1) A variety of viruses causes transient or prolonged immunosuppression by infecting lymphoreticular tissues and interacting with components of the immune system. (2) In persistent viral infections effective immune responses may result in tissue damage. The mechanisms involved are T-cell-mediated destruction of infected cells and delayed-type hypersensitivity. (3) In a number of viral diseases pathogenic immune complexes are formed when antibodies are produced and react with viral antigen molecules persisting in the host. The selected examples of immune dysfunction are the focus of this review.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
