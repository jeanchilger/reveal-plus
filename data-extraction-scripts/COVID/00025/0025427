The predominant symptom was frequency in 40 patients, urge incontinence in 31 and stress incontinence in 66. There appeared to be a correlation between urge incontinence and a hyperreflexic cystometrogram but no correlation was noted between either frequency or stress incontinence and the cystometrogram profile. The urethral pressure profile showed a correlation between stress incontinence and the lowest profile measurements. Frequency and urge incontinence had similar profile measurements except for maximum urethral planimetry. Electromyography showed that the external urethral sphincter had a different finding than the levator ani or the external anal sphincters in all 3 groups of female patients. The external urethral sphincter had a higher percentage of denervation than the other 2 muscles, especially in the stress incontinence group.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
