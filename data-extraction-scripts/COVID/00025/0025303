The types of vaccine in current use are described, together with some of the problems encountered such as interference by maternal antibodies, and usage in species other than dogs.

Nevertheless there is scope for some improvement in vaccine efficacy and recent developments in genetic recombinant methods are described.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
