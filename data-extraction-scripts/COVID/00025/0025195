At the same time, the two fathers and the other subjects of the cattery remained asymptomatic of F.I.P. The clinical observations, supported by electrophoretic data, suggest the possibility of a direct transmission of the disease by the mother to her offspring, either by the transplacentary pathway (epigenetic transmission) or via the milk.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
