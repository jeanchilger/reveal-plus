In vitro translation of P mRNA in a wheat germ system resulted in the synthesis of two polypeptides of M r 35,000 Comparison of the deduced P protein sequence with that of the known mammalian pneumoviruses revealed overall amino acid identities ranging from 31 to 34.5%, suggesting a distant relationship. However, there was a much higher identity (63.2–68.4%) in a region of 57 residues, which included a heptad repeat sequence.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
