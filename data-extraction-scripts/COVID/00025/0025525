Some are useful for the detection of traces of viral antigens but are more complicated and timeconsuming than others. Simple techniques of immunofluorescence and negative stain electron microscopy are used for the rapid detection of viruses in human adenoviral, herpetic, rubella, molluscum contagiosum, and vaccinial infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
