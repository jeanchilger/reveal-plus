Similar studies, as well as studies on animal viruses, were carried out in Australia by Burnet and his colleagues. One result of their extensive studies, which were summarized in great detail, was the conclusion that, with respect to their interaction with antibody, bacterial and animal viruses were basically different. Specifically, the difference resided in the stability of the union of virus and antibody, whereas bacterial viruses formed stable complexes, animal viruses formed complexes that tended to dissociate readily. The introduction of animal cell cultures as host systems greatly aided in the study of animal viruses, with respect to fewer and more readily controlled variables, and by the use of the plaque assay in enhanced quantitative reliability. In 1956, Dulbecco et al. described the interaction of two animal viruses with their respective antibodies. The results of these studies led these investigators to conclude, among other things, that animal viruses, at least the two they studied, reacted with antibodies to form complexes that did not dissociate spontaneously. This interpretation was challenged by Fazekas de St. Groth and Reid. As more animal virus-antibody systems were studied by many investigators, there seemed to be a greater accord for irreversible, rather than reversible, interaction. For this reason, in this chapter it is assumed that there are no differences between bacterial viruses, as one category, and animal viruses, as a separate category, concerning their interaction with antibodies. Rather, differences, when they exist, are considered to be related to the viruses per se. Although this chapter is intended to survey the neutralization of animal viruses, occasional reference is made to the studies on bacterial viruses when these studies are pertinent and illuminating to the topic at hand.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
