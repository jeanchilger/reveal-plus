To extend the data base on potential health effects from coal liquefaction materials, we performed a study with solvent refined coal (SRC)-II heavy distillate (HD). Fischer-344 rats were exposed for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 5 or 13 weeks to an aerosol of HD (boiling range, 288 to 454°C) at concentrations of 0.69, 0.14, 0.03, or 0.0 mg/liter of air for the high, middle, low, and control groups, respectively. Survival through 13 weeks of exposure was greater than 90% for all groups; body weights for exposed animals were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. significant increases in liver weights and decreases in thymus and ovary weights were observed for treated animals compared with controls. There were also significant treatment-related decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, volume of packed red blood cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and total white blood cells. After 5 weeks of exposure serum cholesterol concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner for both sexes and serum triglyceride amounts decreased for males but not for females. After 13 weeks of exposure, high-dose animals had significant increases in cholesterol (males only), triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT; males) and significant decreases in albumin, SGPT (females), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Examination of bone-marrow preparations from exposed animals demonstrated consistent decreases in the degree of cellularity, suggesting that this organ is a target for HD. Microscopic evaluation of organ sections indicated exposure-related changes for nasal mucosa, pulmonary macrophages, thymus, liver, kidney, bone marrow, ovaries, and cecum. Results from this study indicated dose-dependent increases in the severity of the lesions observed, with few effects in the low-exposure group that were attributable to the exposure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
