Based on sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions, a generalized structural model for the ATP-binding core is proposed. It is suggested that all these proteins constitute a superfamily of helicases (or helicase subunits) involved in NTP-dependent duplex unwinding during DNA and RNA replication and recombination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
