In order to determine the effects of multiple vaccination schedules on the immune system of racing greyhounds, three litters of greyhound pups raised in laboratory conditions were divided into two groups and subjected to either a maximum or a minimum vaccination schedule. Blood samples were collected biweekly for 6 months beginning at 2 weeks of age and analyzed to establish ‘baseline’ values for the lymphatic system of greyhounds. Lymphocyte transformation, total and differential leukocyte counts, and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cellular immunity. Humoral immunity was evaluated using serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests. Proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A) was higher for the maximum vaccination groups. The frequency distribution of circulating CD4 and IgG labeled lymphocytes was higher in the minimum vaccination groups. A significant treatment by time interaction in CD4, IgG, and IgM labeled cells was observed. This interaction, however, was not significant at any point in time for CD4 and IgG labeled cells. The percentage of lymphocytes expressing surface IgM was significantly higher in the minimum vaccination groups at 10 and 14 weeks of age. No significant differences were detected in humoral immunity between the maximum and minimum groups of each litter. Results of this study indicate that maximum vaccination schedules do not appear to be more effective or more immunosuppressive than minimum vaccination schedules.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
