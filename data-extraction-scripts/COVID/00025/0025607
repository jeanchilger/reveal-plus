Currently, this TCM could treat various clinical inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and psoriasis, however, the bioactive components of Qing Dai are unknown clearly. Aim of the study To isolate and identify the anti-IL-17A components of Qing Dai. Materials and methods Silica, RP-18 gels, and size exclusion resin were used for column chromatography to isolate the pure compounds. The structures of isolates were elucidated by NMR, MS, UV, IR spectra, and optical rotation. IL-17A protein and gene expressions were also evaluated in the Th17 cell model and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. Results Two indole alkaloids, including one new indigodole D and cephalandole B, were isolated from Qing Dai. Indigodole D could inhibit IL-17A protein production during the Th17 polarization (EC50: 2.16 μg/mL) or after the polarization (EC50: 5.99 μg/mL) without cytotoxicity toward Th17 cells. Cephalandole B did not inhibit the IL-17A protein secretion. Nevertheless, both isolates notably inhibited IL-17A gene expression, especially cephalandole B, in a dose-dependent manner in Jukat cells with IL-17A luciferase reporter. Conclusions Indole alkaloids, indigodoles A, C, D, tryptanthrin, and indirubin could contribute to anti-IL 17A properties of Qing Dai. The possible biogenetic mechanisms of above-mentioned indoles were also speculated in this investigation for further promising anti-IL-17 lead drugs development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
