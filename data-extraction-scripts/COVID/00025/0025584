Trials carried out by us with a modified live and inactivated canine parvovirus vaccine in newborn puppies provide evidence of the immune capacity of these puppies. With regard to transfer of immunity from mother to offspring, there is a role for transplacental and colostral immunity. Examples of passive protection of young animals against different infections include passive protection of kittens against the feline immunodeficiency virus. However, passive immunity, though very useful at an early age, varies in duration and makes implementation of standard vaccination schedules difficult. Other experiments demonstrate that, under certain conditions, it is possible to overcome residual maternally-derived antibodies and to induce post-vaccinal immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
