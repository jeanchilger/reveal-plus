In an effort to obtain further information on the characteristics of this virus, we have begun to sequence the viral RNA genome and to map the virion structural protein genes. A sequence of 1064 nucleotides, which represents the 3′ terminal end of the genome, was obtained from LDV cDNA clones. A 3′ noncoding region of 80 nucleotides followed by two complete open reading frames (ORFs) were found within this sequence. The two ORFs were in different reading frames and overlapped each other by 11 nucleotides. One ORF encoded a protein of 170 amino acids and the other ORF, located adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region of the viral genome, encoded a 114 amino acid protein. Thirty-three N-terminal residues were sequenced directly from purified LDV capsid protein, Vpi, and this amino acid sequence mapped to the ORF adjacent to the 3′ noncoding region. The presence of overlapping ORFs and the 3′ terminal map position of Vpi indicate that LDV differs significantly from the prototype alpha togaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
