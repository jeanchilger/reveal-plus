However, pathogens in the patient's nasal and oral cavities may be dispersed by forced air. This study aimed to investigate the risk of pathogen dispersal during high-flow nasal therapy. Liquid and bacterial dispersal were assessed via in-vitro experimental set-ups using a manikin. Thickened water or fresh yeast solution mimicked saliva and nasal mucus secretions. Dispersal was limited to the proximal area of the face and nasal cannula, suggesting that high-flow nasal therapy does not increase the risk of droplet and contact infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
