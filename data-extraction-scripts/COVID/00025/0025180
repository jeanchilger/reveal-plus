<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1982-07-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Recombination in RNA</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The aphthovirus genome consists of a single molecule of single-stranded RNA that encodes all the virus-induced proteins. We isolated recombinant aphthoviruses from cells simultaneously infected with temperature-sensitive mutants of two different subtype strains. Analysis of the proteins induced by 16 independently generated recombinants revealed two types of protein pattern, which were consistent with single genetic crossovers on the 5′ side and 3′ side, respectively, of the central P34-coding region. Recombinants invariably inherited all four coat proteins from the same parent, and novel recombinant proteins were not observed. RNAase T1 fingerprints of virus RNA, prepared from representatives of each recombinant type, confirmed the approximate crossover sites that had been deduced from the inheritance of proteins. These fingerprints provide molecular evidence of recombination at the level of RNA and demonstrate the potential of RNA recombination for producing genetic diversity among picornaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
