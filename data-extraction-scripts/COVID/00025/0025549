Yet obtaining the desired level and specificity of expression of an introduced gene remains highly problematic. One solution could be to couple expression of a transgene to that of an appropriate intact genomic locus. The identification and functional characterization of RNA sequences known as internal ribosome entry sites now offer the possibility of achieving precise control of transgene expression through the generation of dicistronic fusion mRNAs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
