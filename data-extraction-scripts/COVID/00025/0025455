The data is related to those obtained with other flaviviruses, which are assumed to have a conserved structural organization, and compare the characteristics of flavivirus fusion to those of other enveloped viruses. Fusion proteins from several different virus families, including Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Retroviridae, and Filoviridae have been shown to exhibit striking structural similarities; they all use a common mechanism for inducing membrane fusion, and the same general model applies to all of these cases. The flavivirus genome is a positive-stranded RNA molecule consisting of a single, long open reading frame of more than 10,000 nucleotides flanked by noncoding regions at the 5′ and 3′ ends. The fusion properties of flaviviruses have been investigated using several different assay systems, including virus-induced cell–cell fusion and virus–liposome fusion. All of these studies indicate that flaviviruses require an acidic pH for fusion, consistent with their proposed mode of entry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
