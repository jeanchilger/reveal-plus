In 11 cases, chronic inflammatory lesions were present in various tissues including, most commonly, the intestine, brain and lung. Extensive inflammation in the intestinal wall was present in seven of the cats. No particular bacterial organisms were demonstrated in these inflammatory lesions. A range of changes was present in the lymph nodes, including hyperplasia, atrophy or a mixed pattern. Erythrophagocytosis was a consistent feature. The changes resembled those reported in human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as a result of infection with human immunodeficiency virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
