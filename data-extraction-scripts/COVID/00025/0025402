The aim of this study was to determine whether cytokines that can be expressed by mucosal cells have an effect on the rotavirus susceptibility of cultured human enterocytes. METHODS: Caco-2 and HT-29 cells were pretreated with various cytokines before challenge with rotavirus. RESULTS: Interleukin (IL)-1, interferon (IFN)-alpha, and IFN-gamma pretreatment led to a dose-dependent resistance to rotavirus infection. Maximum effects occurred after 72 hours of pretreatment, whereas no detectable inhibition occurred with <12 hours of pretreatment. Liposomal transfection of single-shelled and double-shelled rotavirus particles bypassed the block to rotavirus replication in IFN-gamma- and IL-1- treated but not IFN-alpha-treated cells. Binding studies with purified, metabolically labeled rotavirus showed no significant difference among IFN-gamma- and IFN-alpha-treated and control Caco-2 cells. Viral entry into Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited by IFN-gamma and IL-1 but not IFN-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma induce rotavirus resistance by different mechanisms, suggesting that cytokines play a role in host defense against viral agents by changing the phenotype of intestinal epithelial cells.
