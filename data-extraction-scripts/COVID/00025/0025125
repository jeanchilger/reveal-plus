Serum antibody levels were not significantly different between the four groups. Differences in the frequency and levels of CSF antibodies between the four groups were observed. Control patients had serum CSF antibody ratios from 2.0 to 3.0 (log) with an average of 2.5 corresponding to a 320-fold difference between serum and CSF antibody levels. MS patients had ratios from 1.1 to 2.1 with an average of 1.6. The average was 2.0 for the ON patients. The average for the OND patients was similar to the controls. The altered serum CSF ratios for several viruses within an individual patient was similar. These results suggest that nonspecific immunostimulation is responsible for the increased levels of CSF virus antibodies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
