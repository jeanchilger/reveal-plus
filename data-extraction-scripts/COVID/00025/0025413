The feeding regimen was colostrum once daily, day 4 to 14; milk replacer once daily, day 15 to 28; and calf starter ad libitum, day 4 to 84. Bull calves were fed for 42 days and heifers for 84 days. Calves fed acidified colostrum refused more feed and were less efficient from day 4 to 14 than calves fed buffered colostrum. Bulls were more sensitive to acidified colostrum than heifers. Starter intake, total dry matter intake, and average daily gains were similar for all calves during days 4 to 84. Rumen fluid from calves fed diets with sodium bicarbonate was higher in acetate and lower in propionate and lactate than that from calves fed diets without sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate improved intake of acidified colostrum during the first 2 or 3 days of feeding but had no other effect on gain or feed intake.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
