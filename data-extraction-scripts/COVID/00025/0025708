Part II: diagnostic approach and differential diagnosis</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Results of a neurological examination usually permit localisation of a vestibular disorder to either the central or peripheral parts of the vestibular system. Many different disorders located in the same part of the vestibular system will produce similar clinical signs. Therefore, additional diagnostic tests beyond a neurological examination are required in order to make an accurate diagnosis. The objectives of this review are to outline a diagnostic approach for disorders affecting the feline vestibular system, and to summarise the clinically important features of frequently diagnosed diseases affecting the vestibular system of cats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
