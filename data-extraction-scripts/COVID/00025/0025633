<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1995-09-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Infections of the Newborn</TITLE><BODY>Viral infections of the newborn result in significant morbidity and mortality each year. The fetus and newborn are particularly wlnerable to viral infection. The range of expression may vary from no clinical disease to devastating illness and infection occurring before, during, or after birth. Nursing management is determined by the specific viral infection, the severity of the illness, and the unique conditions of the newborn and his/her family. Promising new therapies are on the horizon that may lessen the severity of viral disease. Until such time, the major thrusts of management of neonatal viral disease are prevention of infection and supportive care for the acutely ill newborn.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
