The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has affected the normal diagnosis and treatment services in oral medical institutions across the country. Delay of non-emergency dental service will have a potential impact on the experience, cognition, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with oral diseases. Through literature review, this paper reviewed the oral psychosomatic diseases closely related to patients' psychological state, such as oral mucosal disease, temporomandibular joint disease, bruxism, periodontal disease and so on. It was believed that these patients might be more susceptible to the impact of stress events, and dental specialists should pay more attention to them. At the same time, this paper analyzes the possible psychological stress symptoms of patients with different oral diseases, and puts forward suggestions for remote consultation and emergency treatment of dentists. From the perspective of social role, dentists not only played the role of expert in dental home professional guidance, but also played the role of psychological counseling for patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
