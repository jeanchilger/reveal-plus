Only minimal equipment is required. Patient group Any cat with clinical signs attributable to a reduced red blood cell mass that is affecting oxygen transport (as a result of reduced packed cell volume or acute blood loss) is a potential candidate for a transfusion. Clinical challenges Although the principles of transfusion medicine are not complicated, there can be fatal consequences if certain steps are omitted. Diagnostics Blood typing kits and blood filters are readily available from veterinary wholesalers, laboratories and blood banking services. Evidence base Over the past three decades, a substantial body of clinical research and reports has built up covering feline blood types and transfusion medicine. This article draws on that research to provide clinical guidance aimed at all veterinarians in feline or small animal practice who either currently practise transfusion medicine or plan to do so.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
