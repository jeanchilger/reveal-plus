The past year has seen considerable advances in our understanding of the contribution of epitope spreading to the chronic pathogenesis of experimental T-cell-mediated and antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. Most significantly, conclusive functional evidence for a major role for epitope spreading in the chronic pathogenesis of murine relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a CD4+ T-cell-mediated model of multiple sclerosis, was forthcoming.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
