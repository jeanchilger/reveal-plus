The results showed that most compounds exhibited high inhibitory activities against APN and low activities against MMP-2. Within this series, two compounds 5q and 5s (IC50 =5.3 and 5.1μM) showed similar inhibitory activities compared with bestatin (IC50 =3.8μM), which could be used as novel lead compounds for the future APN inhibitors development as anticancer agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
