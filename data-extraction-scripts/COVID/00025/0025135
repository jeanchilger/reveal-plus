Male F-344 rats were exposed to 175 ppm DMA 6 hr per day for 1, 2, 4, or 9 days or 2 years. Gross changes in nasal structure were recorded, effects of DMA on the mucociliary apparatus were assessed using video analysis, and tissues were evaluated for histopathology. In vitro nasal mucociliary flow patterns, mucus flow rates, and ciliary activity were studied and recorded for video motion analysis. There were distinct and generally consistent differences in the shape of the naso-, maxillo-, and ethmoid turbinates between young and old animals. Acute and chronic DMA exposures resulted in erosion of the anterior margins of the naso- and maxillo-turbinates and fenestration of the adjacent septum. Ciliastasis and mucostasis were observed only on the anteromedial aspect of the maxilloturbinate. In the chronically exposed rats, mucociliary activity was present in areas adjacent to erosions of the turbinates and septum. Abnormal mucus flow patterns, including altered or reversed direction of flow and “whirlpool-like” formation, were observed in all treated rats, but were more severe following chronic exposure. There was a good correlation between the distribution of responses as assessed by histopathology and abnormal mucociliary function at all time points. In conclusion, the mucociliary apparatus continues to function in the nasal passages of rats having localized destruction of nasal epithelium, induced by DMA exposure, and this clearance system responds to alterations of nasal structure by modification of mucus flow patterns.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
