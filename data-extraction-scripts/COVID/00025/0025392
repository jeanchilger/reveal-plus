<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1985-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Special Features of Asthma in Children</TITLE><BODY>Asthma in children has many special features which deserve consideration. This disease is probably underdiagnosed and is often undertreated. Vague, persistent respiratory symptoms, especially chronic cough, may often be due to asthma. Chronic bronchitis is extremely rare in the pediatric patient and is a manifestation of reactive airway disease or cystic fibrosis. The absolute severity, the extent of the disease, responses to treatment, and long-term course should be evaluated by repeated pulmonary function tests. Fortunately, asthma responds well to pharmacologic and supportive therapy, and it is important to approach its management as that of a chronic rather than episodic illness. Therapy should include comprehensive, closely supervised drug therapy, health education, and a program of selfmanagement. Asthma usually starts before youngsters enter school, and the majority get better as they get older. Nevertheless, many children with moderate or severe asthma will continue to be troubled by intermittent or chronic airway obstruction into adulthood, and they require long-term, anticipatory treatment programs. Comprehensive care will optimize the quality of life for the affected children and their families, and it will minimize the discomfort and restrictions to which some of them have been subjected unnecessarily. Asthma in childhood, especially when not well controlled, may constitute a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adulthood; however, this is as yet only suspected and not proved. 47&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
