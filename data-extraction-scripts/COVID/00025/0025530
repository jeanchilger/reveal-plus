<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1998-07-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chronic diarrhoea among HIV-infected adult patients in Nairobi, Kenya</TITLE><BODY>Objectives Chronic diarrhoea and wasting are well recognized features of AIDS in Africa. However, because of resource constraints few ocmprehensive aetiological studies have conducted in sub-Saharan Africa which have included a broad range of microbiological investigations. We undertook a prospective cross-sectional study of adult patients admitted to a government hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, to determine possible bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic and viral causes of diarrhoca; to consider which may be treatable; and to relate microbiological findings to clinical outcome. Methods Stool specimens from 75 consecutive HIV-seropositive patients with chronic diarrhoca admitted to a Nairobi hospital were subjected to microbiological investigation and results were compared with clinical findings and outcome. Stool samples were cultured for bacteria and mycobacteria and underwent light and electron microscopy; lawns of Escherichica coli were probed for pathogenic types and aliquots were tested for the presence of Clostridium difficile cytotoxin. Blood cultures for mycobacteria and other bacterial pathogens were performed as clinically indicated. Results Thirty-nine (52%) patients yielded putative pathogens, the most common being Cryptosporidium sp. (17%), Salmonella typhimurium (13%), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (13%). Of 41 patients investigated for pathogenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli and diffusely adherent E. coli were each found in four patients. Thirty-one (41%) patients died. Detection of cryptosporidium cysts was the single most significant predictor of death (X2 = 5.2, P<0.05). Many patients did not improve (21; 285) or self-discharged whilst still sick (5; 7%) but five (7%) were diagnosed ante mortem with tuberculosis and treated and a further 13 (17%) showed improvement by time of discharge. Conclusions HIV-infected patients with chronic diarrhoea in Nairobi have a poor outcome overall, and even with extensive investigation a putative pathogen was identified in only just over half the patients. The most important step is to exclude tuberculosis: and the most useful investigation appears to be Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Other potentially treatable Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, S. typhimurium, Shigella sp. and adherent E. coli were, however, common but require culture facilities which are not widely accessible for definitive identification. Further studies focussing on simple ways to identify sub-groups of patients with treatable infections are warranted.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
