The ranges widely used in clinical practice reflect these inappropriate sources. The data presented here were obtained using modern methods of analysis on blood samples from healthy, conventionally managed sows from six breeding herds of known disease status in eastern England, and thus represent appropriate ranges for this class of swine. The values differ from earlier reports principally in higher values for total bilirubin, creatine kinase, and more particularly of total plasma and serum proteins. The latter are shown to be due to higher immunoglobulin concentrations than those previously reported.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
