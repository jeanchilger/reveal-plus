Although the sites for insertion were initially chosen empirically, the determination of the three-dimensional structures of a number of carrier macromolecules has enabled structure-based insertional mutagenesis to be used increasingly. Furthermore, it is now feasible to determine the structure of an inserted sequence as presented in a heterologous environment, making it possible to correlate the detailed structure of a peptide with its immunological properties.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
