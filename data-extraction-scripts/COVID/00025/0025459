The inclusion of all these viruses in the family Togaviridae was largely based on the similarities in morphological and physical–chemical properties of these viruses, and in the sizes and polarities of their genomes. In the intervening years, considerable new information on the replication strategies of these viruses and the structure and organization of their genomes has become available that has led to the reclassification or suggestions for reclassification of some of them. The replication strategy of EAV resembles that of the coronaviruses, involving a 3'-coterminal nested set of mRNAs. Therefore, EAV has been suggested to be included in a virus superfamily, along with coronaviruses and toroviruses. Recent evidence indicates that LDV not only resembles EAV in morphology, virion and genome size, and number and size of their structural proteins, but also in genome organization and replication via a 3'-coterminal set of mRNAs. SHFV, although not fully characterized, exhibits properties resembling those of LDV and EAV, and the recent evidence suggest that it may possess the same genome organization as these viruses. The three viruses may, therefore, represent a new family of positive-strand RNA viruses and are reviewed together in this chapter. In this chapter, emphasis is on the recent information concerning their molecular properties and pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo and on the host immune responses to infections by these viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
