The intestinal epithelium represents a good model system in which the glycosylation process can be studied. The intestinal epithelium is composed of two basic epithelial cell types: the absorptive enterocyte and the mucus-producing goblet cell. Gastrointestinal epithelial renewal ensues through the processes of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. This renewal occurs in discrete proliferative zones along the gastrointestinal tract. In the small intestine, this proliferative zone is restricted to the base of the crypts, whereas in the large intestine it is less restrictive, occurring in the basal two thirds of the crypt. A longitudinal section along the crypt-to-surface axis, cells in various degrees of differentiation is observed, providing a unique in vivo system in which to investigate differentiation-related glycosylation events. The glycoconjugate repertoire displayed by a given cell reflects its endogenous expression of glycosyltransferases. The role played by terminal oligosaccharide structures in cell–cell recognition phenomena and the expression of glycosyltransferases occupy a key position in the post-translational processing of glycoconjugates and thus influence cellular function.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
