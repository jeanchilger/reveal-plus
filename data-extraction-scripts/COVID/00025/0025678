A survey is presented of recent advances in the study of the influences that Sias have as bulky hydrophilic and electronegatively charged monosaccharides on animal cells and on their interaction with microorganisms. Some highlights are: sialylation leads to increased anti-inflammatory activity of IgG antibodies, facilitates the escape of microorganisms from the host's immune system, and in polymeric form is involved in the regulation of embryogenesis and neuronal growth and function. The role of siglecs in immunoregulation, the dynamics of lymphocyte binding to selectins and the interactions of toxins, viruses, and other microorganisms with the host's Sia are now better understood. N-Glycolylneuraminic acid from food is antigenic in man and seems to have pathogenic potential. Sia O-acetylation mediated by various eukaryotic and prokaryotic O-acetyltransferases modulates the affinity of these monosaccharides to mammalian and microbial receptors and hinders apoptosis. The functionally versatile O-acetylated ganglioside GD3 is an onco-fetal antigen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
