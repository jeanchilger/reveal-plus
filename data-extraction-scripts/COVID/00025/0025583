However, information regarding such changes in animal disease is limited. In canine parvovirus infected puppies we measured the levels of acute phase proteins and changes in leukocyte phenotypes and cell trafficking by flow cytometry. These parameters correlated with conventional assessment of clinical disease in a vaccine efficacy study. Seropositive (CPV-2) 6-week-old puppies given three doses of a CPV-2 containing vaccine developed significant antibody titers and remained healthy after experimental infection with CPV-2b. Unvaccinated controls developed clinical signs and shed virus. Importantly, acute phase proteins became elevated, and lymphopenia, neutropenia and modulation of neutrophil-CD4 were detected in controls but not in vaccinates.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
