Physical condition and IgG status were examined during the first 30 d of life. Calves were fed the dried colostrum powder (group A), pooled colostrum (group C), or both (groups B and D) 2h after birth. Calves fed 85g of the dried colostrum powder dissolved in 3kg of whole milk (group A) had significantly lower IgG concentrations 24h after birth than calves of the other groups. Administration of 85g of the dried colostrum powder plus 3kg of colostrum (group C) did not lead to significantly higher IgG concentrations 24h after birth than did administration of 3kg of colostrum alone (group B). Calves fed 85g of the dried colostrum powder plus 1.5kg of colostrum (group D) had an IgG concentration at 24h of age that was not significantly different from that of calves given 3kg of colostrum (group B). Morbidity and mortality rates were not significantly different among groups. One calf died in each of groups A and B; no losses occurred in groups C and D. Body weight increase was not significantly different among groups.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
