The phosphorylated regions consist largely of repeating tetrapeptides with two basic residues flanking Ser-Pro residues (‘SPKK’ motifs) and are predicted to have β-turn secondary structures. Alteration of the charge and structure of the SPKK sites may play a role in the unusually dense DNA packaging of the mature sperm chromatin. The motif resembles the target site of cell-cycle-associated cdc2 kinases and is found in several other proteins whose nucleic acid affinities may be altered during the cell cycle.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
