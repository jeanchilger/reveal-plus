African green monkey is a widely used non-human primate model in biomedical investigations. In this study, total RNAs were extracted from stool samples of 10 African green monkeys with diarrhea. High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize viromes. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to determine the full genome sequences. Great viral diversity was observed. The dominant viruses were enteroviruses and picobirnaviruses. Six enterovirus genomes and a picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence were characterized. Five enteroviruses belonged to two putative new genotypes of species Enterovirus J. One enterovirus belonged to EV-A92. The picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence had the highest nucleotide similarity (93.48%) with human picobirnavirus isolate GPBV6C2. The present study helped to identify the potential zoonotic viruses in African green monkeys. Further investigations are required to elucidate their pathogenic roles in animals and humans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
