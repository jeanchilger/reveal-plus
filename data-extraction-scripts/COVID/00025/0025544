The aim of this study was to answer the question, whether this activity originates from APN-gene expression. The total cellular activities (Ala-pNA hydrolysis) of lymphoid cell lines are up to 15 times higher than that of normal lymphocytes. Despite weak or lacking CD13 surface expression all lymphoid cell lines tested contain APNmRNA as quantified by competitive RT-PCR as well as low enzymatic activity in their particulate fractions. By isoelectric focusing two enzyme species with isoelectric points of 5.4 or between 3.5 to 4.8, respectively, were detected. To investigate whether these activities result from APN-gene we established transfectants lacking cellular APN expression of the CD13-positive histiocytic cell line U937 and the CD13-negative T cell line H9. Studies on these transfectants proved (I) that the main neutral aminopeptidase activity expressed in lymphoid cells is definitively not related to APN and (II) that APN is also expressed in lymphoid cells, although on a low level only.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
