The virus was isolated from a severe outbreak of respiratory disease in East Anglia. Haemagglutinin and neuraminidase characterization showed the virus to be very similar to H3N2 strains circulating in the human population during the years 1972–1975, and to H3N2 strains recently isolated from pigs in Belgium and France. A serological survey showed antibodies to the virus to be present in 31% of pigs tested, and reactors were detected on 43% of farms sampled.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
