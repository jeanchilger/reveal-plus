Purpose To investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging coronavirus 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans. Materials and Methods Fifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women, 16-76 years old) with 2019-nCoV pneumonia confirmed with the positive new coronavirus nucleic acid antibody underwent thin-section CT. The imaging findings, clinical and laboratory data were evaluated. Results Fifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of the endemic center Wuhan contact. Fever (49/51, 96%) and cough (24/51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37/51, 73%), neutrophil count (44/51, 86.3%) and normal (17/51, 35.3%) or reduced (33/51, 64.7%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground grass opacity (GGO) in 39/51 (77%) patients, GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38/51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30/51 (59%) and pure consolidation in 28/51 (55%) patients. 44/51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41/51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44/51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 or more days from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 or fewer days (431/712 lesions vs. 129/612 lesions, p < 0.001). Patients more than 50 years old had more consolidated lung lesions than those 50 years or younger (212/470 vs. 198/854, p < 0.001). Follow up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in 7 (54%) patients and progression in 4 (31%) patients. Conclusions Patients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground grass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure are highly suspected of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
