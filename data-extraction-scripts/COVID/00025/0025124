The agent has been attenuated by serial passage in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. When attenuated virus is inoculated in 8-week-old C3HeJ mice a myelopathy of delayed onset with prominent demyelination of lateral and anterior columns occurs. The DA virus is believed to be related to the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (TME) viruses because of the similar clinical and pathological conditions which it causes, and because neutralization tests indicate shared antigens between it and GD7, a TME virus. This paper reports electron-microscopic studies of BHK-21 cells infected with DA virus. The cells were prepared 24 and 48 hr after inoculation. Cytopathic effects were observed and infected cells contained plaques consisting of numerous 25 nm virus particles in crystalline array. The virions were exclusively intracytoplasmic and were morphologically indistinguishable from human poliomyelitis virus. These observations appear to establish DA as a picorna virus, related to the TME virus group. The chronic myelopathy caused by DA may prove relevant to chronic demyelinative myelopathies in man, such as multiple sclerosis, and also to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
