This technology allows the use of RNA virus replication machinery to express heterologous sequences. Both positive-strand and negative-strand animal RNA viruses have been engineered to produce chimeric viruses expressing protective epitopes from other pathogens and for transient expression of heterologous sequences.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
