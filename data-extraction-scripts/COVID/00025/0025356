This article discusses ways in which molecular medicine can inform public health policy and clinical practice in the management of asthma. It focuses on the recognition that asthma is an inflammatory disorder, and that the public health burden of the disease can be reduced by identifying environmental factors that may trigger asthma in genetically susceptible individuals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
