The assay was as sensitive as the fluorescent focus test for quantification of virus in clinical material and was less labor-intensive. Viral infectivity could be inactivated with formalin prior to performance of the enzyme immunoassay. Specificity of the reaction product was shown by neutralization of infectivity using a hyperimmune rabbit antiserum to murine parvovirus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
