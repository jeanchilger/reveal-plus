<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1984-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Respiratory Viruses and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae Infections at the Time of the Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Otitis Media</TITLE><BODY>The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether or not patients with chronic otitis media are infected with viruses or Mycoplasma at the time of sudden increase in otorrhea. From 26 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, sera were collected at the time of sudden increase in otorrhea and three to four weeks later. These paired sera were examined for antibody titer to respiratory viruses (21 species) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Of them, influenza B virus and RSV infections were demonstrated in four and two cases, respectively. Examinations showed no infection in 10 control cases without acute exacerbation. In 36 cases of acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, attempts were made to isolate viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae from the pharynx and otorrhea. Consequently, influenza B virus was detected in pharyngeal mucous scrapings in two cases and RSV in one. The probability of respiratory virus infection leading to acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media appears to be lower than that provoking acute otitis media in children and infants. However, the present data suggest that the development of respiratory virus infection in patients with chronic otitis media may cause an increase in the otorrhea, eventually resulting in an acute exacerbation of inflammation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
