A pattern of emergence of higher molecular weight forms was observed. By using a cleavable cross-linker, aminopeptidase N was shown to cross-link both to itself and to its breakdown products as well as to dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Using this technique it was possible to identify three of the breakdown products as 45 kDa, 66 kDa and 95 kDa peptides. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was used to define the precise cleavage points for the bovine renal aminopeptidase N breakdown products. The short amino acid sequences obtained show strong sequence similarity with the human intestinal and rat kidney aminopeptidase N.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
