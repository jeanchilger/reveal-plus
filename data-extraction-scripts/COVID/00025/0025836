In this study, a fundamental knowledge gap question is to be resolved by evaluating the differences in biological and pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with the two prior major COV epidemics, SARS and MERS coronaviruses. METHODS: The genome composition, nucleotides analysis, codon usage indices, relative synonymous codons usage (RESU) and effective number of codons (ENc) were analysed in the four structural genes; Spike (S), Envelope (E), membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes, and two of the most important non-structural genes comprising RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, Beta-CoV from pangolins, bat SARS, MERS and SARS CoVs. These genes include Spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), Envelop(E) and membrane (M) genes. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 prefers pyrimidine rich codons to purines. Most high-frequency codons were ending with A or T, while the low frequency and rare codons were ending with G or C. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins showed 5-20 lower ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs. This implies higher codon bias and higher gene expression efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. SARS-CoV-2 encoded the highest number of over biased and negatively biased codons. Pangolin Beta-CoV showed little differences with SARS-CoV-2 ENc values, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoV. CONCLUSION: Extreme bias and lower ENc values of SARS-CoV-2, especially in Spike, Envelope and Mpro genes, are suggestive for higher gene expression efficiency, compared with SARS, bat SARS and MERS CoVs.
