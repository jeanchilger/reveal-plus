The resulting compound was then employed for the enzymatic glycosylation of the C-3′ hydroxyl of chemically prepared glycosylated amino acid 10 using recombinant rat α-(2→3)-O-sialyltransferase expressed in Spodooptera frugiperda [EC 2.4.99.4] to give, after deprotection of the N α-benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz)-protecting group of serine, target compound 1. The N α-CBz-protected intermediate 11 can be employed for the synthesis of glycolipopeptides for immunization purposes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
