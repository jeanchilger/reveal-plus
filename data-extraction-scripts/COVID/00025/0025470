Rubella virus infection is systemic in nature and the accompanying symptoms are generally benign, the most pronounced being a mild rash of short duration. The most common complication of rubella virus infection is transient joint involvement such as polyarthralgia and arthritis. The primary health impact of rubella virus is that it is a teratogenic agent. The vaccination strategy is aimed at elimination of rubella and includes both universal vaccination of infants at 15 months of age with the trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and specific targeting with the rubella vaccine of seronegative women planning pregnancy and seronegative adults who could come in contact with women of childbearing age, although it is recommended that any individual over the age of 12 months without evidence of natural infection or vaccination be vaccinated. Medically, the current challenge posed by rubella virus is to achieve complete vaccination coverage to prevent resurgences.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
