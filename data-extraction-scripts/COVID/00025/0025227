Possible antiviral mechanisms of macrophages are defined and referred to as intrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to serve as a non-permissive barrier between the virus and susceptible cells and extrinsic, i.e. the ability of macrophages to affect the virus or virus replication in surrounding cells. Most studies on the role of macrophages in natural resistance to virus infections have been performed in animal models. An interesting aspect of many viral infections in animals is the finding of a genetically determined variation in natural resistance. Because of the availability of numerous inbred and congenic strains most studies on genetically determined resistance have been performed in mice. The classical examples are resistance to flaviviruses and susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus, both of which are inherited as dominant, monogenic traits. With these viruses macrophage intrinsic restriction of virus replication has been found to express at the cellular level the genetics of resistance/susceptibility seen in the intact animal. Other examples, where macrophages have been implicated in genetically determined resistance include herpes simplex virus and influenza virus. The involvement of macrophages in natural resistance to these viruses is discussed in relation to other putative resistance determinants like interferon production and sensitivity and natural killer cell activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
