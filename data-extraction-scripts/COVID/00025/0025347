Intracellular budding is facilitated by targeting of the viral glycoproteins to this organelle. It is likely that these viral glycoproteins are retained in the Golgi by the same means as are endogenous Golgi proteins. Consequently, the study of Golgi-specific viral proteins has provided important clues to the nature of Golgi retention signals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
