Selection of hybrid cell colonies was based on the ratio of bovine and murine chromosomes, the presence of cell-surface immunoglobulins and growth characteristics. First-generation fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the number of antigen-specific antibody-producing clones generated. Hybrid cell colonies that initially secreted antibodies were selected from first-generation heteromyelomas to function as second-generation fusion partners. Although fusion efficiencies for both generations did not differ, the second-generation heteromyelomas yielded a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones. Fusion of heteromyelomas with either lymph node cells or splenocytes indicated that fusion with lymph node cells results in a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones, whereas fusion efficiency was found to be higher with splenocytes. The optimal time intervals between the final booster injection and fusion were found to be 4 days for splenocytes and 7 days for lymph node cells. Finally, the characterization of bovine monoclonal antibodies against bovine rotavirus and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin and their neutralizing capacities in vitro are described.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
