C. parvum oocysts were identified by using the Ziehl-Neelsen modified technique in 109 (19.7%) bovines ranging from 3 days old to adults. Positive animals were found in 19 (63.3%) farms. As much as 44.4% of calves aged 3–4 days were infected, but infection rates peaked at 6–15 days of age (76.7%). Nevertheless, prevalence was also high in weaning calves aged 1.5–4 months (14%), fattening calves and heifers 4–24 months old (7.7%) and adults (17.8%). Diarrhoea was recorded in 78.6% of suckling and 29.4% of weanling calves infected by C. parvum, but it was only found to be statistically associated with infection in suckling calves (P < 0.01). All calves shedding moderate or many oocysts had diarrhoea, whereas asymptomatic infection was always correlated with few oocysts in faeces. Cryptosporidial infections were always asymptomatic in bovines older than 4 months. Giardia cysts were identified in 65 bovines (11.7%) from 16 (53.3%) of the farms surveyed. Infection rates were significantly higher in suckling (14.1%) and weanling calves (38%) than in bovines older than 4 months (2.2%) (P < 0.001). Diarrhoea was recorded in 45.5% of suckling and 10.9% of weanling calves infected by Giardia, but it was not found to be statistically associated with infection. In fact, infection rates were higher in non-diarrhoeic than in diarrhoeic calves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
