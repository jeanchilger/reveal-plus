The rationale for current and potential therapies for the common cold are reviewed in the context of current concepts of the pathogenesis of these illnesses. Data sources and study selection A MEDLINE literature search was done using the search terms common cold, rhinovirus, and viral respiratory infection. The search was restricted to the English language. Articles were selected for review if the title and/or abstract suggested the content was relevant to the subject of this review. The bibliographies of selected articles were used as a source of additional literature. Results Recent studies suggest that the host response to the virus is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of the common cold. Inflammatory mediators, especially the pro-inflammatory cytokines, appear to be an important component of this response and present an attractive target for new interventions for common cold therapies. Currently available treatments for the common cold have limited efficacy against specific symptoms. These therapies should be selected to treat the specific symptoms that are perceived to be the most bothersome by the patient.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
