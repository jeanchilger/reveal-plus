<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-03-29</DATELINE><TITLE>The Battle Between Influenza and the Innate Immune Response in the Human Respiratory Tract</TITLE><BODY>Influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory tract. Infection is normally confined to the upper respiratory tract but certain viral strains have evolved the ability to infect the lower respiratory tract, including the alveoli, leading to inflammation and a disease pattern of diffuse alveolar damage. Factors leading to this sequence of events are novel influenza strains, or strains that have viral proteins, in particular the NS1 protein that allow it to escape the innate immune system. There are three main barriers that prevent infection of pneumocytes - mucin, host defence lectins and cells such as macrophages. Viruses have developed strategies such as neuraminidase and glycosylation patterns that allow this evasion. Though there has been much investment in antiviral drugs, it is proposed that more attention should be directed towards developing or utilizing compounds that enhance the ability of the innate immune system to combat viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
