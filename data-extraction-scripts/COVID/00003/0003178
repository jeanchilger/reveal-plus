The indole ring is planar in both molecules [maximum deviations = 0.021 (3) and −0.020 (3) Å for the N atom] while the cyclo­hexene ring has adopts a sofa conformation. In the crystal, mol­ecules are linked by pairs of N—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming dimers with R (1) (2)(6) ring motifs. These dimers are connected by N—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, generating chains along [110]. A C—H⋯O contact occurs between the independent mol­ecules.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
