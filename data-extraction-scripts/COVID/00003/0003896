CypA suppresses T-cell activation through cyclosporine (Cs) complexation and is required for effective HIV-1 replication in host cells. We show that CypA is acetylated in diverse human cell lines and use a synthetically evolved acetyl-lysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA) pair to produce recombinant acetylated CypA in E. coli. We determine atomic resolution structures of acetylated CypA and its complexes with Cs and HIV-1 capsid. Acetylation dramatically inhibits CypA catalysis of cis to trans isomerisation and stabilises cis rather than trans forms of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, CypA acetylation antagonizes the immunosuppressive effects of Cs, by inhibiting the sequential steps of Cs binding and calcineurin inhibition. Our results reveal that acetylation regulates key functions of CypA in immunity and viral infection and provide a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation modulates interactions to regulate cell function.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
