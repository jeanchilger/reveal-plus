<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-03-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Fit for the future? The place of global health in the UK's postgraduate medical training: a review</TITLE><BODY>OBJECTIVES: That health is now global is increasingly accepted. However, a ‘mismatch between present professional competencies and the requirements of an increasingly interdependent world’ has been identified. Postgraduate training should take account of the increasingly global nature of health; this paper examines the extent to which they currently do. DESIGN: Trainees across 11 medical specialties reviewed the content of their postgraduate curriculum. SETTING: Not relevant. PARTCIPANTS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Competencies were coded as ‘UK’ (statement only relevant to UK work), ‘global’ (statement with an explicit reference to aspects of health outside the UK) or generic (relevant both to the UK and international settings). RESULTS: Six of the 11 curricula reviewed contained global health competencies. These covered the global burden or determinants of disease and appropriate policy responses. Only one College required trainees to ‘be aware of the World Health Organization’, or ‘know the local, national and international structures for health care’. These cross-cutting competencies have applicability to all specialties. All 11 curricula contained generic competencies where a global health perspective and/or experience could be advantageous, e.g. caring for migrant or culturally different patients. CONCLUSION: Trainees in all specialties should achieve a minimum requirement of global health awareness. This can be achieved through a small number of common competencies that are consistent across core curricula. These should lead on from equivalent undergraduate competencies. Addressing the current gap in the global health content of postgraduate medical curricula will ensure that the UK has health professionals that are trained to meet the health challenges of the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
