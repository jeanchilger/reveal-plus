The many antiviral functions of the IFN-I include direct suppression of viral replication and activation of the immune response against viruses. In addition to their antiviral effects, IFN-I are also protective against several extracellular bacterial infections, in part, by promoting the induction of TNF-α and nitric oxide. In contrast, there is a negative effect of IFN-I on host resistance during chronic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and acute infections with intracellular bacteria. In the case of LCMV, chronic IFN-I signaling induces adaptive immune system suppression. Blockade of IFN-I signaling removes the suppression and allows CD4 T-cell- and IFN-γ-mediated resolution of the infection. During acute intracellular bacterial infection, IFN-I suppress innate immunity by at least two defined mechanisms. During Francisella infection, IFN-I prevent IL-17 upregulation on γδ T cells and neutrophil recruitment. Following Listeria infection, IFN-I promote the cell death of macrophages and lymphocytes, which leads to innate immune suppression. These divergent findings for the role of IFN-I on pathogen control emphasize the complexity of the interferons system and force more mechanistic evaluation of its role in pathogenesis. This review evaluates IFN-I during infection with an emphasis on work carried out IFN-I-receptor-deficient mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
