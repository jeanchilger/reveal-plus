The expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in various DC subsets and haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which generate DCs, remain to be fully identified. Here we examine miRNomes of mouse bone marrow HSCs, immature DCs, mature DCs and IL-10/NO-producing regulatory DCs by deep sequencing. We identify numerous stage-specific miRNAs and histone modification in HSCs and DCs at different differentiation stages. miR-30b, significantly upregulated via a TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated epigenetic pathway in regulatory DCs, can target Notch1 to promote IL-10 and NO production, suggesting that miR-30b is a negative regulator of immune response. We also identify miRNomes of in vivo counterparts of mature DCs and regulatory DCs and systematically compare them with DCs cultured in vitro. These results provide a resource for studying roles of miRNAs in stem cell biology, development and functional regulation of DC subsets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
