It enabled comprehensive dissection of a complex, multigene phenotype through rapid derivation of a large number of chimeric viruses and construction of a mutant library directly from a virus pool. The versatility of the approach described here expands the applicability of diverse genetic approaches to study these viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
