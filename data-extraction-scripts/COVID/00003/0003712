<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-09-20</DATELINE><TITLE>Role of Natural Killer and Gamma-Delta T cells in West Nile Virus Infection</TITLE><BODY>Natural Killer (NK) cells and Gamma-delta T cells are both innate lymphocytes that respond rapidly and non-specifically to viral infection and other pathogens. They are also known to form a unique link between innate and adaptive immunity. Although they have similar immune features and effector functions, accumulating evidence in mice and humans suggest these two cell types have distinct roles in the control of infection by West Nile virus (WNV), a re-emerging pathogen that has caused fatal encephalitis in North America over the past decade. This review will discuss recent studies on these two cell types in protective immunity and viral pathogenesis during WNV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
