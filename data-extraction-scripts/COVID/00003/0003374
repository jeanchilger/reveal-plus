They are generated through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and release of interluminal vesicles. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that macrophages infected with Mycobacterium release exosomes that promote activation of both innate and acquired immune responses; however, the components present on exosomes inducing these host responses were not defined. The present study used LC-MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFP) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFP-treated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present on exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis-infected cells. The exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could promote macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as activation of naïve T cells in vivo. These results suggest that exosomes containing M. tuberculosis antigens may be alternative approach to developing a tuberculosis vaccine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
