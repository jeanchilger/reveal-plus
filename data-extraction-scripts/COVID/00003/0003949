However, because of their capacity to suppress antigen presenting cells (APC), T and B cells, Tregs could also inhibit protective immune responses to viruses and vaccines. Several viruses have been shown to exploit Tregs to evade immune response. By modulating APC and in particular by weakening the functions of dendritic cells such as their ability to secrete polarizing cytokines and expression of co-stimulatory molecules, viruses could support differentiation and expansion of Tregs. Of note, as a proof of concept, depletion of Tregs significantly enhanced the protective immune response to viruses and vaccines suggesting that Tregs are viable targets to enhance immunogenicity of vaccines. As Treg depletion or inhibition of their functions could lead to deleterious autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, any Treg-based approach for vaccination should not aim at depletion of Tregs and inhibition of their functions should be transient. Recent studies have targeted the interaction between CCR4 expressed on Tregs and its ligands CCL22 and CCL17 to inhibit transiently the recruitment of Tregs at the site of immunization. Importantly, use of CCR4 antagonists as ‘molecular adjuvants’ in vivo in experimental models, amplified cellular and humoral immune responses when injected in combination with various vaccine antigens. The significant adjuvant activity observed in diverse models without noticeable side effects provided strong evidence that CCR4 is a sustainable target for rational adjuvant design.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
