A novel canine parvovirus (CPV) was detected from the giant panda in China. RESULTS: Nucleotide and phylogenetic analysis of the capsid protein VP2 gene classified the CPV as a new CPV-2a type. Substitution of Gln for Arg at the conserved 370 residue in CPV presents an unusual variation in the new CPV-2a amino acid sequence of the giant panda and is further evidence for the continuing evolution of the virus. CONCLUSIONS: These findings extend the knowledge on CPV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
