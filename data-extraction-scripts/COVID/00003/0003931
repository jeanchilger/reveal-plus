By using a monoclonal antibody (1H8) that neutralizes HCV in vitro, we have demonstrated here that 1H8 recognized an epitope mapped between residues A524 and W529 of the E2 protein. We also found that the epitope residues A524, P525, Y527 and W529 were crucial for antibody binding, while the residues T526, Y527 and W529 within the same epitope engaged in the interaction with the host entry factor CD81. Furthermore, we detected “1H8-like” antibodies, defined as those with amino acid-specificity similar to 1H8, in the plasma of patients with chronic HCV infection. The time course study of plasma samples from Patient H, a well-characterized case of post-transfusion hepatitis C, showed that “1H8-like” antibodies could be detected in a sample collected almost two years after the initial infection, thus confirming the immunogenicity of this epitope in vivo. The characterization of this neutralization epitope with a function in host entry factor CD81 interaction should enhance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of HCV infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
