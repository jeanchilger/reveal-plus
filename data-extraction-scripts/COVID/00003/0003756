Respiratory viruses have been shown to modulate the host response to gain a replication advantage through a variety of mechanisms. Viruses are parasites and must co-opt host genes for replication, and must interface with host cellular machinery to achieve an optimal balance between viral and cellular gene expression. Host cells have numerous strategies to resist infection, replication and virus spread, and only recently are we beginning to understand the network and pathways affected. The following is a short review article covering some of the studies associated with the Tripp laboratory that have addressed how respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) operates at the virus-host interface to affects immune outcome and disease pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
