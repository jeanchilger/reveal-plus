<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013</DATELINE><TITLE>Revisiting Public Health Challenges in the New Millennium</TITLE><BODY>Positive Health of the communities could only be brought out through the interrelationship between conventional health sector and other development sectors. It was a dream that came true when World Health Organization (WHO) accepted Primary Health Care (PHC) as the major tool to achieve its proposed goal of Health For All (HFA) by 2000 A.D., but we could not succeed as expected.
