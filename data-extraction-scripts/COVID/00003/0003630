However, recent studies reveal additional roles for CD4(+) T cells, some of which are independent of other lymphocytes, and indicate that memory cells are more effective in most functions than naïve CD4 T cells. Here, we review the full spectrum of antiviral functions of CD4(+) T cells, including their helper activities, innate immune induction, and direct anti-viral roles, and suggest how these functions are integrated to provide highly protective responses against viral pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
