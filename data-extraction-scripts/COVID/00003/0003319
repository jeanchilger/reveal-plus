Several components of the host immune responses have been shown to contribute to the UGT pathology following genital chlamydial infection. We have shown recently that CD8(+) T cells induce the chlamydial UGT pathology via the production of TNF-α. However, those studies did not determine whether the pathology is mediated by bystander or antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. In this study, we compared chlamydial clearance and UGT pathology in OT-1 transgenic mice and the corresponding C57BL/6J wild type mice following primary intravaginal C. muridarum infection. All CD8(+) T cells in the OT-1 mice respond only to the Ova 257–264 peptide and are incapable of responding to other antigenic epitopes including those of Chlamydia. OT-1 mice displayed vaginal chlamydial clearance comparable to the wild type animals. However, both oviduct and uterine horn pathology were minimal in the OT-1 mice compared to the high degree of pathology observed in the wild type animals. These results strongly suggest that Chlamydia-specific, not bystander, CD8(+) T cells mediate the UGT pathological sequelae following genital chlamydial infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
