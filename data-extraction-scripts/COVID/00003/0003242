In two recent papers by the Owen and Goldberg labs, the binding mode of dilysine motifs to the coatomer of the COPI coat has been analysed. Collectively, their findings suggest that the dilysine motif containing cargo proteins may stabilize coat complexes on membranes and enhance the chance for coat polymerization and vesicle budding.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
