However, there is little research that has rigorously evaluated the association between domain swapping and protein folding/unfolding. Here, we examined a kinetic model in which domain swapping occurred via the denatured state produced by the complete unfolding of proteins. The relationships between swapping kinetics and folding/unfolding thermodynamics were established, which were further adopted as criteria to show that the proposed mechanism dominates in three representative proteins: Cyanovirin-N (CV-N), the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV main protease (M(pro)-C), and a single mutant of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx_W28A(ox)).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
