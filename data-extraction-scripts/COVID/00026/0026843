<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 5 Integrated Polymerase Chain Reaction Technologies (Sample-to-Answer Technologies)</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The tools available for both infectious disease diagnostics and human identity testing have benefitted from major technological advances in the automation of nucleic acid purification, amplification, and detection methods. The seamless integration of these processes into a fully automated microscale format has led to the development of rapid, user-friendly sample-to-answer assay systems. The application of these systems for human identity testing allows for DNA profiles to be generated in a field-forward environment where they can be used to generate investigative leads in crimes or other actionable intelligence. When used for infectious disease diagnostics, the sensitivity and specificity of these assay systems meets or exceeds that of more conventional strategies for the detection of respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and sexually transmitted pathogens. The anticipated medical benefits of this technology include shorter hospital stays, the elimination of unnecessary or ineffectual treatment, improved patient outcomes, and an overall quantifiable reduction in healthcare costs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
