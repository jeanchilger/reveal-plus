<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1998-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter 24 The Prevalence of Common Respiratory Viruses in Human Lungs</TITLE><BODY>Publisher Summary Viral infections probably initiate a large percentage of childhood and adult asthmatic attacks based on a history of preceding 'cold', high rates of viral isolation during attacks with lower rates of isolation during symptom-free intervals, and peaks of hospital admissions for asthma coinciding with viral epidemics. Although PCR technology provides a much more sensitive and specific method for detecting viral nucleic acids, its role in diagnosing active viral infection has been only partially explored. The PCR screening procedure for nine common respiratory viruses was performed on lung tissue obtained from both asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. Six additional cases (four lifetime non-smokers and two with remote minimal smoking histories) were added to control for the fact that both the asthmatics and non-asthmatics smoked heavily. Data from two viruses (the adenovirus and RSV) are used to discuss the possible role of latent and persistent viral infection in the pathogenesis of chronic lung inflammation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
