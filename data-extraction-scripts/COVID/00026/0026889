Monoclonal antibodies are protein molecules made in the laboratory from hybridoma cells by recombinant DNA technology. Important advances have been made over the past decade to improve some critical points, such as safety and efficacy of the first generation of therapeutic antibodies. This type of molecules presents a significant challenge from the pharmaceutical point of view due to their characteristics, such as molecular size, stability, and solubility. In this chapter we have attempted to identify the major issues associated with therapeutic approaches, formulating drawbacks and delivering antibody drugs, particularly focused on the challenges and opportunities that these present for the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
