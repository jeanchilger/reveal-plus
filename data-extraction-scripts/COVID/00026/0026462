Continual refinement of animal toxicity and carcinogenesis studies, however, can be an effective means of reducing the numbers of animals used and conserving time and resources without compromising scientific quality. We must continue to strive to find species and strains that can metabolize chemicals similar to humans, are small enough to be housed in large numbers, and have low prevalence of spontaneous lesions with sufficient life span to express the toxic and carcinogenic potential of chemicals. Adequate care of animals with control of variables such as light, temperature, diet, bedding, diseases, and genetic characters of laboratory animals will decrease the variability. Humane considerations and euthanasia of animals with large masses and other conditions interfering with eating and drinking, major injuries and ulcers related to husbandry and treatment, and diseases indicating pain and suffering will help not only to alleviate further pain and distress but also to facilitate collection of tissues without secondary complications for detection of chemical treatment-related lesions. Limiting the duration of studies to decrease the variability due to ageassociated changes will also refine long-term studies. Other considerations for refinement of carcinogenesis studies include selection of the most sensitive sex of one or more species for evaluation of selected chemicals in a class where toxic and carcinogenic potential of other representative chemicals are known. Genetically engineered animal models with known oncogenes may reduce the duration and increase the sensitivity of carcinogenesis studies with a reduction in the use of animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
