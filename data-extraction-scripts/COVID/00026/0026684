C6 Cells</TITLE><BODY>Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the production systems of adenoviral vectors. Particular attention is paid to the generation and use of complementation cell lines that carry the El genes and emphasizes on the PER.C6 cell line, which was developed to prevent generation of replication-competent adenovirus (RCA) during propagation of El-deleted adenoviral vectors. Further, safety issues with respect to the use of the cell line for making clinical grade material are also addressed in this chapter. The PER.C6 cell line is the best substrate for the production of adenoviral vectors for gene therapy or vaccines. PER.C6 permits extensive analysis for adventitial agents and other safety concerns and thus is less hazardous than short-lived primary cell cultures for which testing must be repeated for each newly established culture.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
