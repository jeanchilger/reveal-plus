<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1983-08-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Problems of calf rearing in connection with their mortality and optimal growth: A review</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Protection of calves against enteric and respiratory disorders is dependent on the passive immunity that the calf has received, its innate resistance to infection, the burden of infection in the environment and the nutrition of the calf. Superimposed on these, are the effects of management and physical environment. The plane of nutrition required for dairy heifers during rearing depends on the age at first calving, and for meat animals depends on the carcass weight and fat deposition required at a particular slaughter date in relation to time of birth.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
