For Norwalk gastroenteritis and hepatitis A, the IEM technique enabled not only the definitive visualization and identification for the first time of virus-like particles from individuals with these diseases but also enabled researchers to demonstrate for the first time the serological association of an identifiable virus-like agent with each of these diseases. The chapter also explains that a mixture of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and anti-TMV rabbit serum resulted in aggregation of the virus particles, whereas by contrast, such aggregation did not occur when the virus reacted with a control normal rabbit serum. T. F. Anderson and W. M. Stanley demonstrated the electron-microscopic specificity of the reaction by observing the lack of such reactivity between TMV and rabbit antiserum to tomato bushy stunt virus; and between tomato bushy stunt virus and anti-TMV rabbit serum.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
