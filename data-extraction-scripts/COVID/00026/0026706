<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1987-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>CHAPTER 35 Viral Diseases by Domestic Animal Species</TITLE><BODY>Publisher Summary This chapter presents tables that list the most important diseases and syndromes caused by viruses in each domestic animal species with their etiological associations. This listing is neither meant to substitute for a textbook of veterinary medicine or infectious diseases nor is it intended to be used for differential diagnosis, where viral and other etiologies must be considered together. Such a tabulation inevitably involves oversimplification, but page numbers have been provided to direct the reader to appropriate pages for detailed coverage of each of these viral infections. In these tables, each disease is ascribed to a measure of its importance as viewed from the perspective of veterinary medicine in countries with modern agricultural practices. There is an arbitrary element in relation to the group of diseases to which certain infections are allocated. For example, most generalized skin diseases result from generalized blood-borne infection but they have been listed as skin diseases. Where viruses cause generalized signs and also signs of particular importance in some system or in the newborn, they have been entered in both categories.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
