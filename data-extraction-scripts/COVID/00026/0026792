This chapter concentrates on the pathology of the more common pathogens of the laboratory rat. Based on serologic surveys, parvo viruses are some of the most common viral pathogens in wild and laboratory rat. In general, there are three main serogroups, including Rat virus (RV), H-1 virus, and Ratparvovirus (RPV). Both RPV and RV are tropic for many of the same tissues and they both may result in a persistent infection. However, RPV is antigenically and genetically distinct from RV, and it apparently does not cause clinical signs or lesions in infant rats. M. pulmonis causes natural disease in rats and mice. The infection in young rats is usually clinically silent. In older rats, there are nonspecific clinical signs such as snuffling, chromodacryorrhea, and face and ear rubbing. Several bacteria of the genus Streptococcus can cause clinical disease in rats. All of the streptococci of concern in rats are Gram-positive cocci, and are catalase-negative, nonfermentative, and generally nonmotile. Cilia-associated respiratory bacillus has been identified in rats. In rats, infection is usually asymptomatic although nonspecific clinical signs, such as weight loss and dyspnea, may be observed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
