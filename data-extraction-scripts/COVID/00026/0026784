Remarkable progress has been accomplished over the past 20 years with the discovery of many potent bioactive foldamers originating from diverse backbones and targeting a whole spectrum of bio(macro)molecules such as membranes, protein surfaces, and nucleic acids. These current achievements, future opportunities, and key challenges that remain are discussed in this article.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
