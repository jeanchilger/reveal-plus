Of the 150 heifer calves originally enrolled in the field trial, 115 calves (59 treatment, 56 controls) were followed to about 6 months of age, during which time their weights were measured. After weights were adjusted for several potential risk factors and effect modifiers, calves fed pasteurized colostrum and pasteurized waste milk were 3.7 kg heavier at 180 days of age than those fed nonpasteurized colostrum and nonpasteurized milk.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
