Equally important to the success of the study and to the well-being and protection of study participants is the assurance that safe clinical environments are provided for the care of research participants. This chapter describes approaches to managing clinical care and clinical research quality in clinical research, as well as the application of established health care-based clinical quality methods and tools to the complex processes of clinical research. Techniques for identifying clinical risks, tools for collecting data about the quality of clinical care processes, and strategies for measuring the participants' perceptions of the research process are discussed in detail.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
