<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1996-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>5 Electron microscopy</TITLE><BODY>Publisher Summary This chapter provides a detailed methodology of some of the basic electron microscopic (EM) techniques currently used in virology. The chapter is subdivided into four sections: a general introduction, negative staining procedures, thin sectioning procedures, and briefly scanning EM. Following a brief discussion of the principles, each technique is given in the chapter in sufficient detail to be followed as a recipe. Modifications are included within the methodology. The size, equipment, and organization of an EM unit naturally vary according to the service requirements. There are some basic requirements that need to be considered. Immune electron microscopy is the visualization of the reaction between an antigen, usually a virus, and an antibody and is used to detect either component of this reaction. Thus, the technique has been used to detect serological responses to such viruses as Norwalk virus. The technique has assisted in the identification of rubella virus and been diagnostically used to identify Hepatitis B virus infection and viruses associated with diarrhea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
