Efficient movement of germ plasm worldwide requires established cryobanks. Embryo cryopreservation has become a routinely successful technology for many species and efforts to develop usable cryobanks for many target species are ongoing. Recommended regulations for the movement of embryos from nontraditional (i.e. other than domestic livestock) species are nonexistent. Efforts are underway to establish domestic and international handling guidelines and to recommend suitable quarantine conditions to facilitate embryo importation. Further basic research on specific zona pellucida-pathogen interactions is encouraged to support embryo movement efforts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
