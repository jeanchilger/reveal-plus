Cats vaccinated with TGE virus developed neutralizing antibodies against TGE virus and low titer antibody against FIP virus detected by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique but were not protected against a virulent FIP virus challenge. Baby pigs and pregnant gilts vaccinated with FIP virus did not develop detectable antibodies to TGE virus. Nevertheless, it appeared that vaccination of swine with FIP virus conferred some immunity against TGE virus infection. Seventeen-day-old pigs vaccinated with two doses of FIP virus had a 67% survival rate following a virulent TGE virus challenge, and 75% of the 3-day-old pigs suckling either FIP or TGE-virus-vaccinated gilts survived virulent TGE virus infection in contrast to 0% survival of baby pigs suckling unvaccinated gilts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
