Smallpox was eradicated using a mass vaccination strategy. The major successes in controlling infectious diseases in the 1950s and 1960s was followed by two coincident global trends that would have an impact on the dramatic reemergence of infectious diseases in the waning years of the twentieth century. The first was the redirection of the resources that were once used to control infectious diseases to other public health priorities, such as the “War on Cancer” in the early 1970s. The perception that infectious diseases were no longer a problem led to decreased resources, widespread deterioration of public health infrastructure to deal with infectious diseases, and complacency among government and public health officials as well as the public. This trend included medical education with a deemphasis on preventive medicine and a strong focus on curative medicine in medical schools. The second trend was the sharply increasing and unprecedented rate of human population growth following World War II that has continued for 60 years. Increasing human numbers have been a principal factor leading to uncontrolled urbanization, changes in agriculture, land use and animal husbandry practices, and accelerated globalization, all of which have been major and interrelated drivers of the reemergence of epidemic infectious diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
