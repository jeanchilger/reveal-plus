<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-03-06</DATELINE><TITLE>GS-5734 and its parent nucleoside analog inhibit Filo-, Pneumo-, and Paramyxoviruses</TITLE><BODY>GS-5734 is a monophosphate prodrug of an adenosine nucleoside analog that showed therapeutic efficacy in a non-human primate model of Ebola virus infection. It has been administered under compassionate use to two Ebola patients, both of whom survived, and is currently in Phase 2 clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease. Here we report the antiviral activities of GS-5734 and the parent nucleoside analog across multiple virus families, providing evidence to support new indications for this compound against human viruses of significant public health concern.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
