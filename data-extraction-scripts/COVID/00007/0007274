Although many adenoviruses have been identified in monkeys, the knowledge of these viruses from the Colobinae members is quite limited. FINDINGS: We conducted a surveillance of viral infection in endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) in the subfamily Colobinae in China, and found that 5.1% of sampled individuals were positive for adenovirus. One of the adenoviruses (SAdV-WIV19) was successfully isolated and its full-length genome was sequenced. The full-length genome of WIV19 is 33,562 bp in size, has a G + C content of 56.2%, and encodes 35 putative genes. Sequence analysis revealed that this virus represents a novel species in the genus Mastadenovirus. Diverse cell lines, including those of human origin, were susceptible to WIV19. CONCLUSION: We report the first time the isolation and full-length genomic characterization of an adenovirus from the subfamily Colobinae.
