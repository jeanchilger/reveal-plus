We assessed the effects of adoptive transfer of MSCs in acid aspiration acute lung injury and explored the role of long pentraxin PTX3. METHODS: We conducted a prospective experimental interventional study on wild-type (WT) and PTX3-deficient (PTX3(−/−)) mice. Acute lung injury was induced in WT and PTX3(−/−) mice by instillation of hydrochloric acid into the right bronchus. One hour later, animals received intraperitoneal sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), WT-MSCs (1 × 10(6)) or PTX3(−/−)-MSCs (1 × 10(6)). Twenty-four hours after injury, we measured the effects of treatments on arterial blood gases, wet/dry lung weight (W/D), CT scan analysis of lung collapse, neutrophils, TNFα and CXCL1 in bronchoalveolar lavage, and plasma PTX3. d-dimer was assayed in 1 week and OH-proline in 2 weeks to track the fibrotic evolution. RESULTS: In 24 h, in comparison to PBS, WT-MSCs improved oxygenation and reduced W/D and alveolar collapse. These effects were associated with decreased concentrations of alveolar neutrophils and cytokines. WT-MSCs increased d-dimer concentration and decreased OH-proline levels, too. Treatment with PTX3(−/−)-MSCs ameliorated oxygenation, W/D, and alveolar TNFα, though to a lesser extent than WT-MSCs. PTX3(−/−)-MSCs did not improve lung collapse, neutrophil count, CXCL1, d-dimer, and OH-proline concentrations. The protective effects of WT-MSCs were dampened by lack of endogenous PTX3, too. CONCLUSIONS: In acid aspiration acute lung injury, MSCs improve pulmonary function and limit fibrosis by fine-tuning inflammation. The role of PTX3 in determining MSCs’ effects might merit further scrutiny.
