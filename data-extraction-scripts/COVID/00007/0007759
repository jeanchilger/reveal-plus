<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-03-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Infrared thermal imaging in connective tissue diseases</TITLE><BODY>Infrared thermal imaging (IRT) is a non-invasive, non-contact technique which allows one to measure and visualize infrared radiation. In medicine, thermal imaging has been used for more than 50 years in various clinical settings, including Raynaud’s phenomenon and systemic sclerosis. Imaging and quantification of surface body temperature provides an indirect measure of the microcirculation’s overall performance. As such, IRT is capable of confirming the diagnosis of Raynaud’s phenomenon, and, with additional cold or heat challenge, of differentiating between the primary and secondary condition. In systemic sclerosis IRT has a potential role in assessing disease activity and monitoring treatment response. Despite certain limitations, thermal imaging can find a place in clinical practice, and with the introduction of small, low-cost infrared cameras, possibly become a part of routine rheumatological evaluation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
