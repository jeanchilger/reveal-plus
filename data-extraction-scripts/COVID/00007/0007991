<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-07-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Distribution and Evolutionary History of the Mobile Genetic Element s2m in Coronaviruses</TITLE><BODY>The mobile genetic element s2m has been described in several families of single-stranded RNA viruses. The function remains elusive, but an increasing number of s2m-containing sequences are being deposited in publicly available databases. Currently, more than 700 coronavirus sequences containing s2m can be found in GenBank, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus genome. This is an updated review of the pattern of s2m in coronaviruses, the possible functional implications and the evolutionary history.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
