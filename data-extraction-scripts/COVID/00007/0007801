Previous studies have shown that SIRT7 is required for RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription and pre-rRNA processing. Here, we took a proteomic approach to identify novel molecular targets and characterize the role of SIRT7 in non-nucleolar processes. We show that SIRT7 interacts with numerous proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolism, the majority of interactions requiring ongoing transcription. In addition to its role in Pol I transcription, we found that SIRT7 also regulates transcription of snoRNAs and mRNAs. Mechanistically, SIRT7 promotes the release of P-TEFb from the inactive 7SK snRNP complex and deacetylates CDK9, a subunit of the elongation factor P-TEFb, which activates transcription by phosphorylating serine 2 within the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II. SIRT7 counteracts GCN5-directed acetylation of lysine 48 within the catalytic domain of CDK9, deacetylation promoting CTD phosphorylation and transcription elongation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
