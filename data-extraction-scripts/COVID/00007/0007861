PMR is the root of Polygonum multiflorum. PMR is used to treat dizziness, spermatorrhea, sores, and scrofula as well as chronic malaria traditionally in China and Korea. The anti-tumor property of emodin was already reported. However, anti-viral activity of emodin on macrophages are not fully reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effects of emodin on RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, were evaluated. RESULTS: Emodin restored the cell viability in poly I: C-induced RAW 264.7 at concentrations of up to 50 μM. Emodin significantly inhibited the production of nitric oxide, IL-1α, IL-Ιβ, IL-6, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-Ιβ, MIP-2, RANTES, and IP-10 as well as calcium release and mRNA expression of signal transducer and activated transcription 1 (STAT1) in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study shows the inhibitory effect of emodin on poly I: C-induced RAW 264.7 via calcium-STAT pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
