In this study, we characterized the ultrastructure of NDiV, determined its complete genome sequence and made comparisons with other known nidoviruses. Electron microscopic observation revealed that the NDiV strain isolated in China produced viral nucleocapsid-like particles and vesicles in host cells. The extracellular virions were enveloped and were spherical with short spikes. The complete genome sequence of the newly isolated NDiV was submitted to the GenBank database (GenBank accession number KF522691). Sequencing of the viral genome showed that the homologies of NDiV isolated in China and Vietnam were greater than 94.0% and 89.0% at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels, respectively. Moreover, gene substitution was detected, whereas insertions and deletions were not. A phylogenetic tree analysis showed that these viruses belong to the genus Alphamesonivirus1 of the family Mesoniviridae. The similarity between the two viruses regarding morphological and molecular biological characteristics indicates that the molecular genetics of NDiV are conservative and that the regional differences are unlikely to have a significant effect. This is the first report of the isolation and complete sequencing of a mesonivirus in mainland China.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
