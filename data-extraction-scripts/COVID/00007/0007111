<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-11-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Computational Analysis of Cysteine Proteases (Clan CA, Family C1) of Leishmania major to Find Potential Epitopic Regions</TITLE><BODY>Leishmania is associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from simple cutaneous to invasive visceral leishmaniasis. Here, the sequences of ten cysteine proteases of types A, B and C of Leishmania major were obtained from GeneDB database. Prediction of MHC class I epitopes of these cysteine proteases was performed by NetCTL program version 1.2. In addition, by using BcePred server, different structural properties of the proteins were predicted to find out their potential B cell epitopes. According to this computational analysis, nine regions were predicted as B cell epitopes. The results provide useful information for designing peptide-based vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
