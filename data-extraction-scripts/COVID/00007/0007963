Methods: A total of 32 6-month-old New Zealand white rabbits were selected (averagely weighing 2.75–3.25 kg) and added TRI into nerve block solution for LPB. The rabbit were randomly divided into four groups: group A1: 2.5 ml × 2 times, group A2 2.5 ml × 4 times, group B1 5 ml × 2 times, and group B2 5 ml × 4 times; the time interval among the injection was 5 days, and the structural changes of FHC were the observed using 50/100/200 light microscope; the modified Mankin pathological scoring was also performed for the evaluation. Results: There exhibited significant microscopic changes of FHC structures between the rabbits performed LPB and the normal rabbits, among which group B2 exhibited the most serious FHC damages, and the Mankin pathological score in group B2 was much higher than those in the other three groups, and the scores of the experimental group were higher than the control group. Conclusions: The addition of TRI in LPB can damage the FHC structures, and large-dose (5 ml/once) and long-course (four times) will result in more serious injuries.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
