This study attempts to confirm these effects on the transplanted cervical cancer (U27) mouse model in vivo. METHODS: Forty eight Kunming mice were randomly divided in to six groups: normal control group (Control group), U27 tumor model group (Model group), cyclophosphamide administration group (CTX group),low-dose ASMq group (ASMq.L group), medium-dose ASMq group (ASMq.M group), and high-dose ASMq group (ASMq.H group). The five groups except normal control group transplanted with cervical cancer (U27) cells. We observed mice tumor inhibition rate and conducted the histopathological analysisUsing the western blot assay, the expression of TGF-β1 and TNF-α protein in transplanted cervical cancer U27 tumor tissue were detected. RESULTS: The tumor inhibition rates of CTX group, ASMq.L group, ASMq.M group, and ASMq.H group were 72.21, 31.27, 60.53 and 51.94% respectively, has obvious antitumor effect. ASMq significantly promote the spleen tlymphocyte proliferation of transplanted cervical cancer U27 mice. Invasive growth and diffusion rate in tumor tissue were accelerate in the transplanted cervical cancer U27 model group. Tumor tissue necrosis of tumor cells are smaller in the medium, high dosage group. Compared with the U27 model group, the expression levels of TGF-β1 protein and TNF-α protein expression exhibited statistically significant decreased in the mice tumor tissues in the CTX administration group and the ASMq administration group. CONCLUSIONS: ASMq has some antitumor effects on U27 model mice in vivo, The effects are achieved not only by improving the immune function of U27 model mice, but also by inhibiting the expression levels of TGF-β1 protein while promoting the expression levels of TNF-α protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
