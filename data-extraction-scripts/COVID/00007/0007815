The infection characterized by chills, fever, diarrhea, and myalgia can progress to hemorrhage and death. Hence, it is a high priority area to better understand its biology in order to expedite vaccine development pipelines. In this regard, this study analyzes the domains in RNA polymerase of fifteen publicly-available Ebola isolates belonging to three strains (Zaire, Sudan and Reston). The protein FASTA sequences of the isolates belonging Zaire, Sudan and Reston strains were extracted from UniProt database and submitted to the interactive web tool SMART for the polymerase domain profiles. Subsequent in silico investigation furnished interesting results that sure can contribute to the understanding of Ebola pathogenesis. The key findings and patterns have been presented, and based on them hypotheses have been formulated for further empirical validation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
