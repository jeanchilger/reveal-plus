<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-07-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Disability-Adjusted Life Years for Communicable Disease in the Korean Burden of Disease Study 2012</TITLE><BODY>Globally, the incidence of communicable diseases has decreased compared to non-communicable diseases. However, chronic communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis persist worldwide. Furthermore, emerging new infections such as H1N1 influenza pose a new threat to public health. However, most studies have focused on non-communicable diseases because of their increasing incidence, with fewer studies investigating communicable diseases. Therefore, we estimated the burden of communicable diseases in Korea using national representative 2012 data. To estimate the disability-adjusted life years (DALY), we used cause of death data from the Statistics Korea to estimate the years of life lost (YLL), applied the Korean garbage code algorithm, and used national claims data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) to estimate years lived with disability (YLD). In 2012, the total DALYs of communicable disease were 445 per 100,000, with 129 YLLs per 100,000 and 316 YLDs per 100,000. The total DALYs in men were 468 per 100,000, greater than the 422 per 100,000 DALYs seen in women. The DALYs of lower respiratory infections were the highest value among communicable diseases at 143/100,000 DALYs followed by tuberculosis and upper respiratory infections. The 40-49 years old age group had the largest number of total DALYs. In contrast, the over 80 years old age group had the largest number of total DALYs per 100,000 followed by the 70-79 and 0-9 years old age groups. These results enable the prioritization of interventions related to communicable diseases and can be used for evidence-based public health policies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
