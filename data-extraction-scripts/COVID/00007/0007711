METHODS: Samples were tested between 1996 and 2011 by the Department of Clinical Virology at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria. All samples were sent to the university as part of routine diagnostic procedures, either to determine infection in clinically symptomatic individuals or to rule out infection prior to vaccination. To allow for statistical comparison, samples analysed between 2008 and 2011 were pooled into one population (n = 444) and evaluated against samples tested in 1996 (n = 840). Furthermore, analyses of subgroups were undertaken to determine the effect of sex and age on the prevalence of FeLV antigenaemia. RESULTS: With respect to the samples tested at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, it was determined that the level of FeLV antigenaemia in eastern Austria between 1996 and 2011 was 5.6%. The proportion of FeLV antigenaemic cats was highly variable and has not fallen significantly over this period, despite advances in vaccination, and the education of pet owners and animal welfare charities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study confirms the importance of continued and regular vaccination against FeLV among Austrian cats, particularly those allowed access to the outdoors. Within the remit of this retrospective study, it was not possible to follow-up results of repeat testing or of other assays (PCR) of individual cats. As a result of this, no conclusions can be drawn as to the possibility of transient antigenaemic cats or false-positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
