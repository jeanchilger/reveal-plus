From the crystal structure viewpoint the observation emerges that PpcA protein can bind with Deoxycholate (DXCA), while its other homologs do not. But it is yet to be established with certainty the reason behind this from primary protein sequence information. This study is primarily based on primary protein sequence analysis through the chemical basis of embedded amino acids. Firstly, we look for the chemical group specific score of amino acids. Along with this, we have developed a new methodology for the phylogenetic analysis based on chemical group dissimilarities of amino acids. This new methodology is applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and pinpoint how a particular sequence is differing with others. Secondly, we build a graph theoretic model on using amino acid sequences which is also applied to the cytochrome c7 family members and some unique characteristics and their domains are highlighted. Thirdly, we search for unique patterns as subsequences which are common among the group or specific individual member. In all the cases, we are able to show some distinct features of PpcA that emerges PpcA as an outstanding protein compared to its other homologs, resulting towards its binding with deoxycholate. Similarly, some notable features for the structurally dissimilar protein PpcD compared to the other homologs are also brought out. Further, the five members of cytochrome family being homolog proteins, they must have some common significant features which are also enumerated in this study.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
