The aim of this study was to define the key cytokine(s) responsible for trypsin upregulation. Mice were infected with influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) or treated individually or with a combination of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α. The levels of these cytokines and trypsin in the lungs were monitored. The neutralizing effects of anti-IL-1β antibodies on cytokine and trypsin expression in human A549 cells and lung inflammation in the infected mice were examined. Infection induced interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and ectopic trypsin in mouse lungs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Intraperitoneal administration of interleukin-1β combined with other cytokines tended to upregulate trypsin and cytokine expression in the lungs, but the combination without interleukin-1β did not induce trypsin. In contrast, incubation of A549 cells with interleukin-1β alone induced both cytokines and trypsin, and anti-interleukin-1β antibody treatment abrogated these effects. Administration of the antibody in the infected mice reduced lung inflammation area. These findings suggest that IL-1β plays a key role in trypsin upregulation and has a pathological role in multiple organ failure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
