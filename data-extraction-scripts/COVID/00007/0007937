Since pathology in such diseases is often attributed to an over-active inflammatory response, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells respond to stimulation of their receptors for viral ligands with a strong antiviral response, but unlike in human cells, the inflammatory response is not overtly activated. We compared the response of human and bat cells to poly(I:C), a viral double-stranded RNA surrogate. We measured transcripts for several inflammatory, interferon and interferon stimulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR and observed that human and bat cells both, when stimulated with poly(I:C), contained higher levels of transcripts for interferon beta than unstimulated cells. In contrast, only human cells expressed robust amount of RNA for TNFα, a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation. We examined the bat TNFα promoter and found a potential repressor (c-Rel) binding motif. We demonstrated that c-Rel binds to the putative c-Rel motif in the promoter and knocking down c-Rel transcripts significantly increased basal levels of TNFα transcripts. Our results suggest bats may have a unique mechanism to suppress inflammatory pathology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
