In this study, we conducted a comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of lung responses in mice exposed to six individual TiO(2)NPs exhibiting different sizes (8, 20 and 300nm), crystalline structure (anatase, rutile or anatase/rutile) and surface modifications (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) to investigate whether the mechanisms leading to TiO(2)NP-induced lung inflammation are property specific. A detailed histopathological analysis was conducted to investigate the long-term disease implications of acute exposure to TiO(2)NPs. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 18, 54, 162 or 486 µg of TiO(2)NPs/mouse via single intratracheal instillation. Controls were exposed to dispersion medium only. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were sampled on 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. Although all TiO(2)NPs induced lung inflammation as measured by the neutrophil influx in BALF, rutile-type TiO(2)NPs induced higher inflammation with the hydrophilic rutile TiO(2)NP showing the maximum increase. Accordingly, the rutile TiO(2)NPs induced higher number of differentially expressed genes. Histopathological analysis of lung sections on Day 90 post-exposure showed increased collagen staining and fibrosis-like changes following exposure to the rutile TiO(2)NPs at the highest dose tested. Among the anatase, the smallest TiO(2)NP of 8nm showed the maximum response. The anatase TiO(2)NP of 300nm was the least responsive of all. The results suggest that the severity of lung inflammation is property specific; however, the underlying mechanisms (genes and pathways perturbed) leading to inflammation were the same for all particle types. While the particle size clearly influenced the overall acute lung responses, a combination of small size, crystalline structure and hydrophilic surface contributed to the long-term pathological effects observed at the highest dose (486 µg/mouse). Although the dose at which the pathological changes were observed is considered physiologically high, the study highlights the disease potential of certain TiO(2)NPs of specific properties.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
