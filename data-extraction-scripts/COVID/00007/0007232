Previous studies observed that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) enhanced the angiogenic and osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells by activating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), thereby improving the bone repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. In the present study, it was investigated whether DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the treatment of ONFH. Western blot analysis was performed to detect HIF-1α protein expression in ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. The results showed DMOG enhanced HIF-1α expression in ASCs in a dose-dependent manner at least for 7 days. Furthermore, DMOG-treated ASCs were transplanted into the necrotic area of a rabbit model of ONFH to treat the disease. Four weeks later, micro-computed tomography (CT) quantitative analysis showed that 58.8±7.4% of the necrotic area was regenerated in the DMOG-treated ASCs transplantation group, 45.5±3.4% in normal ASCs transplantation group, 25.2±2.8% in only core decompression group and 10.6±2.6% in the untreated group. Histological analysis showed that transplantation of DMOG-treated ASCs clearly improved the bone regeneration of the necrotic area compared with the other three groups. Micro-CT and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the revasculation of the necrotic area were also increased significantly in the DMOG-treated ASC group compared with the control groups. Thus, it is hypothesized that DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of ASCs through enhancing HIF-1α expression in the treatment of ONFH.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
