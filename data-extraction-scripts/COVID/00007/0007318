We aimed to investigate the prevalence of RV genotypes, sensitization status and clinical characteristics of patients having a respiratory infection caused by either different RV species or other respiratory viruses. The study enrolled 111 patients (aged 3–23 months, 79% hospitalized, 76% with RV infection) with the first wheezing episode. RV-specific sequences were identified by partial sequencing of VP4/VP2 and 5′ non-coding regions with 80% success rate. The investigated clinical and laboratory variables included atopic characteristics and illness severity, parental atopic illnesses, and parental smoking. Of the study children, 56% percent had ≥1 atopic characteristic (atopy, eczema and/or blood eosinophil count ≥0.4×10(9)/L) and 23% were sensitised to allergens. RV-C was detected in 58% of RV positive samples, followed by RV-A (20%) and RV-B (1.2%). Children with RV-A and RV-C induced wheezing were older (p = 0.014) and had more atopic characteristics (p = 0.001) than those with non-RV. RV-A and RV-C illnesses had shorter duration of preadmission symptoms and required more bronchodilator use at the ward than non-RV illnesses (both p < 0.05, respectively) RV-C is the most common cause of severe early wheezing. Atopic and illness severity features are associated with children having RV-A or RV-C induced first wheezing episode rather than with children having a non-RV induced wheezing.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
