<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008</DATELINE><TITLE>Application of siRNA Against SARS in the Rhesus Macaque Model</TITLE><BODY>Containment of the SARS coronavirus (SCV) outbreak was accompanied by the rapid characterization of this new pathogen's genome sequence in 2003, encouraging the development of anti-SCV therapeutics using short interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibitors. A pair of siRNA duplexes identified as potent SCV inhibitors in vitro was evaluated for in vivo efficacy and safety in a rhesus macaque SARS model using intranasal administration with clinical viable delivery carrier in three dosing regimens. Observations of SCV-induced SARS-like symptoms, measurements of SCV RNA presence in the respiratory tract, microscopic inspections of lung histopathology, and immunohistochemistry sections from 21 tested macaques consistently demonstrated siRNA-mediated anti-SCV activity. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacies resulted in relief of animals from SCV infection-induced fever, diminished SCV in upper airway and lung alveoli, and milder acute diffuse alveoli damage (DAD). The dosages of siRNA used, 10 to 40 mg/kg, did not show any sign of siRNA-induced toxicity. These results support that a clinical investigation of this anti-SARS siRNA therapeutic agent is warranted. The study also illustrates the capability of siRNA to enable a massive reduction in development time for novel targeted therapeutic agents. We detail a representative example of large-mammal siRNA use.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
