Rapid and reliable diagnosis of human coronavirus infections therefore becomes indispensable in a routine clinical setting. In this study, we present a very sensitive and specific TaqMan-based, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) for the rapid detection and quantitation of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43 and 229E. Absolute viral load measurement in clinical samples was achieved through the construction of in-house HCoV OC43 and 229E cRNA standards for the generation of a standard curve. The HCoV OC43 assay allows quantitation over a range from 20 to 2 × 10(8) RNA copies per reaction mixture (5 μl RNA extract). When this is extrapolated to clinical samples, this corresponds to a detection range of 10(3) to 10(10) viral genome equivalents per ml. By using the HCoV 229E qRT-PCR assay, viral RNA copies ranging from 200 to 2 × 10(9) per reaction mixture can be detected, which corresponds to 10(4) to 10(11) viral genome equivalents per ml sample. A total of 100 respiratory samples screened for the presence of HCoVs OC43 and 229E by using conventional RT-PCR were assessed in parallel by the qRT-PCR assays. By use of the real-time qRT-PCR techniques, the detection rate of HCoVs OC43 and 229E increased from 2.0% to 3.1% and from 0.3% to 2.5%, respectively. The real-time qRT-PCR assays described here allow the rapid, specific, and sensitive laboratory detection and quantitation of human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
