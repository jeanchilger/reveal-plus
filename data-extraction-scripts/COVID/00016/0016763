<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-06-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Gross Morphometry, Histomorphometry, and Immunohistochemistry Confirm Early and Persistent Jejunal Crypt Hyperplasia in Poults with Enteritis and Depressed Growth</TITLE><BODY>Phosphorylated histone 3 (PH3) and cleaved caspase 3 (CCASP3) were used to detect proliferating and apoptotic cells, respectively, in the jejunums of female sibling poults, with and without enteritis and depressed growth, from hatch to day 35. Poults that developed enteritis and depressed growth (SIB flock) were raised on a commercial farm in eastern North Carolina, whereas poults with normal growth and no enteritis (TAU flock) were raised in the Teaching Animal Unit at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Beginning on day 5 through day 35 and at processing, TAU poults were significantly heavier than SIB poults. Jejunal weights, relative jejunal weights, and jejunal densities were greater in SIB poults from day 10 through 35. Jejunal efficiency (body weight /jejunal length) was higher in TAU poults at day 5 and days 10 through 35. Mucosal thickness was greater in SIB poults between days 7 and 21 but greater in TAU poults at days 28 and 35. From day 7 to 35, villus-to-crypt ratios were higher for TAU poults and lower for SIB poults because hyperplastic crypts formed a greater percentage of the mucosa in SIB poults. By day 7, PH3- and CCASP3-positive cells were increased in SIB poults, showing that mucosal changes resulted from combined crypt epithelial hyperplasia and increased apoptosis of villous enterocytes. Findings in this study confirm that enteritis, in the absence of clinical signs, and depressed growth in turkey poults begins by day 7, can be identified microscopically, persists for at least 35 days, is associated with lower processing weights, and has a profound negative effect on turkey growth.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
