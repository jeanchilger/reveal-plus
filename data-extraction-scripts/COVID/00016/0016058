<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-11-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Wildlife: The Need to Better Understand the Linkages</TITLE><BODY>Wildlife are frequently a neglected component of One Health; however, the linkages between the health of wildlife and human, domestic animal, and environmental health are clear. The majority of emerging zoonotic diseases are linked to wildlife, primarily driven by anthropogenic land changes. Despite this risk, wildlife have important links to people as environmental indicators, food security and safety, and through human livelihoods. This chapter will describe these linkages and demonstrate the need to understand these linkages through targeted surveillance and understanding the ecology of wildlife diseases. While the management of wildlife diseases presents a significant challenge, such practices will greatly improve the health of people, domestic animals, wildlife and the environment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
