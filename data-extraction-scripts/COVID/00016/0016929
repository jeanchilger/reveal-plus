<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-07-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Targeting Transmission Pathways for Emerging Zoonotic Disease Surveillance and Control</TITLE><BODY>We used literature searches and a database of all reported emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) to analyze the most important transmission pathways (e.g., vector-borne, aerosol droplet transmitted) for emerging zoonoses. Our results suggest that at the broad scale, the likelihood of transmission occurring through any one pathway is approximately equal. However, the major transmission pathways for zoonoses differ widely according to the specific underlying drivers of EID events (e.g., land-use change, agricultural intensification). These results can be used to develop better targeting of surveillance for, and more effective control of newly emerged zoonoses in regions under different underlying pressures that drive disease emergence.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
