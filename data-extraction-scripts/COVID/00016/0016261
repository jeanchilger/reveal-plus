<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-05-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Prediction of Virulence Factors Using Bioinformatics Approaches</TITLE><BODY>Virulence factors produced by a pathogen are essential for causing disease in the host. They enable the pathogen to establish itself within the host thus enhancing its potential to cause disease and in some instances underlie evasion of host defense mechanisms. Identification of these molecules, especially those of immunological interest and their use in vaccine development are attractive and are among the initial steps of reverse vaccinology. Surface localized virulence factors such as adhesins serve as excellent immunogenic candidates in this regard. In this chapter we have described the bioinformatics approaches for adhesin prediction, which include specific adhesin prediction algorithms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
