<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-12-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Serological Diagnosis of Feline Coronavirus Infection by Immunochromatographic Test</TITLE><BODY>The immunochromatographic assay (ICA) is a simple antibody–antigen detection method, the results of which can be rapidly obtained at a low cost. We designed an ICA to detect anti-feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibodies. A colloidal gold-labeled recombinant FCoV nucleocapsid protein (rNP) is used as a conjugate. The Protein A and affinity-purified cat anti-FCoV IgG are blotted on the test line and the control line, respectively, of the nitrocellulose membrane. The specific detection of anti-FCoV antibodies was possible in all heparin-anticoagulated plasma, serum, whole blood, and ascitic fluid samples from anti-FCoV antibody positive cats, and nonspecific reaction was not noted in samples from anti-FCoV antibody negative cats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
