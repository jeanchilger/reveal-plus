<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-05-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Diagnostics and Surveillance for Swine Influenza</TITLE><BODY>Collective knowledge regarding the occurrence of influenza among swine is incomplete due to inconsistent surveillance of swine populations. In this chapter, we review what surveillance activities exist and some of the practical challenges encountered. Furthermore, to support robust surveillance activities, accurate laboratory assays are needed for the detection of the virus and viral nucleic acids within clinical samples, or for antiviral antibodies in serum samples. The most common influenza diagnostic assays used for swine are explained and their use as surveillance tools evaluated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
