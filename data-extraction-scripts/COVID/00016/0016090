The presence of a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) surface glycoprotein in addition to the viral spike protein is a distinguishing characteristic of most group 2a coronaviruses. BCoV is ubiquitous in cattle worldwide and is an economically significant cause of calf diarrhea, winter dysentery of adult cattle, and respiratory disease in calves and feedlot cattle. We have developed and optimized laboratory diagnostic techniques, including virus isolation in HRT-18 cell cultures, antibody and antigen ELISA, and RT-PCR, for rapid, sensitive, and reliable diagnosis of BCoV and related wild ruminant coronaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
