<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-06-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Thematic Minireview Series on Circular Proteins</TITLE><BODY>Circular proteins have now been discovered in all kingdoms of life and are characterized by their exceptional stability and the diversity of their biological activities, primarily in the realm of host defense functions. This thematic minireview series provides an overview of the distribution, evolution, activities, and biological synthesis of circular proteins. It also reviews approaches that biological chemists are taking to develop synthetic methods for making circular proteins in the laboratory. These approaches include solid-phase peptide synthesis based on an adaption of native chemical ligation technology and recombinant DNA approaches that are amenable to the in-cell production of cyclic peptide libraries. The thioester-mediated native chemical ligation approach mimics, to some extent, elements of the natural biosynthetic reaction, which, for disulfide-rich cyclic peptides, appears to involve asparaginyl endopeptidase-mediated processing from larger precursor proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
