Unlike the nsp1 protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, a betacoronavirus, the TGEV nsp1 protein was unable to bind 40S ribosomal subunits or promote host mRNA degradation. TGEV nsp1 also suppressed protein translation in cell-free HeLa cell extract; however, it did not affect translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). Our data suggested that HeLa cell extracts and cultured host cells, but not RRL, contain a host factor(s) that is essential for TGEV nsp1-induced translational suppression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
