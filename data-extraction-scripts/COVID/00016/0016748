The present study reports an unusual case of C. krusei pneumonia that was initially suspected to be a Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) case. A 64-year-old Saudi Arabian male patient was admitted to our hospital with complaints of cough and dyspnea that persisted for 6 days. The patient presented fever (oral temperature, 38.5°C) and slight tachypnea (25 respirations/min). A chest computerized tomography demonstrated unclear lung fields, diffuse pathological changes in the two lungs and multiple lymphadenectasis in the retrocaval and para-aortic arch area. The patient received 95–98% oxygen (6 l/min) for 24 h, as well as sulbactam sodium/cefoperazone sodium (1:1) injection (3.0 g) every 12 h, oral oseltamivir capsules (75 mg/time) twice a day, medaron injection (80 mg/time) and 750 ml fluid infusion; however, he succumbed to the disease on day 2 after admission. The infection was diagnosed by sputum smear and culture subsequent to patient mortality. A sputum smear showed a large fungal infection and sputum culture revealed the presence of C. krusei infection. Serum procalcitonin concentrations were 4.73 µg/l and 7.23 µg/l on days 2 and 3 after admission, respectively. In conclusion, the diagnosis of Candida pneumonia should be strongly considered in the presence of growth of Candida from a sputum culture and based on a suggestive computed tomography image. Tumescent diaphragmatic lymph nodes may also be an important symptom of Candida pneumonia. Treatment should be initiated immediately to improve tissue oxygenation, restore cardiovascular function and improve other organ functions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
