In this work, we describe the feasibility of using a DNA reaction network as the computational core of a protocell, which will perform an artificial immune response in a concise way to eliminate a mimicked pathogenic challenge. Such a DNA reaction network (RN)-powered protocell can realize the connection of logical computation and biological recognition due to the natural programmability and biological properties of DNA. Thus, the biological input molecules can be easily involved in the molecular computation and the computation process can be spatially isolated and protected by artificial bilayer membrane. We believe the strategy proposed in the current paper, i.e., using DNA RN to power artificial cells, will lay the groundwork for understanding the basic design principles of DNA algorithm-based nanodevices which will, in turn, inspire the construction of artificial cells, or protocells, that will find a place in future biomedical research.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
