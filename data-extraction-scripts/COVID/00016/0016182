<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-06-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins in Escherichia coli with a His(6) or Dual His(6)-MBP Tag</TITLE><BODY>Rapid advances in bioengineering and biotechnology over the past three decades have greatly facilitated the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. Affinity-based methods that employ protein or peptide based tags for protein purification have been instrumental in this progress. Yet insolubility of recombinant proteins in E. coli remains a persistent problem. One way around this problem is to fuse an aggregation-prone protein to a highly soluble partner. E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) is widely acknowledged as a highly effective solubilizing agent. In this chapter, we describe how to construct either a His(6)- or a dual His(6)-MBP tagged fusion protein by Gateway(®) recombinational cloning and how to evaluate their yield and solubility. We also describe a simple and rapid procedure to test the solubility of proteins after removing their N-terminal fusion tags by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease digestion. The choice of whether to use a His(6) tag or a His(6)-MBP tag can be made on the basis of this solubility test.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
