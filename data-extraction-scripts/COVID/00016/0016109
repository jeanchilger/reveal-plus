<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-04-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Advances in MALDI Mass Spectrometry in Clinical Diagnostic Applications</TITLE><BODY>The concept of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) was first reported in 1985. Since then, MALDI MS technologies have been evolving, and successfully used in genome, proteome, metabolome, and clinical diagnostic research. These technologies are high-throughput and sensitive. Emerging evidence has shown that they are not only useful in qualitative and quantitative analyses of proteins, but also of other types of biomolecules, such as DNA, glycans, and metabolites. Recently, parallel fragmentation monitoring (PFM), which is a method comparable to selected reaction monitoring, has been reported. This highlights the potentials of MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS in quantification of metabolites. Here we critically review the applications of the major MALDI MS technologies, including MALDI-TOF MS, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, SALDI-TOF MS, MALDI-QqQ MS, and SELDI-TOF MS, to the discovery and quantification of disease biomarkers in biological specimens, especially those in plasma/serum specimens. Using SELDI-TOF MS as an example, the presence of systemic bias in biomarker discovery studies employing MALDI-TOF MS and its possible solutions are also discussed in this chapter. The concepts of MALDI, SALDI, SELDI, and PFM are complementary to each other. Theoretically, all these technologies can be combined, leading to the next generation of the MALDI MS technologies. Real applications of MALDI MS technologies in clinical diagnostics should be forthcoming.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
