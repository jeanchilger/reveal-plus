<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>Application of ProteinChip Array Profiling in Serum Biomarker Discovery for Patients Suffering From Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</TITLE><BODY>A new strain of coronavirus has caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from 2002 to 2003 resulting in 774 deaths worldwide. By protein chip array profiling technology, a number of serum biomarkers that might be useful in monitoring the clinical course of SARS patients were identified. This book chapter describes how the protein chip array profiling was carried out for this study. Briefly, SARS patients’ serum samples were first fractionated in Q Ceramic HyperD ion exchange sorbent beads by buffers at different pH. Serum protein fractions thus obtained were then bound onto a copper (II) immobilized metal affinity capture (IMAC30 Cu [II]) ProteinChip® Array or a weak cation-exchange (CM10) ProteinChip Array. After washing and addition of sinapinic acid, the chips were read in a Protein Biological System (PBS) IIc mass spectrometer. Ions were generated by laser shots and flied in a time of flight mode to the ion detector according to their mass over charge (m/z) ratio. The serum profiling spectra in SARS patients were acquired, baseline subtracted and analyzed in parallel with those from the control subjects by Ciphergen ProteinChip Software 3.0.2 with their peak intensities compared by a nonparametric two sample Mann-Whitney-U test. More than twelve peaks were differentially expressed in SARS patients with one at m/z of 11,695 (later identified to be serum amyloid A protein), which had increase in peak intensity correlating with the extent of SARS-coronavirus induced pneumonia as defined by a serial chest X-ray opacity score. The remaining biomarkers could also be useful in the study of other clinical parameters in SARS patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
