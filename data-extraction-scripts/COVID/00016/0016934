<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-12-01</DATELINE><TITLE>The ABCs of the US Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials Program: Antibiotics, Biosecurity, and Congress</TITLE><BODY>Antibiotic resistance has been increasing at an alarming rate in the United States and globally for decades, but the problem has only recently gained broad attention at the highest levels of the US government. More and more patients are dying of infections that do not respond to antibiotics that are currently available. Meanwhile, the antibacterial product pipeline remains fragile in part because of a lack of commercial interest from pharmaceutical companies. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) Broad Spectrum Antimicrobials (BSA) program leads the US government's effort to bridge this gap by advancing new antibacterials through late stages of clinical development. Other commentators have described in detail BARDA's structure, process, and role in antibacterial development. This commentary offers a public policy perspective on the emerging politics of antibiotic resistance in the context of US biosecurity politics and medical countermeasure (MCM) development. It identifies promising developments and difficult challenges that together will ultimately determine whether BARDA can become a global leader for antibiotic development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
