These small membrane proteins assemble into oligomers that can permeabilize cellular lipid bilayers, disrupting the physiology of the host to the advantage of the virus. Consequently, efforts during the last few decades have been focused towards the discovery of viroporin channel inhibitors, but in general these have not been successful to produce licensed drugs. Viroporins are also involved in viral pathogenesis by engaging in critical interactions with viral proteins, or disrupting normal host cellular pathways through coordinated interactions with host proteins. These protein-protein interactions (PPIs) may become alternative attractive drug targets for the development of antivirals. In this sense, while thus far most antiviral molecules have targeted viral proteins, focus is moving towards targeting host proteins that are essential for virus replication. In principle, this largely would overcome the problem of resistance, with the possibility of using repositioned existing drugs. The precise role of these PPIs, their strain- and host- specificities, and the structural determination of the complexes involved, are areas that will keep the fields of virology and structural biology occupied for years to come. In the present review, we provide an update of the efforts in the characterization of the main PPIs for most viroporins, as well as the role of viroporins in these PPIs interactions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
