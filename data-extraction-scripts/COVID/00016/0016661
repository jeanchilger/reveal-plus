Although the molecular consequences of SUMO attachment are difficult to predict, the underlying principle of SUMOylation is altering inter- and/or intramolecular interactions of the modified substrate, changing localization, stability, and/or activity. Unsurprisingly, many different pathogens have evolved to exploit the cellular SUMO modification system due to its functional flexibility and far-reaching functional downstream consequences. Although the extensive knowledge gained so far is impressive, a definitive conclusion about the role of SUMO modification during virus infection in general remains elusive and is still restricted to a few, yet promising concepts. Based on the available data, this review aims, first, to provide a detailed overview of the current state of knowledge and, second, to evaluate the currently known common principles/molecular mechanisms of how human pathogenic microbes, especially viruses and their regulatory proteins, exploit the host cell SUMO modification system.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
