The early host response to viral infection is initiated by the cells of the innate immune response, including macrophages. Here, we have characterized the secretome of HSV-1-infected human primary macrophages using high-throughput quantitative proteomics. We identified and quantified 516 distinct human proteins with high confidence from the macrophage secretome upon HSV-1 infection, and the secretion of 411 proteins was >2-fold increased upon beta interferon (IFN-β) priming and/or HSV-1 infection. Bioinformatics analysis of the secretome data revealed that most of the secreted proteins were intracellular, and almost 80% of the proteins whose secretion increased more than 2-fold were known exosomal proteins. This strongly suggests that nonclassical, vesicle-mediated protein secretion is activated in IFN-β-primed and HSV-1-infected macrophages. Proteins related to immune and inflammatory responses, interferon-induced proteins, and endogenous danger signal proteins were efficiently secreted upon IFN-β priming and HSV-1 infection. The secreted IFN-induced proteins include interferon-induced tetratricopeptide protein 2 (IFIT2), IFIT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), implicating that these proteins also have important extracellular antiviral functions. Proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β was not released by HSV-1-infected macrophages, demonstrating that HSV-1 can antagonize inflammasome function. In conclusion, our results provide a global view of the secretome of HSV-1-infected macrophages, revealing host factors possibly having a role in antiviral defense.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
