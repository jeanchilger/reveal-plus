<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-08-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Simultaneous Detection and Differentiation of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Other Respiratory Viral Pathogens</TITLE><BODY>Rapid and accurate detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) provides pathogen-specific diagnosis, allows implementation of appropriate infection control measures, and improves patient management. One diagnostic challenge is that respiratory infections, which can be caused by several viral pathogens including RSV, usually present with similar signs and symptoms that are nearly indistinguishable by clinical diagnosis. We have described in the chapter a rapid, high-throughput laboratory technique that can detect a panel of common viral pathogens in one single reaction. With the combination of target-enriched multiplexing PCR amplification and Luminex suspension array identification, 12 common respiratory viruses, including RSV A and B, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and SARS coronavirus, are detected and differentiated simultaneously within five hours.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
