<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-09-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Peak Oil, Urban Form, and Public Health: Exploring the Connections</TITLE><BODY>We assessed the relationships between peak oil and urban form, travel behavior, and public health. Peak oil will affect the general economy, travel behavior, and urban form through income and substitution effects; however, because of the wide range of substitution possibilities, the impacts are likely to be gradual and relatively small. Furthermore, we suggest that changes in travel behavior and increases in urban density will have both favorable and unfavorable effects on public health. To mitigate the adverse impacts and to maximize the positive effects of peak oil, we recommend that careful attention should be paid to urban design and public health responses for a range of urbanization patterns.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
