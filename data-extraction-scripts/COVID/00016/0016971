Purportedly, these viruses bind to O-acetylated sialic acids (O-Ac-Sias) primarily through S, with HE serving merely as receptor-destroying enzyme. Here, we show that, in apparent contrast to human and ungulate host range variants of Betacoronavirus-1, murine coronaviruses actually bind to O-Ac-Sias via HE exclusively. Apparently, expansion of group A betacoronaviruses into new hosts and niches was accompanied by changes in HE ligand and substrate preference and in the roles of HE and S in Sia receptor usage.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
