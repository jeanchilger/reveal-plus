<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-11-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Large-Scale Preparation of UV-Inactivated SARS Coronavirus Virions for Vaccine Antigen</TITLE><BODY>In general, a whole virion serves as a simple vaccine antigen and often essential material for the analysis of immune responses against virus infection. However, to work with highly contagious pathogens, it is necessary to take precautions against laboratory-acquired infection. We have learned many lessons from the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In order to develop an effective vaccine and diagnostic tools, we prepared UV-inactivated SARS coronavirus on a large scale under the strict Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) regulation. Our protocol for large-scale preparation of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV including virus expansion, titration, inactivation, and ultracentrifugation is applicable to any newly emerging virus we might encounter in the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
