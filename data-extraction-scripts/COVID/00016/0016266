Purified preparations of virions can be used to address these questions using techniques such as mass spectrometry proteomics. Recent studies on the proteome of coronavirus virions have shown that in addition to the structural proteins, accessory and non-structural virus proteins and a wide variety of host cell proteins associate with virus particles. To further study the presence of virion proteins, high-quality sample preparation is crucial to ensure reproducible analysis by the wide variety of methods available for proteomic analysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
