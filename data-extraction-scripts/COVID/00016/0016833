<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Investigation of antimicrobial and protease-inhibitory activity from cultured cyanobacteria</TITLE><BODY>A culture collection of cyanobacteria has been established at the University of Illinois at Chicago. This collection includes marine, terrestrial, and freshwater strains and contains representatives of the five orders of cyanobacteria: Chroococcales, Pleurocapsales, Oscillatoriales, Nostocales, and Stigonematales. In this study, extracts from a subset of 61 strains, 16 marine and 45 freshwater/terrestrial, were evaluated against three current protease targets, i.e. 20S proteasome and two SARS viral proteases, two important bacterial targets, i.e. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Bacillus anthracis, and in the Artemia salina toxicity assay. In total, extracts of 12 strains possessed significant levels of activity in one or more targets. The overwhelming majority of active extracts (11 of 12) were from either freshwater or terrestrial forms of cyanobacteria, with the greater part of these (9 of 12) being heterocyst-forming strains. These results further support the use of cultured cyanobacteria as a source of biologically active natural products.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
