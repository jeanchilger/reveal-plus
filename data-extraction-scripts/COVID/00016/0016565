The pseudoknot is unusual in that it would include a 7 nucleotide loop (termed here an interstem element [ISE]) between the two stems. In almost all frameshift-promoting pseudoknots, ISEs are absent or comprise a single adenosine residue. Using a combination of RNA structure probing, site directed mutagenesis, NMR, and phylogenetic sequence comparisons, we show here that the VMV stimulatory RNA is indeed a pseudoknot, conforming closely to the modeled structure, and that the ISE is essential for frameshifting. Pseudoknot function was predictably sensitive to changes in the length of the ISE, yet altering its sequence to alternate pyrimidine/purine bases was also detrimental to frameshifting, perhaps through modulation of local tertiary interactions. How the ISE is placed in the context of an appropriate helical junction conformation is not known, but its presence impacts on other elements of the pseudoknot, for example, the necessity for a longer than expected loop 1. This may be required to accommodate an increased flexibility of the pseudoknot brought about by the ISE. In support of this, (1)H NMR analysis at increasing temperatures revealed that stem 2 of the VMV pseudoknot is more labile than stem 1, perhaps as a consequence of its connection to stem 1 solely via flexible single-stranded loops.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
