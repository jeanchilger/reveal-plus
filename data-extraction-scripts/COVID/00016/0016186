The following chapter summarizes the principles how such RNAs can be established and used for design of vaccines. Due to the large variety of strategies needed to circumvent specific pitfalls in the design of such constructs the technical details of the experiments are not described here but can be found in the cited literature.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
