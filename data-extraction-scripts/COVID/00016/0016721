<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-02-06</DATELINE><TITLE>RespiFinder: a New Multiparameter Test To Differentially Identify Fifteen Respiratory Viruses</TITLE><BODY>Broad-spectrum analysis for pathogens in patients with respiratory tract infections is becoming more relevant as the number of potential infectious agents is still increasing. Here we describe the new multiparameter RespiFinder assay, which is based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology. This assay detects 15 respiratory viruses in one reaction. The MLPA reaction is preceded by a preamplification step which ensures the detection of both RNA and DNA viruses with the same specificity and sensitivity as individual monoplex real-time reverse transcription-PCRs. The RespiFinder assay was validated with 144 clinical samples, and the results of the assay were compared to those of cell culture and a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-specific immunochromatography assay (ICA). Compared to the cell culture results, the RespiFinder assay showed specificities and sensitivities of 98.2% and 100%, respectively, for adenovirus; 96.4% and 100%, respectively, for human metapneumovirus; 98.2% and 100%, respectively, for influenza A virus (InfA); 99.1% and 100%, respectively, for parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV-1); 99.1% and 80%, respectively, for PIV-3; 90.1% and 100%, respectively, for rhinovirus; and 94.6% and 100%, respectively, for RSV. Compared to the results of the RSV-specific ICA, the RespiFinder assay gave a specificity and a sensitivity of 82.4% and 80%, respectively. PIV-2, PIV-4, influenza B virus, InfA H5N1, and coronavirus 229E were not detected in the clinical specimens tested. The use of the RespiFinder assay resulted in an increase in the diagnostic yield compared to that obtained by cell culture (diagnostic yields, 60% and 35.5%, respectively). In conclusion, the RespiFinder assay provides a user-friendly and high-throughput tool for the simultaneous detection of 15 respiratory viruses with excellent overall performance statistics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
