The aim of this study was to determine the activity of respiratory viruses in the epidemic season 2016/2017 in Poland, with particular emphasis on influenza viruses among people aged over 14. There were 2982 clinical samples taken from patients from four age groups: 15–25, 26–44, 45–64, and ≥ 65 years tested under the Sentinel and non-Sentinel surveillance programs. The presence of influenza viruses was confirmed in more than 40% of cases, the predominant type was influenza A virus unsubtyped, followed by subtype A/H3N2/. The results for the four age groups indicate that the highest number of confirmed respiratory viruses was recorded in individuals ≥65 years of age, slightly less, in the decreasing order, in the age groups 45–64 years, 15–25 years, and 26–44 years. Influenza type B infections were observed only in sporadic cases. Given the epidemiological data, epidemic season 2016/2017 was characterized by similar dynamics compared to the previous season in Poland and also in most of the European countries. More than 4 million cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses have been reported in Poland, more than 16,000 hospitalizations, and 25 deaths, of which 20 cases occurred among people ≥65 years of age in the epidemic season 2016/2017.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
