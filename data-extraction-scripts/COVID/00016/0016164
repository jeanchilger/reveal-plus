<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009</DATELINE><TITLE>Plant Production of Veterinary Vaccines and Therapeutics</TITLE><BODY>Plant-derived biologicals for use in animal health are becoming an increasingly important target for research into alternative, improved methods for disease control. Although there are no commercial products on the market yet, the development and testing of oral, plant-based vaccines is now beyond the proof-of-principle stage. Vaccines, such as those developed for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, have the potential to stimulate both mucosal and systemic, as well as, lactogenic immunity as has already been seen in target animal trials. Plants are a promising production system, but they must compete with existing vaccines and protein production platforms. In addition, regulatory hurdles will need to be overcome, and industry and public acceptance of the technology are important in establishing successful products.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
