<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-03-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Pathophysiology of Clinical Symptoms in Acute Viral Respiratory Tract Infections</TITLE><BODY>In this article we discuss the pathophysiology of common symptoms of acute viral respiratory infections (e.g., sneezing, nasal discharge, sore throat, cough, muscle pains, malaise, and mood changes). Since clinical symptoms are not sufficient to determine the etiology of viral respiratory tract infections, we believe that the host defense mechanisms are critical for the symptomatology. Consequently, this review of literature is focused on the pathophysiology of respiratory symptoms regardless of their etiology. We assume that despite a high prevalence of symptoms of respiratory infection, their pathogenesis is not widely known. A better understanding of the symptoms’ pathogenesis could improve the quality of care for patients with respiratory tract infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
