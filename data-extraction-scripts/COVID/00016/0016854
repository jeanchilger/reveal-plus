Infrequently, novel or reemergent strains of influenza A virus have caused rapid, severe global pandemics resulting in millions of fatalities. The ability to efficiently and accurately detect and differentiate respiratory viruses is paramount for effective treatment, infection control, and epidemiological surveillance. We evaluated the ability of two FDA-cleared nucleic acid-based tests, the semiautomated respiratory virus nucleic acid test (VRNAT) and the fully automated respiratory virus nucleic acid test SP (RVNAT(SP)) (Nanosphere Inc., Northbrook, IL) to detect influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV A/B) from clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Detection of viral RNA in both tests is based on nucleic acid amplification followed by hybridization to capture probes immobilized on a glass slide. A novel technology utilizing gold nanoparticle-conjugated probes is utilized to detect the presence of captured target DNA. This microarray-based approach to detection has proven to be more sensitive than the traditional culture/direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) method for detecting RSV and influenza viruses in clinical specimens, including the novel 2009 H1N1 strain. Specifically, we report 98.0% sensitivity and 96.5% specificity for the VRNAT compared to culture/DFA. Further, the VRNAT detected virus in an additional 58% of specimens that were culture negative. These data were confirmed using bidirectional sequencing. Evaluation of the fully automated RVNAT(SP), which is built on the same detection technology as the VRNAT but contains an updated processor enabling complete automation, revealed the two tests to be functionally equivalent. Thus, the RVNAT(SP) is a fully automated sample-to-result test capable of reliable detection of select respiratory viruses directly from clinical specimens in 3.5 h.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
