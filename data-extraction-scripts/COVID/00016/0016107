<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-12-17</DATELINE><TITLE>Future Challenges for Vaccinologists</TITLE><BODY>Vaccination is one of the cheapest health-care interventions that have saved more lives than any other drugs or therapies. Due to successful immunization programs we rarely hear about some of the common diseases of the early twentieth century including small pox and polio. Vaccination programs have also helped to increase food production notably poultry, cattle, and milk production due to lower incidence of infectious diseases in farm animals. Though vaccination programs have eradicated several diseases and increased the quality of life there are several diseases that have no effective vaccines. Currently there are no vaccines for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis, AIDS, and parasitic diseases including malaria. Abuse of antibiotics has resulted in the generation of several antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains; hence there is a need to develop novel vaccines for antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Changes in climate is another concern for vaccinologists. Climate change could lead to generation of new strains of infectious microorganisms that would require development of novel vaccines. Use of conventional vaccination strategies to develop vaccines has severe limitations; hence innovative strategies are essential in the development of novel and effective vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
