Live-attenuated measles vaccines are very efficient and safe. Since the availability of a reverse genetic system to manipulate MV genomes and to generate respective recombinant viruses, a considerable number of recombinant viruses has been generated that present antigens of foreign pathogens during MV replication. Thereby, robust humoral and cellular immune responses can be induced, which have shown protective capacity in a substantial number of experiments. For this purpose, the foreign antigen-encoding genes are cloned into additional transcription units of plasmid based full-length MV vaccine strain genomes, which in turn are used to rescue recombinant MV by providing both full-length viral RNA genomes respective anti-genomes together with all protein components of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex after transient transfection of the so-called rescue cells. Infectious centers form among these transfected cells, which allow clonal isolation of single recombinant viruses that are subsequently amplified, characterized in vitro, and then evaluated for their immunogenicity in appropriate preclinical animal models.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
