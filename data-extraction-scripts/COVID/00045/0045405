<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-01-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Mannich bases in medicinal chemistry and drug design</TITLE><BODY>The biological activity of Mannich bases, a structurally heterogeneous class of chemical compounds that are generated from various substrates through the introduction of an aminomethyl function by means of the Mannich reaction, is surveyed, with emphasis on the relationship between structure and biological activity. The review covers extensively the literature reports that have disclosed Mannich bases as anticancer and cytotoxic agents, or compounds with potential antibacterial and antifungal activity in the last decade. The most relevant studies on the activity of Mannich bases as antimycobacterial agents, antimalarials, or antiviral candidates have been included as well. The review contains also a thorough coverage of anticonvulsant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antioxidant activities of Mannich bases. In addition, several minor biological activities of Mannich bases, such as their ability to regulate blood pressure or inhibit platelet aggregation, their antiparasitic and anti-ulcer effects, as well as their use as agents for the treatment of mental disorders have been presented. The review gives in the end a brief overview of the potential of Mannich bases as inhibitors of various enzymes or ligands for several receptors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
