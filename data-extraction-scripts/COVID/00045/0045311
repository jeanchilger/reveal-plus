One day after initial stabilization of a non-ST-elevated anterior myocardial infarction (MI), he sustained an ST-elevated anterior MI. Eight hours after emergency coronary intervention to the culprit lesion, he developed another ST-elevated MI in the inferior territory. Acute inflammation and cytokine storm in the immunopathological phase of SARS may play a role in coronary plague instability. Physicians should be alert to this potentially fatal complication and adopt appropriate vigilant and aggressive management strategies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
