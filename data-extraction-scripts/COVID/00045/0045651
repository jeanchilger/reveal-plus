The antigenicity of the expression products was tested using a number of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies. The polyclonal antisera recognized different sets of epitopes in the 1162-residue sequence. The N-terminal region of one of the two subunits, S2, was recognized by all polyclonal sera and by two monoclonal antibodies. This clearly immunodominant region contains at least two adjacent or overlapping epitopes, one of which has been localized within 18 residues. The epitopes found as antigenic pEX expression products do not coincide with the regions in the S1 subunit that have been found to contain hypervariable sequences. We suggest that these regions constitute conformation dependent neutralization epitopes that cannot be detected in the pEX system. The relevance of our finclings for vaccine development is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
