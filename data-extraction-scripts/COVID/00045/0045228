Chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs were effectively processed in antigen presenting cells in vitro and in vivo and induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation. Mice immunized only once with VP1-GP33 VLPs without adjuvant developed an effective GP33-specific memory T cell response: 70% were fully and 30% partially protected from LCMV infection. Moreover, aggressive growth of tumors expressing GP33 was significantly delayed in these mice in vivo. Therefore, HaPyV VP1-derived VLP harboring CTL epitopes are attractive vaccine candidates for the induction of insert-specific CTL immune response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
