<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-09-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Global animal disease surveillance</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Development and implementation of global animal disease surveillance has been limited by the lack of information systems that enable near real-time data capturing, sharing, analysis, and related decision- and policy-making. The objective of this paper is to describe requirements for global animal disease surveillance, including design and functionality of tools and methods for visualization and analysis of animal disease data. The paper also explores the potential application of techniques for spatial and spatio-temporal analysis on global animal disease surveillance, including for example, landscape genetics, social network analysis, and Bayesian modeling. Finally, highly pathogenic avian influenza data from Denmark and Sweden are used to illustrate the potential application of a novel system (Disease BioPortal) for data sharing, visualization, and analysis for regional and global surveillance efforts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
