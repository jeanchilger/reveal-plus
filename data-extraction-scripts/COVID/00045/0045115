We isolated a highly virulent IBV strain (CK/CH/JS/TAHY) from kidneys of diseased chickens. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene revealed that CK/CH/JS/TAHY clustered with the QX-like type. The S1 gene has 1,620 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of 540 amino acids with typical coronavirus cleavage recognition sites of HRRR. About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 105.5 EID50 exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect. In conclusion, the IBV strain is a virulent avian IBV and that exhibited severe pathogenicity in chickens and is a vaccine candidate to prevent infection by Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV strains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
