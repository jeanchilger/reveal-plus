Obtaining virus genome sequence directly from clinical samples is still a challenging task due to the low load of virus genetic material compared to the host DNA, and to the difficulty to get an accurate genome assembly. Here we introduce a complete sequencing and analyzing protocol called V-ASAP for Virus Amplicon Sequencing Assembly Pipeline. Our protocol is able to generate the viral dominant genome sequence starting from clinical samples. It is based on a multiplex PCR amplicon sequencing coupled with a reference-free analytical pipeline. This protocol was applied to 11 clinical samples infected with coronavirus OC43 (HcoV-OC43), and led to seven complete and two nearly complete genome assemblies. The protocol introduced here is shown to be robust, to produce a reliable sequence, and could be applied to other virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
