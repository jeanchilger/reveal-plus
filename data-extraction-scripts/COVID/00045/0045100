Based on recent data suggesting its role as entheropathogen, a case-control study was conducted between 2013 and 2016 to investigate the association of CanineCV with gastroenteritis in dogs, alone or in combination with other viral pathogens, including canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine distemper virus (CDV). A total of 219 dogs suffering from acute gastroenteritis disorders and 67 controls randomly recruited among healthy dogs or patients presenting without enteric signs were screened by a panel of real-time (RT-)PCR assays for CanineCV, CPV, CCoV and CDV. A high prevalence of viral infections was detected in dogs with gastroenteritis (77.16%), with CPV representing the most frequently detected enteropathogen, followed by CanineCV and CCoV. While CPV and CCoV infections displayed a strong association with occurrence of acute gastroenteritis (p< 0.00001), detection of CanineCV in control dogs (28.35%) occurred with prevalence comparable to that of clinical cases (32.42%), so that its correlation with gastrointestinal disease was not statistically supported (p =0.530988). Different from the clinical cases, where co-infections were frequently observed, all positive samples from the control group contained single infections. Noteworthy, a significant association was calculated between co-infections with CanineCV and occurrence of acute gastroenteritis (p< 0.00001). This study supports the role of CanineCV as a co-pathogen in the development of gastrointestinal disease, mainly acting in synergism with other enteric viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
