Once it was a vibrant fishing and farming community, but today its economy is reliant on tourism. The majority of enterprises provide only a marginal income and most workers are seasonal.

Thus, the net social benefits of pursuing subsistence-level tourism outweigh the limited economic gains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
