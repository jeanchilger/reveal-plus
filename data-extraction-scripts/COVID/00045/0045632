<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Biowarfare Pathogens. Is the Research Flavor Different Than That of Clinically Relevant Pathogens?</TITLE><BODY>Publisher Summary This chapter introduces four chemical warfare agents: bacillus anthracis (anthrax), yersinia pestis (plague), variola major (smallpox), and francesella tularensis (tularemia). Anthrax is a dimorphic bacterium that normally exists as spores. The clinical presentation can be as cutaneous, inhalational or gastrointestinal forms that are fortuitously not transmissible from person to person. The insidious nature of anthrax has both vegetative and spore morphology. The vegetative state, being the growth phase, is typically responsive to most classes of antibiotics, while the spore phase is not. Plague is caused by a bacterium carried by a rodent flea. While current antibiotics are effective against plague, the worry is the possibility of a bioengineered chimeric construct that would be resistant to all classes of antibiotics. Tularemia is a zoonosis that occurs naturally in the United States, with animal transmission to man. Sometimes an insect vector may also be the primary route of infection. It is highly pathogenic and the inhalation of 10 organisms would be adequate for infection. Smallpox is the most feared of all biowarfare pathogens, primarily due to its high transmissibility versus other pathogens whose etiologic affects are episodic.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
