Mild diarrhoea was seen from three to 11 days after inoculation, approximately coincident with faecal virus shedding. Virus was initially isolated from the tonsils on day 3, and then from both small and large intestinal tissues up to 14 days after inoculation. Virus was also isolated from liver and lung. Histological changes were not seen in any tissues, but CCV antigen was detected, using a peroxidase antiperoxidase staining technique, mainly in epithelium overlying gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Virus neutralising antibody was first detected on day 10. Specific anti-CCV IgM was first detected in plasma three days after inoculation and IgG on days 4 to 7. Small amounts of anti-CCV IgG, IgM and IgA were detected in duodenal secretion, but none in bile.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
