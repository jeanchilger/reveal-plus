The TCoV polyprotein gene encoded two open reading frames (ORFs), which are translated into two products, pp1a and pp1ab, the latter being produced via −1 frameshift translation. TCoV polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab were predicted to be processed to 15 non-structure proteins (nsp2–nsp16), with nsp1 missing. ClustalW analysis revealed 88.99% identity and 96.99% similarity for pp1ab between TCoV and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) at the amino acid level. The whole genome consists of 27,749nucleotides for 540 and 27,816nucleotides for ATCC, excluding the poly(A) tail. A total of 13 ORFs were predicted for TCoV. Five subgenomic RNAs were detected from ATCC-infected turkey small intestines by Northern blotting. The whole genome sequence had 86.9% identity between TCoV and IBV, supporting that TCoV is a group 3 coronavirus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
