Evidence was obtained that HEV requires the presence of N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) on the cell surface for agglutination of erythrocytes as has been previously shown for BCV and influenza C virus: (i) Incubation of red blood cells with sialate 9-O-acetylesterase, the receptor-destroying enzyme of influenza C virus, rendered the erythrocytes resistant against agglutination by each of the three viruses; (ii) Human erythrocytes which are resistant to agglutination by HEV acquire receptors for HEV after resialylation with Neu5,9Ac2. Sialylation of red blood cells with limiting amounts of sialic acid indicated that strain JHB/1/66 of influenza C virus requires less Neu5,9Ac2 for agglutination of erythrocytes than the two coronaviruses, both of which were found to be similar in their reactivity with Neu5,9Ac2-containing receptors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
