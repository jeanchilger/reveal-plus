<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter Two Targeting Intramembrane Protein–Protein Interactions: Novel Therapeutic Strategy of Millions Years Old</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Intramembrane protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in transmembrane signal transduction mediated by cell surface receptors and play an important role in health and disease. Recently, receptor-specific modulatory peptides rationally designed using a general platform of transmembrane signaling, the signaling chain homooligomerization (SCHOOL) model, have been proposed to therapeutically target these interactions in a variety of serious diseases with unmet needs including cancer, sepsis, arthritis, retinopathy, and thrombosis. These peptide drug candidates use ligand-independent mechanisms of action (SCHOOL mechanisms) and demonstrate potent efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies surprisingly revealed that in order to modify and/or escape the host immune response, human viruses use similar mechanisms and modulate cell surface receptors by targeting intramembrane PPIs in a ligand-independent manner. Here, I review these intriguing mechanistic similarities and discuss how the viral strategies optimized over a billion years of the coevolution of viruses and their hosts can help to revolutionize drug discovery science and develop new, disruptive therapies. Examples are given.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
