Exploitation of the toxic properties of nanoparticles to bacteria, viruses, and fungi has increased markedly over recent years. Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and their incorporation into other materials have been of particular interest. The potential of nanoparticles to control the formation of biofilms within the oral cavity, as a function of their antimicrobial, anti-adhesive, and delivery capabilities, is coming under close scrutiny. However, optimum formulation of materials at the nanoscale does require innovative physical and chemical approaches.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
