The aim of this work was to evaluate the epidemiology characteristics of respiratory viruses found in children and adults with RTI from July 2009 to June 2012 in southern China. Methods In this work, a total of 14 237 nasopharyngeal swabs (14 237 patients from 25 hospitals) were analyzed, and seven respiratory viruses (influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus, human bocavirus) were detected using PCR/RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Results The demographic characteristics, viral prevalence, age distribution, seasonal distribution, and pathogen spectrum of the patients with RTIs were analyzed. Co-infection was observed in 483 specimens, but it was more common in male patients, inpatients, children, and young adults. It varied by season, being more prevalent in the spring and summer and less so in the winter. Human coronavirus and human bocavirus were the most common pathogens, tending to occur in co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Conclusions This work adds to our knowledge of the epidemiology characteristics of these seven common respiratory viruses among patients with RTI in southern China. The detection of the specific viral causes of infection provides a useful starting point for an understanding of illness attributable to respiratory infection, and might also provide data relevant to the development of prevention strategies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
