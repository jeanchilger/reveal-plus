This outbreak contributed to the students at the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) becoming more involved in promoting health awareness in their communities. This was a cross-sectional study that evaluated students in the clinical phase of medical school. The data were collected by an online questionnaire. The measurements were obtained using a researcher-administered and a self-reported questionnaire that had been previously validated. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. One hundred and thirty-six students participated and showed good awareness regarding the clinical aspects of MERS, such as etiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention. However, 76% of the students were not aware of the mortality rate. Conversely, this study uncovered a low level of awareness in the basic sciences. Interestingly, fifth year medical students were more familiar with the incubation period than final year students (p-value <0.05). Regarding gender differences, more female students were knowledgeable about the incubation period and the possible asymptomatic presentation of the disease than male students (p-value <0.05). However, male students were more aware of the diagnostic tests for MERS than their female counterparts. Medical students were knowledgeable about the clinical aspects of MERS but were lacking background awareness in the basic sciences.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
