From these libraries clones were selected to form a linear map across the entire gene A, the putative viral polymerase gene. This gene is approximately 23 kb in length, considerably larger than earlier estimates. Sequence analysis of the U terminal region of the genome indicates the presence of the 66-nucleotide leader that is found on all mRNAs. Secondary structure analysis of the 5′terminal region suggests that transcription of leader terminates in the region of nucleotide 66. The sequence of the first 2000 nucleotides is very similar to that reported for the closely related JHM strain of MHV and potentially encodes p28, a basic protein thought to be a component of the viral polymerase (L. Soe, C. K. Shieh, S. Baker, M. F. Chang, and M. M. C. Lai, 1987, J. Virol., 61, 3968–3976). Gene A contains two of the consensus sequences found in intergenic regions. One is adjacent to the 5′ leader sequence and the other is upstream from the initiation codon for translation of gene B.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
