To characterize the biocatalytic profiles of the crude enzyme, some effect factors were investigated. It had an apparent optimal pH of 6.0 and an optimal temperature at 55 °C. Most of the metal ions tested and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid showed little effect on the crude enzyme activity except Cu(2+). The enzyme was stable only at pH 6. It was more prone to inactivity at high pH conditions than at low pH conditions. It was stable at temperatures below 55 °C and it will lost 90% GL hydrolytic activity exposed at 70 °C. GL hydrolytic activity declined by 30% compared with the control in aqueous solution (buffer pH 6.0) when pre-equilibrated at 55 °C for 5 days. It indicated that the novel crude GL hydrolase preparation had good biocatalytic ability for selective hydrolysis of one glucuronic acid from GL.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
