Wilson</TITLE><BODY>Abstract According to Jerne’s network hypothesis, the binding site of an anti-idiotypic antibody also represents the internal image of an epitope present on a foreign, or even a self antigen. In recent years, antigen mimicry has been defined at the molecular level for some xeno-antigens. However, until now there has been no demonstration of structural mimicry between a human anti-idiotypic antibody and a self structure. To address this question, we used human IgE as the self structure and a well-defined anti-human IgE mAb (BSW17). We describe the isolation of two anti- idiotypic antibodies specific for the anti-IgE antibody BSW17 from a non-immune human Fab phage display library. Interestingly, these two anti-idiotypic antibodies mimic the same molecular surface region as a previously described IgE peptide mimotope isolated by panning on BSW17, but they cover a much larger epitope on the IgE molecule. Accordingly, immunisation of rabbits with the two anti-idiotypic antibodies induced high-affinity antibodies with the same characteristics as BSW17. Thus, our data demonstrate that it is possible to isolate anti-idiotypic antibodies derived from the human genome without the need for hyperimmunisation, and confirm Jerne’s hypothesis that both foreign antigens and self structures can be mimicked by our own immunoglobulins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
