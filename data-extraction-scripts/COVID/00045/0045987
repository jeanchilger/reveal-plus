The paradigm is to use single-gene knockouts in inbred mouse strains or genetic mapping studies using biparental mouse populations. However, genetic variation among these mouse strains is limited compared with the diversity seen in human populations. To address this disconnect, a multiparental mouse population has been developed to specifically dissect the multigenetic regulation of complex disease traits. The Collaborative Cross (CC) population of recombinant inbred mouse strains is a well-suited systems-genetics tool to identify susceptibility alleles that control viral and microbial infection outcomes and immune responses and to test the promise of personalized medicine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
