Subcellular chemistry and structure can be examined by various forms of microprobe analysis and by special staining methods, including cytochemical, immunocytochemical, and negative staining. Qualitative ultrastructural examination can be augmented by morphometric analysis. Correlative microscopic survey methods can be used as a means of targeting ultrastructural investigations. This article provides an overview of the use of these special techniques in the diagnosis and classification of tumors and other selected pathologic processes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
