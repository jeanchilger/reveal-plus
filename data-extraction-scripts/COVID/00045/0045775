<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2004-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Clinical picture, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in children</TITLE><BODY>Summary Children are susceptible to infection by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) but the clinical picture of SARS is milder than in adults. Teenagers resemble adults in presentation and disease progression and may develop severe illness requiring intensive care and assisted ventilation. Fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leucopaenia, lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are common presenting features. Radiographic findings are non-specific but high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax in clinically suspected cases may be an early diagnostic aid when initial chest radiographs appear normal. The improved reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are critical in the early diagnosis of SARS, with sensitivity approaching 80% in the first 3 days of illness when performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates, the preferred specimens. Absence of seroconversion to SARS-CoV beyond 28 days from disease onset generally excludes the diagnosis. The best treatment strategy for SARS among children remains to be determined. No case fatality has been reported in children and the short- to medium-term outcome appears to be good. The importance of continued monitoring for any long-term complications due to the disease or its empiric treatment, cannot be overemphasised.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
