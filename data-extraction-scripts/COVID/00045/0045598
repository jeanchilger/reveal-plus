<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1998-07-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral pneumonia in children</TITLE><BODY>Viral pneumonia causes a heavy burden on our society. In the United States, more than one million cases of pneumonias afflict children under the age of 5 years, costing hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The majority of these infections are caused by a handful of common viruses. Knowledge of the epidemiology of these viruses combined with new rapid diagnostic techniques will provide faster and more, reliable diagnoses in the future. Although the basic clinical epidemiology of these viruses has been carefully investigated over the last 30 years, new molecular techniques are greatly expanding our understanding of these agents and the diseases they cause. Antigenic and genetic variations are being discovered in many viruses previously thought to be homogeneous. The exact roles and the biological significance of these variations are just beginning to be explored, but already evidence of differences in pathogenicity and immunogenicity has been found in many of these substrains. All of this information clearly will impact the development of future vaccines and antiviral drugs. Effective drugs exist for prophylaxis against influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, and specific therapy exists for influenza A. Ribarivin is approved for use in respiratory synctial virus infections, and it alone or in combination with other agents (eg, IGIV) may be effective in immunocompromised patients, either in preventing the development of pneumonia or in decreasing morbidity and mortality. Many new antiviral agents are being tested and developed, and several are in clinical trials.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
