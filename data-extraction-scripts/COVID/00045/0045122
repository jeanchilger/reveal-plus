In Taiwan, the influenza rapid test, an in vitro diagnostic device (Flu-IVD), only requires documented reviews for market approval by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of Flu-IVDs used in Taiwan. Analytical sensitivity and specificity tests were performed for influenza antigens A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus, A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2) virus, B/Brisbane/60/08 virus, and human coronavirus OC43. A total of seven domestic and 31 imported Flu-IVD samples were collected, of which, 20 samples had inadequate labeling, including those with removed package inserts or incorrect insert information. The analytical sensitivity of Flu-IVDs for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and Flu B was 500–1000 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, and 1000 ng/mL, respectively. For the 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID(50)) label, the average A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 sensitivity for Flu-IVDs was log(10) 5.8 ± 0.5 and log(10) 6.6 ± 0.5 CCID(50)/mL, respectively. As to the specificity test, no product cross-reacted with human coronavirus OC43. This study provides important information on the Flu-IVD regulation status and can thus help the government formulate policies for the regulation of in vitro diagnostic devices in Taiwan.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
