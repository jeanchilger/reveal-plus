The development of transgenic mice expressing HCV proteins and the successful repopulation of SCID/Alb-uPA mice with human hepatocytes provides an important tool for unraveling virus–host interactions in vivo. Several of these mouse models exhibit aspects of HCV-related liver disease. Thus, these in vivo models play an important role to further understand the pathogenesis of HCV infection and to evaluate the pre-clinical safety and efficacy of new antiviral compounds against HCV. This review summarizes the most important mouse models currently used to study HCV pathogenesis and infection. Finally, the perspective of these models for future HCV research as well as the design of novel small animal models is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
