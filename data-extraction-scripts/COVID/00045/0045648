Many species in the seven genera of Polygoneae are traditional and popular medicinal herbs. Anthraquinones and stilbenes are characteristic medicinal compounds of Polygoneae, while other useful constituents, such as alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, volatile oils, tannins, resins, coumarins, and lignans, have also been isolated from Polygoneae species. Among versatile bioactivities of Polygoneae compounds, their effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems and their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, insecticidal, anticancer, and antioxidant activities are highlighted. Interspecific hybridization and the following polyploidization play a major role in Polygoneae diversification. Nuclear ITS and chloroplast DNA sequences are retrieved to resolve the interspecific relationship and reassign some taxa to the appropriate genus. Omics study of Polygoneae is at the budding stage, which will revolutionize the sustainable utilization of Polygoneae medicinal resources.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
