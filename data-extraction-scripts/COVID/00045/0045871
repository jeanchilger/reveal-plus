In this study, we have searched publicly available transcriptomes for sequences similar to viruses of the Nidovirales order. We report two potential nidovirus genomes, a highly divergent 35.9 kb likely complete genome from the California sea hare Aplysia californica, which we assign to a nidovirus named Aplysia abyssovirus 1 (AAbV), and a coronavirus-like 22.3 kb partial genome from the ornamented pygmy frog Microhyla fissipes, which we assign to a nidovirus named Microhyla alphaletovirus 1 (MLeV). AAbV was shown to encode a functional main proteinase, and a translational readthrough signal. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that AAbV represents a new family, proposed here as Abyssoviridae. MLeV represents a sister group to the other known coronaviruses. The importance of MLeV and AAbV for understanding nidovirus evolution, and the origin of terrestrial nidoviruses are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
