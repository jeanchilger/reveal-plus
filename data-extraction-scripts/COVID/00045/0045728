METHODS: The study follows a descriptive, cross-sectional design and uses a self-reported questionnaire. Emergency medical technicians, amounting to 1,020 in all, currently working in firefighting organizations from four South Korean cities (Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, and Ulsan) participated in the study. RESULTS: Disaster risk perception, self-efficacy for disaster, participation experience in disaster education/training, and personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness predicted the disaster response competency of emergency medical technicians in South Korea. CONCLUSION: There is a need for an antidisaster program to enhance the disaster risk perception, self-efficacy, personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness, and the disaster education/training participation rate toward enhancing disaster response competency of emergency medical technicians in South Korea.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
