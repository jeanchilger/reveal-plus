Three of these epitopes are located on the nucleoprotein (N48 amino acids 46 to 60; N272, amino acids 272 to 286; and N321 amino acid 321 to 335), and one on the membrane protein (M196, amino acids 196 to 210). N321, peptide induced the highest T cell response and was recognized by immune miniswine lymphocytes with haplotypes dd, aa , and cc. T lymphocytes from peptide N321-immune miniswine reconstituted the in vitro synthesis of TGEV-specific antibodies by complementing CD4- TGEV-immune cells. This response was directed at least against the three major structural proteins. The synthesized antibodies specific for S protein preferentially recognized discontinous epitopes and neutralized TGEV infectivity. These results show that peptide N321 defines a functional T helper epitope eliciting T cells capable of collaborating with B cells specific for different proteins of TGEV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
