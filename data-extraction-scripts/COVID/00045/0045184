Growth curves showed maximum virus production at multiplicities of infection of 0.1 and 1; maximum titers of intracellular virus occurred at 22–24 hr and of extracellular virus at 26 hr postadsorption. Tube infectivity titers ranged from 109.0–109.5 TCID50/ml and plaque titers from 1010.2–1010.9 y PFU/ml at the time of peak virus production, when no cytopathology was evident. Virus titer dropped rapidly between 26 and 56 hr, coincident with increasing cytopathology. A single precipitin band was observed in immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis between concentrated virus preparations and antiserum to purified 229E. Neuraminidase and hemagglutinin assays were negative. Virus was purified by two procedures: adsorption to and elution from human “0” erythrocytes and CaHPO4 gel followed by equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation, and PEG precipitation followed by equilibrium glycerol/tartrate gradients and rate zonal sucrose or glycerol/tartrate gradients. Final lots of purified virus containing <0.02% of the crude tissue culture proteins had absorption maxima at 256 nm and minima at 241.2 nm and a mean extinction coefficient of E 1cm 1% = 54.3 at 256 nm. The fully corrected sedimentation coefficient for the intact virion was S 20,v 0 = 381 S. PAGE by different techniques revealed seven polypeptides of mean apparent molecular weights between 16,900 and 196,100. Six contained carbohydrate and one contained lipid. Electropherograms of 3H- and 14C-labeled virus were identical to those of stained gels. Two glycoproteins constituting 25% of the virion protein were identified by bromelin digestion as the spike proteins. The density in sucrose and in potassium tartrate was 1.18 g/ml for the virion and 1.15 g/ml for the “despiked” particle.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
