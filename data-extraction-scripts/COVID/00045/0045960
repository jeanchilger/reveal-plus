<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-03-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Nanoparticulate systems as drug carriers: the need</TITLE><BODY>Development of nanoparticles for drug delivery has progressed by leaps and bounds over the last few decades, facilitating the possibility of an efficacious therapy for some fatal diseases. This development has stemmed from either the unsuitable physicochemical characteristics of the existing drug molecules, such as limited solubility and hence poor bioavailability, or the inadequacy of the conventional delivery systems to provide safe and efficient delivery. This chapter focuses on the precise need for the development of these novel nanoparticulate drug carriers and reasons for their popularity with the drug delivery scientists. The text also discusses the various strategies, including different formulation and targeting approaches, which have been adopted to overcome the challenges presented by the inherent properties of the drug molecules. Examples of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems which have already gained market approval have been cited in the discussion, wherever applicable.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
