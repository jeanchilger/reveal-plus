Serum miRNA was gradually considered as molecular markers for disease diagnosis. This study was designed to analyze differential serum miRNAs level in hormone-induced non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (hormone-NOFH) patients. Methods We selected 30 patients with hormone-NOFH as case group, and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited as control group. miRCURYTM LNA miRNA chip and quantitative RT-PCR were used to examine differential miRNAs expression. Correlation assay was performed between miRNAs and NOFH trait. Results We found that 9 miRNAs were upregulated while 3 miRNAs were downregulated in hormone-TOFH patient serum by result of miRNA chip. QRT-PCR assay revealed that the level of miR-423-5p was significantly increased and miR-10a-5p was significantly decreased. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we observed that miR-423-5p serum level is positive association to FHC levels whereas miR-10a-5p has no association with FHC levels. Furthermore, miR-423-5p is negatively correlated to its downstream molecule-adiponectin. Conclusion We report a miRNA profile of hormone-NOFH and provide a new perspective to understand this intricate disease. This novel information suggests the potential roles of miR-423-5p in the diagnosis, prognosis biomarkers, or therapy targets of hormone-NOFH.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
