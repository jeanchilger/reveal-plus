<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-07-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Phylogeny of Viruses</TITLE><BODY>Biological species, including viruses, change through generations and over time in the process known as evolution. Viruses may evolve at high, uneven, and fluctuating rates among genome sites. The accumulated changes, through either mutation or recombination with other species, are first fixed in the genome of successful individuals that give rise to genetic lineages. The relationship between biological lineages related by common descent is called ‘phylogeny’. For inferring phylogeny, the differences between aligned sequences of genomes and proteins are quantified and depicted in the form of a tree, in which contemporary species and their intermediate and common ancestors occupy, respectively, the terminal nodes, internal nodes, and the root. The tree is characterized by a topology, length of branches, shape, and the root position. A complex mathematical apparatus has been developed for phylogeny inference that can evaluate inter-species differences, facilitate tree building and comparison of trees, and assess the fit between data and tree through, typically, computationally intensive calculations. A reconstructed tree is an approximation of the true phylogeny that practically remains unknown. The phylogenetic analysis is used in applied and fundamental virus research, including epidemiology, diagnostics, forensic studies, phylogeography, evolutionary studies, and virus taxonomy. It can provide an evolutionary perspective on variation of any trait that can be measured for a group of viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
