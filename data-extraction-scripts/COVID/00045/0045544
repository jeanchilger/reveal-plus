<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-04-11</DATELINE><TITLE>Viruses and Viral Diseases</TITLE><BODY>More than 40 compounds have been formally licensed for clinical use as antiviral drugs, and half of these are used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The others have been approved for the therapy of herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV)), hepadnavirus (hepatitis B virus (HBV)), hepacivirus (hepatitis C virus (HCV)), and myxovirus (influenza, respiratory synctural virus (RSV)) infections. New compounds are in clinical development or under preclinical evaluation, and, again, half of these target HIV infections. Yet, quite a number of important viral pathogens (i.e., human papilloma virus (HPV), HCV, hemorrhagic fever viruses) remain in need of effective and/or improved antiviral therapies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
