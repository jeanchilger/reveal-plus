Of the 177 faecal samples, 27.1% were positive for Giardia cysts (immunofluorescence microscopy) and 55.4% for Cryptosporidium oocysts (phase-contrast microscopy). Positive samples were characterized by nested PCR for Giardia, 83.3% (triosephosphate isomerase; tpi) and 89.6% (β-giardin; bg) were positive, while the Cryptosporidium nested PCR returned 92.5% (60-kDa glycoprotein) positive results. Sequence analysis revealed one assemblage A-positive sample and 30 (bg) respectively 29 (tpi) assemblage E-positive samples for G. intestinalis. For C. parvum four subtypes within the IIa family (IIaA15G2R1, n = 29; IIaA19G2R2, n = 3; IIaA21G2R1, n = 2; IIaA14G1R1, n = 1) could be differentiated. Validation of two immunochromatographic point-of-care tests resulted in a sensitivity of 29.2% and 77.6%; a specificity of 98.4% and 91.1% for the detection of Giardia intestinalis and Cryptosporidium parvum, respectively. Results confirm the widespread occurrence of both protozoa in diarrhoeic calves in Austria.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
