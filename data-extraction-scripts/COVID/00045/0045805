<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-09-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Market Size and Economics for Biosensors</TITLE><BODY>This chapter classifies biosensors into three types: Single use, Intermittent use, and Continuous use. The major resistance that is apparent for the development of biosensors is the lack of mass markets barring a few exceptional cases such as glucose monitoring for diabetes. With a view to a commercial profit, this places a serious hindrance on investment in biosensor technologies. In a program solicitation for proposals, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has attempted to address some of the perceived obstacles that biosensor development is facing. Some of these perceived obstacles include robustness under anticipated manufacturing schemes; quantification of limits of detection, calibration, and interferences; verification of accuracy; miniaturization; manufacture; and human-in-the-loop and closed loop adaptive feedback.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
