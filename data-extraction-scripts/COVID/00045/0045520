The major recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, site of care, and prevention are also summarized. In general, the guideline meets the criteria of evaluation of practice guidelines, although the methods used for the literature search are not adequately described. The guideline was not developed with the input from primary care providers; however, it is appropriate for NPs who work in a variety of settings, including primary care.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
