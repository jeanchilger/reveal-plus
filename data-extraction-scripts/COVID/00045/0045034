The order is unified by nidoviruses sharing intermediate (12.7kb) to very long (31.7kb) (+) ssRNA genomes, each possessing a long 5′-terminal gene encoding overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b reading frames that contain a diversity of functionally related enzymes and that are translated in toto using a −1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism, as well as by semiconserved strategies for transcribing a nested set of 3′-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs that translate the viral proteins. The nidovirus that is most important to an aquaculture species is yellow head virus (YHV), which causes disease in shrimp farmed throughout the Eastern Hemisphere and is classified in the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae. Fathead minnow nidovirus, genus Bafinivirus, subfamily Torovirinae, family Coronaviridae, also causes disease in minnows grown for the baitfish industry in the United States. Virions similar in morphology to okaviruses and bafiniviruses have also been detected in several crab species. Of these, however, only Eriocheir sinensis ronivirus, which causes disease in the Chinese mitten crab, an important freshwater aquaculture species in China, has been shown to possess a ~22kb ssRNA genome that supports its being a nidovirus, but its taxonomic classification awaits genome sequence analysis. This chapter provides an overview of the structure, replication and biology of these viruses with a particular focus on YHV disease characteristics, diagnostic methods and disease prevention strategies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
