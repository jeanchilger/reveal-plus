The sensing platform was established based on fluorescence enhancement of guanine (G)-rich and the phenomenon in the process of two silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) forming a nanoclusters dimer. The probe (AgNCs/G) utilized for HIV-1 detection adopted an effective conformation based on enhancement effect of G-rich sequence (at 500 nm ex / 565 nm em) while the probe (AgNCs/AgNCs) for HIV-2 generated fluorescence signals (at 580 nm ex / 630 nm em) with bright fluorescence only in nanoclusters dimer. The nanoprobe shows high selectivity for multiplexed analysis of target DNA with a detection limit of 11 pM, respectively. Moreover, this is the first time to use the affectivity of fluorescent AgNCs and two HIV DNAs simultaneous detection integrated into a novel method, which shows a great promise in biomedical research and early clinical diagnosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
