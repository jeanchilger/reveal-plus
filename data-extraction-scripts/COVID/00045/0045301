We performed a retrospective study reviewing results of patients tested for respiratory viruses following introduction of a two-stage testing algorithm incorporating an initial screen with Sofia® immunoassay then secondary Biofire Filmarray®, and compared to a period when only Filmarray® was used. Of 2976 testing episodes, 1814 underwent initial Sofia® then follow-up FilmArray®. A diagnosis of influenza was made by Sofia® in 282 patients, and by FilmArray® in an additional 163 (median time to result 1.12hours versus 3.46hours, P <0.001). Significantly more patients received their diagnosis within 90minutes in winter despite testing more samples (11.1% versus 3.4%, P <0.001), and approximately $36,000 was saved. An algorithmic approach to respiratory viral diagnosis can combine the advantages of accuracy and speed and be cost saving.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
