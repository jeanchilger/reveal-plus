In our cohort of 110 pediatric patients, 30 had allo-LS (27.3%), 18 with ideopathic pneumonia syndrome and 12 with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Multivariate analysis showed that respiratory viral infection early after HSCT is an important predictor for the development of allo-LS (P <.0001). This was true for all viruses tested. In multivariate analysis, allo-LS was the only predictor for higher mortality (P = .04). Paradoxically, prolonged administration of immunosuppressive agents because of acute graft-versus-host disease had a protective effect on the development of allo-LS (P = .004). We hypothesize that early infection of the respiratory tract with a common cold virus makes the lungs a target for alloimmunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
