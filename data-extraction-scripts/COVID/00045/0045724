Two patients who recently 28 underwent lung lobectomies for adenocarcinoma were retrospectively found to have had 29 COVID-19 at the time of surgery. These two cases thus provide important first 30 opportunities to study the pathology of COVID-19. Pathologic examinations revealed 31 that, apart from the tumors, the lungs of both patients exhibited edema, proteinaceous 32 exudate, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with patchy inflammatory cellular 33 infiltration, and multinucleated giant cells. Hyaline membranes were not prominent. 34 Since both patients did not exhibit symptoms of pneumonia at the time of surgery, these 35 changes likely represent an early phase of the lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia. 36 37 Key words: coronavirus; COVID-19 pneumonia, pathology; SARS-CoV-2 38 39 40&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
