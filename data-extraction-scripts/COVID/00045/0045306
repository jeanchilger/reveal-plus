(1987) reported the isolation of a T-lymphotropic virus possessing thecharacteristics of a lentivirus from pet cats in Davis, California. From the first report onwards, it was evident that in causing an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in cats, the virus was of substantial veterinary importance. It shares many physical and biochemical properties with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and was therefore named feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). This article reviews recent knowledge of the aetiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical signs, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment options of FIV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
