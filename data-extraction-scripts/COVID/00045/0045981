Animal models are a core component of biological research and play a critical role in numerous aspects of studying human disease, including through the creation of transgenic animals, but they can also be used to research diseases that naturally occur within animal populations. They also present disadvantages and unique biosafety issues.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
