We synthetically analyzed the microsatellites in whole-genome and terminal regions of 219 Ebolavirus genomes from five species. The Ebolavirus sequences were observed with small intraspecies variations and large interspecific variations, especially in the terminal non-coding regions. Only five conserved microsatellites were detected in the complete genomes, and four of them which well base-paired to help forming conserved stem-loop structures mainly appeared in the terminal non-coding regions. These results suggest that the conserved microsatellites may be evolutionary selected to form conserved secondary structures in 5′, 3′ terminals of Ebolavirus genomes. It may help to understand the biological significance of microsatellites in Ebolavirus and also other virus genomes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
