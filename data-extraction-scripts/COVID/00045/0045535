An informative portion of the genome (3.4kb at the 3′ end) was generated for four NoV strains. In the capsid protein VP1 region, strains 63.15/2015/ITA and FD53/2007/ITA were genetically related to the canine GVI.2 strain C33/Viseu/2007/PRT (97.4–98.6% nt and 90.3–98.6% aa). Strain FD210/2007/ITA displayed the highest identity to the GVI.1 canine strain Bari/91/2007/ITA (88.0% nt and 95.0% aa). Strain 5010/2009/ITA displayed only 66.6–67.6% nt and 75.5–81.6% aa identities to the GVI.1 canine strains FD210/2007/ITA and Bari/91/2007/ITA and the GVI feline strain M49-1/2012/JPN. Identity to the other canine/feline NoVs strains in the VP1 was lower than 67.6% nt and 62.7% aa. Based on the full-length VP1 amino acid sequence and the criteria proposed for distinction of NoV genotypes, the canine NoV 5010/2009/ITA could represent the prototype of a third GVI genotype, thus providing further evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of NoVs in carnivores.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
