Because of different treatment options for the parasites, confirmation of presence of one or both pathogens is necessary. The PCR based assays are suitable for differential diagnosis. We evaluated the performance of Small Animal Diarrhoea panel, a multiplexed-tandem real-time PCR (MT-PCR) assay, that detects DNA of both G. intestinalis and T. foetus. The sensitivity and specificity were compared to reference real-time PCR assays using 105 faecal samples, 39.05% (n = 41) positive for G. intestinalis and 30.48% (n = 32) were positive for T. foetus. The faecal samples positive for T. foetus had a high proportion of late amplifiers, determined by an arbitrary threshold of Ct-values > 35. On the other hand, only one G. intestinalis positive sample was considered a late amplifier. For G. intestinalis DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 95.1% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity. For T. foetus DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 41.9% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity. To evaluate the interlaboratory reproducibility of the MT-PCR assay, results were compared in two different laboratories and found to be in a very good agreement (Kappa = 0.9). Further analysis of the DNA using conventional PCR determined presence of G. intestinalis Assemblage F and T. foetus genotype ‘feline’. In conclusion, the MT-PCR Small Animal Diarrhoea panel had a good and poor performance against reference assays for G. intestinalis and T. foetus, respectively. The assay is suitable for detection and differential diagnosis of G. intestinalis and moderate to high burdens of T. foetus in small animal clinical practice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
