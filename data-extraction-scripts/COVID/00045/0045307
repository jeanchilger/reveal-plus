The emergence of new virus diseases</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The sudden appearance of apparently new viruses with pathogenic potential is of fundamental importance in medical microbiology and a constant threat to humans and animals. The emergence of a “new” pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown. This review tries to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of “new” viruses of mammals, such as the simian, human and feline lentiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline parvoviruses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. A particular emphasis will be put on the genetic mechanisms that might have taken place and that might have been responsible for their sudden appearance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
