The virus is prevalent in about 30 countries. Clinical symptoms of infection commonly include fever, myalgia, and hemorrhages. Levels of liver enzymes are raised, and bleeding markers are often increased. A role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis has been suggested, and CCHFV employs a range of passive and active mechanisms to avoid induction of the antiviral type I interferons. Here, we review the most recent findings on the molecular pathogenesis and the interaction of CCHFV with the type I interferon and cytokine responses and discuss implications for pathogenesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
