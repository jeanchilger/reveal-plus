Viral proteomics has included the analysis of viral particles to determine all proteins that compose the infectious virus, the examination of cellular proteins associated with a single viral protein in the hopes of determining all the functions of that viral protein, or the determination of cellular proteins induced or altered during a particular disease state. Viral particles of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV-8) have been recently examined. During the herpesviral replicative cycle, different viral particles are formed. For HCMV, this includes mature, infectious virions, noninfectious enveloped particles, and dense bodies. A proteome database of B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), before and after transformation, has been developed to identify the cellular mechanisms of virus-induced immortalization. 2DE is used to first separate proteins based on their relative charge (pI) and then based on their molecular weight. Proteomic analysis has provided a unique tool for the identification of diagnostic biomarkers, evaluation of disease progression, and drug development. It is also an important approach for clinical diagnostics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
