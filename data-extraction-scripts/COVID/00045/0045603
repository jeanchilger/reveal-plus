Vectors included replication competent CTN-Gluc, CTN/GQ333R-Gluc, in which the amino acid in position 333 of glycoprotein was mutated from glutamine (Q) to arginine (R), and replication constrained CTNΔG-Gluc, in which the glycoprotein encoding gene (G) was deleted. The growth of recombinant RVs in transfected cells was confirmed through biochemical assays of Gluc activities. Gluc expression in recombinant CTNΔG-Gluc virus was highest while that in CTN/GQ333R-Gluc virus was lowest. The optimal time to harvest recombinant RVs was determined and the function of pathogenic and nonpathogenic rabies glycoprotein in virus recovery was examined. The addition of glycoprotein was slightly beneficial for virus recovery and the titer of rescued virus was lowered even when the amino acid in G333 position of glycoprotein was mutated from nonpathogenic Gln to pathogenic Arg. Conclusions: Viral vectors based on a human rabies vaccine strain CTN181 were successful. Gluc was useful as an in vitro gene marker for monitoring the growth of recombinant RVs iteratively in cell culture.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
