Medical reports suggest that a direct contact with the secretion or respiratory droplets from a patient through a short distance is very likely to be the possible way of transmitting the disease. World Health Organization (WHO), hence, has advised international travellers to avoid visiting several regions that have the most number of SARS cases, including Hong Kong. Since then, the number of hotel guests has largely dropped to a level that Hong Kong has never experienced before. As a totally new experience to the hotel industry in Hong Kong and elsewhere, hoteliers basically do not have enough knowledge to respond to epidemic crisis. In view of the lack of published articles in the hospitality literature that examine the issue, this paper investigates the impact of the SARS outbreak on the hotel industry in Hong Kong. In addition, this paper addresses the issue of SARS crisis management in risk identification, assessment and alleviation. The paper is expected to benefit the entire hotel industry from better understanding and planning to face the mysterious illness.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
