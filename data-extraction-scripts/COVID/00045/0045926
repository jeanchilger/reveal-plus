Successive steps in entry include binding to receptors, endocytosis, passage through one or more membranes, targeting to specific sites within the cell, and uncoating of the genome. For some viruses, the molecular interactions are known in great detail. However, as more viruses are analyzed, and as the focus shifts from tissue culture to in vivo experiments, it is evident that viruses display considerable redundancy and flexibility in receptor usage, endocytic mechanism, location of penetration, and uncoating mechanism. For many viruses, the picture is still elusive because the interactions that they engage in rely on sophisticated adaptation to complex cellular functions and defense mechanisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
