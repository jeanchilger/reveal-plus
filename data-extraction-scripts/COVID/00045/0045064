Besides causing clinical symptoms, a potential role of infection in the development of the asthma syndrome later in life has also been suggested. However, whether bacterial and viral infections unmask host factors in children at risk of asthma or whether they directly cause asthma remains unclear; both viewpoints could be justified, but the underlying mechanisms are complex and poorly understood. Recently, the role of the bacterial microbiome has been emphasised. But data are still sparse and future studies are needed for definitive conclusions to be made. In this Review, we discuss present knowledge of viruses and bacteria that infect and colonise the respiratory tract and mucosal surfaces, including their timepoint of action, host factors related to infection, and their effect on childhood asthma. Childhood asthma could be the result of a combination of altered host susceptibility and infectious agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
