Three further pigs (group 2) received PRRSV alone, two (group 3) received PRV alone, and two (group 4) remained as uninfected controls. Despite the admittedly small numbers of animals, the experiment appeared to throw light on aspects of synergy. Thus, the group 1 pigs showed severe neurological signs characterized by ataxia and muscular tremors. Total cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were increased in all PRRSV-infected pigs, and PRRSV antigen was detected in the alveolar macrophages. Total cell numbers in the cerebrospinal fluid of group 1 pigs were considerably greater than those demonstrated in group 3, but no PRV antigen was found. Pigs of groups 1 and 2 showed pulmonary lesions, characterized by interstitial pneumonia and PRRSV antigen immunolabelling. Non-suppurative encephalitis was found in five of the six pigs of groups 1 and 3. In particular, one group 1 animal had severe necrotizing encephalitis with intranuclear inclusion bodies and associated immunolabelling of PRV antigen. The other three group 1 pigs had prominent malacic lesions, with macrophages. These neuropathological findings strongly suggested that PRRSV infection in pigs enhances the severity of brain lesions caused PRV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
