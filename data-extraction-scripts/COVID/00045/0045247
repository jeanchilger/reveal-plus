<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-10-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): Impact on Saudi Arabia, 2015</TITLE><BODY>Middle East respiratory syndrome is the acute respiratory syndrome caused by betacoronavirus MERS-CoV. The first case of this disease was reported from Saudi Arabia in 2012. This virus is lethal and is a close relative of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is responsible for more than 3000 deaths in 2002–2003. According to Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. The number of new cases is 457 in 2015. Riyadh has the highest number of reports in comparison to the other cities. According to this report, males are more susceptible than female, especially after the age of 40. Because of the awareness and early diagnosis the incidence is falling gradually. The pre-existence of another disease like cancer or diabetic etc. boosts the infection. MERS is a zoonotic disease and human to human transmission is low. The MERS-CoV is a RNA virus with protein envelope. On the outer surface, virus has spike like glycoprotein which is responsible for the attachment and entrance inside host cells. There is no specific treatment for the MERS-CoV till now, but drugs are in pipeline which bind with the spike glycoprotein and inhibit its entrance host cells. MERS-CoV and SAR-CoV are from the same genus, so it was thought that the drugs which inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV can also inhibit the growth of MERS-CoV but those drugs are not completely inhibiting virus activity. Until we don’t have proper structure and the treatment of MERS-CoV, We should take precautions, especially the health care workers, Camel owners and Pilgrims during Hajj and Umrah, because they are at a higher risk of getting infected.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
