<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-01-01</DATELINE><TITLE>5′-Fluoro-5′-deoxyaristeromycin</TITLE><BODY>5′-Fluoro-5′-deoxyaristeromycin (2) has been prepared via a Mitsunobu coupling of (1S,2S,3R,4S)-2,3-(cyclopentylidenedioxy)-4-fluoromethylcyclopentan-1-ol with N6-bis-boc protected adenine. This procedure is adaptable to preparing a number of 5′-fluoro-5′-deoxycarbocyclic nucleoside analogs with diversity in the heterocyclic base. Antiviral analysis found promising activity for 2 towards measles but no other viruses. No cytotoxicity was observed for 2.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
