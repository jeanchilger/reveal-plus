There was very high nucleotide and amino acid identity between canine strain RV198/95 and other canine strains, and to the human strain HCR3A. Strain RV52/96, however, was found to have about 95% identity to the G3 serotype canine strains K9, A79-10 and CU-1 and 96% identity to strain RV198/95 and to the simian strain RRV. Therefore both of the canine strains belong to the G3 serotype. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of the VP7 variable regions revealed that RV52/96 possesses amino acid substitutions uncommon to the other canine isolates. In addition, strain RV52/96 exhibited a nucleotide divergence greater than 16% from all the other canine strains studied; however, it revealed the closest identity (90.4%) to the simian strain RRV. With only a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis allowed clear differentiation of the G3 rotaviruses on the basis of the species of origin. The nucleotide and amino acid variations observed in strain RV52/96 could account for the existence of a canine rotavirus G3 sub-type.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
