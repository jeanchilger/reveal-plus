<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-26</DATELINE><TITLE>The Aircraft Cabin Environment</TITLE><BODY>Travel by air is a safe means of transport, but from the physiologic point of view it is a means of putting people at risk as well as a potential means of spreading infectious disease. Atmospheric pressure falls with altitude and above about 10,000 feet, blood desaturation leads to hypoxia. The aircraft cabin is pressurized to maintain an effective altitude below 8000 feet, which provides adequate protection for healthy travelers. Those individuals with cardiopulmonary impairment or other conditions affecting fitness to travel should seek advice from the airline in consultation with their medical provider. People are the primary source of microorganisms in aircraft cabins and are the most important reservoirs of infectious agents on aircraft. Recirculated cabin air is filtered to remove microorganisms, but this does not prevent person-to-person spread of infectious disease in vulnerable people. The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produce guidelines; and people with febrile illnesses should postpone air travel.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
