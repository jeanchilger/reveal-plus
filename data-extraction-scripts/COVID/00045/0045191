<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-10-31</DATELINE><TITLE>CEACAMs: their role in physiology and pathophysiology</TITLE><BODY>Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) belong to a group of mammalian immunoglobulin-related glycoproteins. They are involved in cell–cell recognition and modulate cellular processes that range from the shaping of tissue architecture and neovascularization to the regulation of insulin homeostasis and T-cell proliferation. CEACAMs have also been identified as receptors for host-specific viruses and bacteria in mice and humans, respectively, making these proteins an interesting example of pathogen–host co-evolution. Forward and reverse genetics in the mouse now provide powerful novel models to elucidate the action of CEACAM family members in vivo.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
