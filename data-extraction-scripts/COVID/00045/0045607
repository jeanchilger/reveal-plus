In the previous chapter, we have delineated a series of techniques for designing and developing polymeric vectors as nonviral carriers. Based on what we have discussed, this chapter will introduce how the delivery performance and versatility of polymeric vectors can be further enhanced by using cyclodextrins (CDs). Over the years, CDs have shown promising application potential in different areas, ranging from controlled drug release to chiral separation of basic drugs. These applications are largely mediated by the ability of CDs to undergo host–guest inclusion complexation. Upon incorporation of CDs into the design of a polymeric vector, not only can the flexibility of the design be increased, but the development of a multifunctional carrier for genetic manipulation can also be facilitated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
