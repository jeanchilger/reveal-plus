Human models have provided direct evidence that RV infection is capable of exacerbating chronic respiratory diseases and identified immunological processes that correlate with clinical disease outcomes. Mice are the most commonly used nonhuman experimental RV infection model. Although semipermissive, under defined experimental conditions sufficient replication occurs to induce host immune responses that recapitulate immunity and disease during human infection. The capacity to use genetically modified mouse strains and drug interventions has shown the mouse model to be an invaluable research tool defining causal relationships between host immunity and disease and supporting development of new treatments. Used in combination the insights achieved from human and animal experimental infection models provide complementary insights into RV biology and yield novel therapeutic options to reduce the burden of RV-induced disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
