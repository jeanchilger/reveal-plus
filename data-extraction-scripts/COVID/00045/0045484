Sudden outburst of Nipah virus (NiV) has raised serious question about their instant management using conventional medication and diagnostic measures. A coherent strategy with versatility and comprehensive perspective to confront the rising distress could perhaps be effectuated by implementation of nanotechnology. But in concurrent to resourceful and precise execution of nano-based medication, there is an ultimate need of concrete understanding of the NIV pathogenesis. Moreover, to amplify the effectiveness of nano-based approach in a conquest against NiV, a list of developed nanosystem with antiviral activity is also a prerequisite. Therefore the present review provides a meticulous cognizance of cellular and molecular pathogenesis of NiV. Conventional as well several nano-based diagnosis experimentations against viruses have been discussed. Lastly, potential efficacy of different forms of nano-based systems as convenient means to shield mankind against NiV has also been introduced.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
