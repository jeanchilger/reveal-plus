Methods Outpatient records for acute upper respiratory infections (ICD9 CM codes: 460, 462, 463,464, 465.9 and 487) in a randomly selected sample (n=39,766 children in 2005) was used to estimate the cumulative relative risks (RR) associated with average temperature lasting for 8 days (lag 0–7 days), air pollutants (NO2, O3 and PM2.5) lasting for 6 days (lag 0–5 days), and virus-specific positive isolation rate lasting for 11 days (lag 0–10 days) using distributed lag non-linear models after controlling for relative humidity, wind speed, day of week, holiday effects and long-term trend. Results Average temperature of 33°C was associated with the lowest risk for outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections. Relative to 33°C, cumulative 8-day RR was highest at 15°C of ambient average temperature [RR=1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.78, 2.11]. With the first quartile as reference, cumulative 6-day RRs were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.29) for NO2, 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.06) for O3, and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.03) for PM2.5 at the 95th percentile. Per-standard deviation (SD) increase of virus-specific isolation rate for influenza type A (SD=13.2%), type B (SD=8.76%), and adenoviruses (SD=5.25%) revealed statistical significance for overall 11-day RRs of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), 1.05 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.06) and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.05), respectively. Conclusions Current study suggested a positive association between outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory infections and ambient environment factors, including average temperature, air pollutants, and circulating respiratory viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
