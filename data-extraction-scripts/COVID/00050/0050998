The analytic sensitivity of these original primers were compared with primers defined in the N gene and described previously. The results show that 0.05 TCID50 of HCoV-229E and 0.01 TCID50 of HCoV-OC43 can be detected by this molecular method using the original method. Detection of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in clinical specimens is possible using this method: 348 respiratory specimens (202 sputum and 146 nasal aspirates) were tested with this RT-PCR-hybridization and 12 human coronavirus are detected (3%). The method could provide a useful tool for demonstrating the role of human coronavirus in infections of the respiratory tract.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
