Patients are frequently treated with antibiotics although ARI are most commonly caused by virus, strengthening the need for improved diagnostic methods. Objectives Detect viral and bacterial RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from children aged 6–23 months with ARI using nCounter. Study design A custom-designed nCounter probeset containing viral and bacterial targets was tested in NPA of ARI patients. Results Initially, spiked control viral RNAs were detectable in ≥6.25ng input RNA, indicating absence of inhibitors in NPA. nCounter applied to a larger NPA sample (n =61) enabled the multiplex detection of different pathogens: RNA viruses Parainfluenza virus (PIV 1–3) and RSV A-B in 21%, Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 5%, Bocavirus (BoV), CoV, Influenza virus (IV) A in 3% and, Rhinovirus (RV) in 2% of samples, respectively. RSV A-B was confirmed by Real Time PCR (86.2–96.9% agreement). DNA virus (AV) was detected at RNA level, reflecting viral replication, in 10% of samples. Bacterial transcripts from Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were detected in 77, 69, 26, 8, 3 and 2% of samples, respectively. Conclusion nCounter is robust and sensitive for the simultaneous detection of viral (both RNA and DNA) and bacterial transcripts in NPA with low RNA input (<10ng). This medium-throughput technique will increase our understanding of ARI pathogenesis and may provide an evidence-based approach for the targeted and rational use of antibiotics in pediatric ARI.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
