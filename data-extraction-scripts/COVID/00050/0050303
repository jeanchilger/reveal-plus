Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with specificities for leukocyte subsets and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens were used to characterize IFNα producer cells. The production of IFNα was found to be a function of non-phagocytic, non-adherent, non-T, non-B, CD4+ (and to a lesser extent CD8+) MHC-class-II-positive cells. Furthermore, addition of anti-MHC (class II) mAb during PBMC incubation with virus-infected cells reduced IFN yields, suggesting that masking of these surface antigens alters PBMC responsiveness to IFN induction.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
