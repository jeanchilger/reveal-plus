Phosphorylation of Akt occurs early during JUNV infection of Vero cells and is blocked by the PI3K inhibitor, Ly294002. Infection of cells with UV-irradiated JUNV redeemed the pattern of stimulation observed for infectious virus indicating that an early stage of multiplication cycle would be enough to trigger activation. Treatment of cells with chlorpromazine abrogated phosphorylation of Akt upon JUNV infection suggesting virus internalization as responsible for activation. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by Ly294002 impaired viral protein synthesis and expression leading to a reduced infectious virus yield without blocking the onset of persistent stage of infection. This impairment is linked to a reduced amount of virus bound to cells probably due to a blockage on the recycling of transferrin cell-receptor, employed by the virus to adsorb to the cell surface. Early Akt activation was also observed in BHK-21 and A549 JUNV infected cells suggesting an important role of PI3K/Akt signalling in JUNV multiplication in vitro.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
