Although these exacerbations are associated with several types of viruses, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are associated with the vast majority of disease exacerbations. Due to the lack of an animal species that is naturally permissive for HRVs to use as a facile model system, and the limitations associated with animal models of asthma and COPD, studies of controlled experimental infection of humans with HRVs have been used and conducted safely for decades. This review discusses how these experimental infection studies with HRVs have provided a means of understanding the pathophysiology underlying virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and COPD with the goal of developing agents for their prevention and treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
