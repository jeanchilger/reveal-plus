Carcasses were stored in a cold room at 4°C. After 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24h of storage, necropsies were carried out. Trachea, lung, kidney and rectum were collected for virus isolation by tracheal organ culture (TOC) or embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), and detection by nested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IBV was detected by RT-PCR at all sampling times, except for 1 and 6h of storage in kidney and 9h of storage in kidney and rectum. For ECE, isolation was obtained at all sampling points, except at 1 and 24h of storage in lungs. Isolation by tracheal organ cultures was less successful, except from rectum. In addition to sampling for virus, tracheal washes were collected from each carcass to measure the ability to detect local antibodies after storage. Levels of IgA in tracheal washes remained high for up to 9h of storage, suggesting that accurate sampling for research purposes when required must be carried out within this time.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
