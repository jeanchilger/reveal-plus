The samples collected were: lungs, tonsils, lymph nodes (mediastinal, mesenteric, inguinal and submandibular), pancreas, spleen, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, ileum and stomach. A total of six primary antibodies anti-CD3, anti-CD79α, Mac 387, anti-lysozyme, anti-CD45RA (3C3/9) and anti-SLA-II-DQ (BL2H5) were used with a standard avidin–biotin peroxidase (ABC) method. Anti-CD3 and anti-CD79α mAb-reacted, respectively with cells located in T cell areas and B cell areas. Mac 387 recognised circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes, while anti-lysozyme-stained resident macrophages in all tissues. 3C3/9 and BL2H5, were assessed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues for the first time. 3C3/9 identified B lymphocytes, in primary follicles and mantle zones, a subpopulation of T cells, especially located in the marginal zone of the spleen and a variable number of immunoblasts, in the germinal centres. BL2H5 reacted with B cells in the mantle zones of the follicles of lymphoid tissues, with dendritic and interdigitating cells in all studied lymphoid tissues and with a variable number of resting and activated T cells in the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALs), marginal zone and red pulp of the spleen. Furthermore, it stained Kupffer and perivascular macrophages in the liver This study represents a detailed histological study of the distribution of the most important subpopulations of immune system cells in conventional, healthy pigs. In our view, these tools should be useful for future comparative studies in disease conditions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
