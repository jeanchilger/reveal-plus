In this study, RNA aptamers against SCV NTPase/Helicase (nsP10) were isolated from RNA library containing random sequences of 40 nts using in vitro selection technique. Nucleotide sequences of enriched RNA aptamer pool (ES15 RNA) contain AG-rich conserved sequence of 10–11 nucleotides [AAAGGR(G)GAAG; R, purine base] and/or additional sequence of 5 nucleotides [GAAAG], which mainly reside at the loop region in all the predicted secondary structures. Isolated RNAs were observed to efficiently inhibit double-stranded DNA unwinding activity of the helicase by up to ∼85% with an IC50 value of 1.2nM but show a slight effect on ATPase activity of the protein in the presence of cofactor, poly (rU). These results suggest that the pool of selected aptamers might be potentially useful as anti-SCV agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
