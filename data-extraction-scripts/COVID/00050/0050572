The disease is characterized by diarrhea and dehydration causing mortality and growth retardation. In the last few decades, only classical PEDV was reported sporadically in Europe, but in 2014 outbreaks of PEDV were described in Germany. Phylogenetic analysis showed a very high nucleotide similarity with a variant of PEDV that was isolated in the US in January 2014. The epidemiological situation of PEDV infections in the Netherlands in 2014 was unknown and a seroprevalence study in swine was performed. In total, 838 blood samples from sows from 267 farms and 101 samples from wild boars were collected from May till November 2014 and tested for antibodies against PEDV by ELISA. The apparent herd prevalence of 0.75% suggests that PEDV was not circulating on a large scale in the Netherlands at this time. However, in November 2014 a clinical outbreak of PEDV was diagnosed in a fattener farm by PCR testing. This was the first confirmed PEDV outbreak since the early nineties. Sequence analyses showed that the viruses isolated in 2014 and 2015 in the Netherlands cluster with recently found European G1b strains. This suggests a one event introduction of PEDV G1b strains in Europe in 2014, which made the Netherlands and other European countries endemic for this type of strains since then.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
