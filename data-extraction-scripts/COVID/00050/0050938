While partially compensatory for each other, isoform-specific intracellular distribution, cell-type expression patterns, and regulatory mechanisms suggest different channel isoforms confer distinct properties to the cell. Scope of review Briefly, established TPC/TRPML functions and interaction partners (‘interactomes’) are discussed. Novel TRPML3 interactors are shown, and a meta-analysis of experimentally obtained channel interactomes conducted. Accordingly, interactomes are compared and contrasted, and subsequently described in detail for TPC1, TPC2, TRPML1, and TRPML3. Major conclusions TPC interactomes are well-defined, encompassing intracellular membrane organisation proteins. TRPML interactomes are varied, encompassing cardiac contractility- and chaperone-mediated autophagy proteins, alongside regulators of intercellular signalling. General significance Comprising recently proposed targets to treat cancers, infections, metabolic disease and neurodegeneration, the advancement of TPC/TRPML understanding is of considerable importance. This review proposes novel directions elucidating TPC/TRPML relevance in health and disease.
