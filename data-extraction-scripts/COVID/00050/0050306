Schematically, effector T cells specific for self-antigens exist normally, but their activity is modulated and prevented by networks of regulatory T cells. As a result of mimicry between molecular components of microorganisms and self-antigens, autoimmune disease can be triggered by specific foreign pathogens which alter the state of activity of the network from suppression to activation. Conversely, by a procedure known as T-cell vaccination, autologous effector T cells re-injected after in vitro stimulation and attenuation may alter the state of the network from an activation to a suppression. Numerous observations are reviewed that support the concept of autoimmune activity in the destruction of non-infected T4 cells. Such activity is presumed to be triggered by an antigen of viral origin, the most likely, but not the only one, being the envelope protein gp120. Based on this hypothesis, a T-cell vaccination procedure against effector T cells responsible for autoimmunopathic activity in HIV-seropositive patients is proposed, similar to the one known from experimental study of autoimmunity and presently being tested in human autoimmune diseases. Its purpose would be to prevent T-cell loss and the onset of immunodeficiency disease in HIV-seropositive patients. Apart from its potential therapeutic value, this procedure will have use as a therapeutic test from which insight will be gained about the immunopathogenesis of AIDS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
