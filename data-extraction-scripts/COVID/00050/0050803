<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Vasculitis in children</TITLE><BODY>Primary systemic vasculitides of the young are relatively rare diseases, but can have a significant morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the paediatric vasculitides. Vasculitides that predominantly affect children will be considered in more detail than vasculitic diseases that although are seen in children affect adults more commonly, such as the ANCA associated vasculitides. New classification criteria for childhood vasculitis have recently been proposed and are currently undergoing validation. Epidemiological clues continue to implicate infectious triggers in Kawasaki Disease and Henoch Schönlein purpura. Several genetic polymorphisms have now been described in the vasculitides that may be relevant in terms of disease predisposition or development of disease complications. Treatment regimens continue to improve, with the use of different immunosuppressive medications and newer therapeutic approaches such as biologic agents. However new challenges are looming in regards to the role of inflammation in endothelial health and the long term cardiovascular morbidity for children with primary systemic vasculitis. International multicenter collaboration is of utmost importance in order for us to further advance our understanding and improve the treatment and outcome of systemic vasculitis in the young.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
