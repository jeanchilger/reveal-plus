Mutants were preselected on the basis of their inability to induce syncytia in infected cells at the restrictive temperature (40°) vs the permissive temperature (31°). Of these mutants, only those with a relative plating efficiency 40° 31° of 3 × 10−3 or smaller were kept. Virus yields at 40° compared to 37° and 31° (leakiness) were determined. Most mutants (16) were RNA−, i.e., unable to synthesize virus-specific RNA at the restrictive temperature. The other four were RNA+. No qualitative differences were detected in the virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with RNA+ ts-mutants, both at 31° and 40°. Virus-specific proteins present in cells infected with is-171 (RNA−) and the RNA+-mutants (ts-43, is-201, is-209, and is-279) were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates. No qualitative differences in the pattern of virus-specific cellular proteins were detected among the mutants except for an additional polypeptide of about 46,000 daltons in ts-209-infected cells. Finally, the neuropathogenic properties of eight of the mutants were investigated. Whereas 102 PFU of wild-type virus injected intracerebrally killed 50 to 100% of 4-week-old Balc/c mice within 1 week, the mutants were highly attenuated. A dose of 105 PFU lead to no or transient disease. However, 4 weeks after infection with ts 342, is-43, or is-201 obvious histological changes were observed in brain and spinal cord of clinically healthy mice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
