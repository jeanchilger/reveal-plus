Many technological concepts exist for the generation and identification of therapeutically relevant mAbs, including the isolation and cloning of immunoglobulin (Ig) encoding genes from single B-lineage cells. This review summarizes various single B cell approaches and describes their use for the discovery of mAbs with potential therapeutic values or in basic research.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
