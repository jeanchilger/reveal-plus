Although vaccines have generally proven to be safe, safety issues have arisen that have resulted in some members of the public having a poor perception of vaccines. However, the technological advances made in recent years make the development of even safer vaccines a possibility. The new generation of vaccines will be based on pure recombinant proteins, conjugates and killed viruses. In addition, studies can be conducted in large numbers of individuals to allay unjustified fears of vaccine safety. These data will increase public confidence and ensure that vaccines become better appreciated as valuable products. Widespread confidence will be inspired by the effective communication of the realities of the benefit-to-risk ratios for each vaccine.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
