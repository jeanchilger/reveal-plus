The CNT aggregation was observed in pCNT–pCNT and pCNT–cwCNT due to van der Waals interactions between tube–tube aromatic rings, and inter-CNT bridging by chitosan, respectively. At higher chitosan concentrations, such that most to all of CNTs were wrapped with chitosan, charge–charge repulsion was found to separate robustly the cwCNTs and lead to a well dispersed solution.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
