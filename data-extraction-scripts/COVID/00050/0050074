<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Parasitic Diseases</TITLE><BODY>Captive marmosets, whether in zoos or biomedical research facilities, may become infected or infested with a variety of internal or external parasites. Modern animal housing and husbandry practices have greatly reduced the prevalence of parasitism, particularly for those parasites requiring an intermediate host. In this chapter, the author discusses selected parasitic diseases of captive marmosets. This chapter is organized phylogenetically. No attempt is made to cover all of the internal and external parasites historically reported, no matter how infrequently. Similarly, no attempt is made to cover parasites infecting or infesting other New World primates and thus potentially found in or on marmosets. The author has included those parasitisms most likely to be observed in modern animal facilities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
