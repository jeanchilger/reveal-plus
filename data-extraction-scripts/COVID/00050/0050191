Chief among the biophysical tools used to probe these energies are sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and thiol disulfide interchange experiments. Direct and indirect comparisons of thermodynamic results suggest that differences in helix–helix stabilities between micelles and bilayers may not be as large as previously anticipated. Genetic approaches continue to become more quantitative, and the propensities for helices to interact in bacterial membranes generally correlate well with in vitro measurements.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
