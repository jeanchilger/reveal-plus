Each eae + and eae/stx + strain was examined for antimicrobial susceptibility, enterohemolysin activity, and the somatic O antigen was determined. An immunoassay was used to detect Shiga toxin antigens for the eae/stx + E. coli. Significantly more (p =0.005) of the healthy calves carried eae + and eae/stx + E. coli in their feces when compared to strains from diarrheic calves. Moreover, Shiga toxin antigens were detected significantly more (p =0.001) often among the eae/stx + strains from healthy calves when compared to eae/stx + strains from diarrheic calves. However, significantly more (p =0.001) of the eae + and eae/stx + strains from diarrheic calves were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobials tested, and the strains from diarrheic calves had a significantly (p =0.05) higher rate of antimicrobial resistance to at least two different antimicrobial classes. No significant difference (p ≥0.05) was detected among the eae + and eae/stx + strains from healthy and diarrheic calves for enterohemolysin production. Serogroups O-negative, O5, O26, and O111 were predominate among both healthy and diarrheic calves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
