Optical biosensors like surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have emerged in recent times as a most reliable diagnostic device owing to their portability, reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity. SPR analyzes the kinetics of biomolecular interactions in a label-free manner. It has surpassed the conventional virus detection methods in its utility, particularly in medical diagnostics and healthcare. However, the requirement of high-end infrastructure setup and trained manpower are some of the roadblocks in realizing the true potential of SPR. This platform needs further improvisation in terms of simplicity, affordability and portability before it could be utilized in need-based remote areas of under-developed and developing countries with limited infrastructure.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
