<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-05-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Immunity and the Endocrine System</TITLE><BODY>The immune system is highly receptive to endocrine signals due to the expression of hormone receptors on immune cells. The impact of this immune–endocrine cross talk and related immune responses becomes clearly evident when assessing immunity from a sex-specific perspective.
