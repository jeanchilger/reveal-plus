<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-05-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Microbiology</TITLE><BODY>The management and containment of many treatable and preventable infectious diseases in resource-poor countries is limited by the failure to make an accurate diagnosis. Most of the world's population lacks access to accurate, affordable, easy-to-use, quality-assured, reliable, and accessible diagnostic tests and misdiagnosis of infectious diseases is common and compromises patient care. Laboratory diagnostics are also needed for the detection and surveillance of the increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance. Accurate clinical diagnosis in resource-poor settings relies strongly on the laboratory service, and the need to support the development of a quality-assured laboratory service in such settings is increasingly recognized. International organizations are actively working with local and national providers to improve laboratory services. The development of laboratory services will contribute to improved health for the local population, protection against emerging pathogens, and ensure better use of scarce health care resources.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
