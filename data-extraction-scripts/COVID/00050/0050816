A total of 59.2 mg clemastanin B and 66.1 mg indigoticoside A with purities of 94.6% and 99.0% determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were obtained in one-step elution from 250 mg crude extract, which contained clemastanin B 24.8% and indigoticoside A 28.4%, and the recoveries of clemastanin B and indigoticoside A were 90.3% and 92.2%, respectively. The chemical structure was identified by IR, MS, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
