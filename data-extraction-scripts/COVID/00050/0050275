We report here the first case of an MRV detected in the masked palm civet, which showed the highest similarity to the serotype 3 MRV. Reovirus particles were identified by electron microscopic examination of both negative-stain and thin-section. Genomic pattern analysis on SDS-PAGE showed that MPC/04 had 10-segmented double-strand RNA genome. Intranasal infection of four-week-old female BALB/c mice resulted in fatal respiratory distress but not other routes. Infections caused tissue damage and inflammation. MPC/04 grew to higher titers in the lungs than in other tissues. This research strongly suggests a need for additional experimentation to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of mammalian orthoreoviruses in infected animals and humans.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
