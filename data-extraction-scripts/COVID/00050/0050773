R. Br. (Apocynaceae), a wide used ethic-medicine in many Asia and Africa counties, has also been recorded as the common traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of illnesses in respiratory system by Dai people. Aim of the study To provide experimental data of clinical adaption of total indole alkaloids (TA) from leaf of A. scholaris for treating post-infectious cough in phase II clinical trial. Materials and methods To model post-infectious cough, all animals except control group were instilled intra-tracheal with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (80 μg/50 µL/mouse), followed by subsequent exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) for 30 min per day for a total of 30 days. Mice were orally given TA at dose of 10, 25, 50 mg/kg, and four main alkaloids (Sch: scholaricine, Epi: 19-epischolaricine, Val: vallesamine, Pic: picrinine) once daily. Cellular infiltration was assessed in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the serum was determined, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum and homogenate were examined. Finally, histopathological examination in the lungs was assessed by H. E. staining. Results After administration of TA and four major alkaloids respectively, the symptoms of cough in mice were obviously attenuated. Total white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils (NEU) amounts in BALF were reduced obviously and the pathological damage of lung was also attenuated. There was also significant reduction in IL-6, CRP, MDA and a marked improvement in SOD. Conclusions The efficacy of indole alkaloids against post-infectious cough (PIC) was shown in the down-regulation of inflammatory cells, cytokines, and the balance of antioxidants. What's more, the pharmacological effects of TA were better than single indole alkaloid, which might be related to the synergic effect of four major alkaloids.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
