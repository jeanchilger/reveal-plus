Liver histopathology of these animals revealed typical necrotic foci containing MHV 3-specific antigens. FV 3-pretreated mice, after MHV 3 infection, showed higher levels of serum transaminase (GPT) than controls, and MHV 3 replicated more rapidly and to higher titres. Our results bear out the important role of the liver sinusoidal lining in protecting against hepatocyte infection and its direct involvement in the resistance of A/J mice to MHV 3 infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
