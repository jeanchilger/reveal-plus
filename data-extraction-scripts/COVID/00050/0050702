At least four kinds of swine enteric CoVs have been identified, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and the emerging HKU2-like porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV). The small intestines, particularly the jejunum and ileum, are the most common targets of these four CoVs in vivo, and co-infections by these CoVs are frequently observed in clinically infected pigs. This study was conducted to investigate the susceptibility of the porcine ileum epithelial cell line, IPI-2I, to different swine enteric CoVs. We found that IPI-2I cells are highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV, and PEAV, as demonstrated by cytopathic effect and virus multiplication. However, only a small number of cells could be infected by PEDV, possibly due to the heterogeneity of IPI-2I cells. A homogeneous cell line, designated IPI-FX, obtained from IPI-2I cells by sub-cloning with limited serial dilutions, was found to be highly susceptible to PEDV. Furthermore, IPI-FX cells were also highly susceptible to TGEV, PDCoV, as well as PEAV. Thus, this sub-cloned IPI-FX cell line is an ideal cell model to study the mechanisms of infection, particularly co-infections of swine enteric CoVs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
