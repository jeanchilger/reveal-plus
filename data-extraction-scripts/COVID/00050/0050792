<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Chapter One The Role of Self-Assembling Lipid Molecules in Vaccination</TITLE><BODY>Abstract The advent of vaccines represents one of the most significant advances in medical history. The protection provided by vaccines has greatly contributed in reducing the number of cases of infections and most notably to the eradication of small pox. A large number of new technologies and approaches in vaccine development are currently being investigated with the goal of providing the basis for the next generation of prophylactics against an ever-expanding list of emerging and reemerging pathogens. In this chapter, we will focus on the role of lipids and lipid self-assembling vesicles in new and promising vaccination approaches. We will start by describing how lipids can induce activation of the innate immune system and focus on some lipid-derived vaccine adjuvants. Next, we will review current lipid-based self-assembling particles used as vaccine platforms, specifically liposomes and virus-like particles, and how virus-like particles have facilitated research of highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
