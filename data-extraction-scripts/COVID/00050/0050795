The high resolution offered by whole genome sequencing has the potential to revolutionise our understanding and management of S. aureus infection. Aim To outline the practicalities of whole genome sequencing and discuss how it might shape future infection control practice. Methods We review conventional typing methods and compare these with the potential offered by whole genome sequencing. Findings In contrast with conventional methods, whole genome sequencing discriminates down to single nucleotide differences and allows accurate characterisation of transmission events and outbreaks and additionally provides information about the genetic basis of phenotypic characteristics, including antibiotic susceptibility and virulence. However, translating its potential into routine practice will depend on affordability, acceptable turnaround times and on creating a reliable standardised bioinformatic infrastructure. Conclusion Whole genome sequencing has the potential to provide a universal test that facilitates outbreak investigation, enables the detection of emerging strains and predicts their clinical importance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
