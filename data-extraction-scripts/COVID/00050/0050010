Methods Open trial in which the intervention group (64 children) received OPV at the age of 2, 3, 6 and 12months. The control group (250 children) received IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) at the age of 6 and 12months. Clinical symptoms were recorded by a questionnaire at the age of 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24months. Results Otitis media episodes were less frequent in the OPV than in the control group. A significant difference was seen at the age of 6–18months (IRR=0.76 [95% CI 0.59–0.94], P =0.011) and was particularly clear among children, who attended daycare (IRR 0.37 [95% CI 0.19–0.71], P =0.003). Conclusions OPV provides some protection against otitis media. This effect may be mediated by viral interference with non-polio viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
