Defects in conformation or alterations in expression of the proteins have been reported in various diseases. Purpose The aim of this study is to review the molecular insight into the therapeutic potential of phytoconstituents targeting protein conformations or expressions. Methods Published literatures were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science; Article published till Dec 2017 were extracted. The literature was assessed from the Central University of Rajasthan, India. Present study evaluate article based on the role of active plant constituents on the conformation and expression of the different proteins. Results Plant components play their role either at the molecular level or cellular level and exhibit antibacterial, antiviral, anti-neurodegenerative and other activities. Plant active compounds isolated from different plants may either stabilize or destabilize the conformation of proteins or alter expression level of the protein involved in these diseases, therefore, can play a significant role in preventing diseases caused by the alteration in these proteins. Conclusion In the present article, we have reviewed the molecular mechanism of plant active compounds, their target proteins, methods of extraction and identification, and their biological significances. Therefore, a proper understanding of the effect of these herbal molecules on the concerned proteins may help to develop new herbal-based therapeutics for various diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
