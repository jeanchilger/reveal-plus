In this study, by an immunoblot analysis, we investigated the IgE-reactive components of FCS using sera from 16 dogs that exhibited allergic reactions after vaccination. The immunoblot analysis revealed that several FCS proteins of approximately 25-, 50-, 66-, 75-, 120-, and 175-kDa strongly reacted with IgE in the sera from dogs that showed post-vaccination allergic reactions. The 66-kDa band was detected in the sera from 14 of the 16 dog serum samples analyzed in the immunoblot analysis for FCS, and it was speculated to be albumin based on its molecular weight; however, serum IgE reactivity to bovine serum albumin could be detected in only four of the 14 dog samples. These findings demonstrated that a variety of FCS components including albumin could function as allergens in dogs that developed allergic reactions after vaccination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
