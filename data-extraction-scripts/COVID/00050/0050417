This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc γ receptor (FcγR). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcγR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcγR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody neutralized MHV-JHM and inhibited syncytium formation induced by the MHV S protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
