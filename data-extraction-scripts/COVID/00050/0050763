Although rapid and simple diagnostic methods for hMPV are needed in clinical laboratories, routine diagnostic tests are not readily available. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a commercial anti-hMPV monoclonal antibody for a direct antigen test and a shell vial culture of hMPV. In the pilot study, 15 nasopharyngeal aspirates from 15 children with acute respiratory tract infections positive for hMPV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were tested. Both direct antigen test and shell vial culture detected hMPV in 14 of 15 (93.3%) nasopharyngeal aspirates at initial diagnosis. In the larger group prospective study, nasopharyngeal aspirates from 92 children with acute respiratory tract infections were tested for hMPV with RT-PCR, direct antigen test, and shell vial culture. Both direct antigen test and shell vial culture showed positivity for 4 out of 5 specimens positive by RT-PCR. These findings indicate that direct antigen test and shell vial culture would be reliable and timely methods for the diagnosis of hMPV infection in clinical laboratories.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
