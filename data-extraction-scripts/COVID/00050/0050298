This activity was characterized as to its requirements for mono- and divalent cations, requirements for an exogenous energy source, and pH optimum. This system faithfully reflects MHV-specific RNA synthesis in the intact cell, with regard to both its time of appearance during the course of infection and the products synthesized. The system is efficient and the RNA products were identical to those observed in intact MHV-infected cells as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridization. Permeabilized cells appear to be an ideal system for studying coronavirus RNA synthesis since they closely mimic in vivo conditions while allowing much of the experimental flexibility of truly cell-free systems.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
