The purpose of this study was to determine if porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection increases genetic variability of PRRSV during serial passages in pigs and to determine if there is a difference in the PRRSV mutation rate between pigs concurrently infected with PCV2a or PCV2b. After 8 consecutive passages of PRRSV alone (group 1), PRRSV with PCV2a (group 2), or PCV2b (group 3) in pigs, the sequences of PRRSV structural genes for open reading frame (ORF) 5, ORF6, ORF7 and the partial non-structural protein gene (Nsp) 2 were determined. The total number of identified amino acid mutations in ORF5, ORF6, ORF7 and Nsp2 sequences was 30 for PRRSV infection only, 63 for PRRSV/PCV2a concurrent infection, and 77 for PRRSV/PCV2b concurrent infection when compared with the original VR2385 virus used to infect the passage 1 pigs. Compared to what occurred in pigs infected with PRRSV only, the mutation rates in ORF5 and ORF6 were significantly higher for concurrent PRRSV/PCV2b infected pigs. The PRRSV/PCV2a pigs had a significantly higher mutation rate in ORF7. The results from this study indicated that, besides ORF5 and Nsp2, the PRRSV structural genes ORF6 and ORF7 were shown to mutate at various degrees when the PRRSV was passaged over time in vivo. Furthermore, a significantly higher mutation rate of PRRSV was observed when pigs were co-infected with PCV2 highlighting the importance of concurrent infections on PRRSV evolution and control.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
