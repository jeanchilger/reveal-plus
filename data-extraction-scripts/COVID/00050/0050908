The optimal pH and temperature of the 3C-like protease for the proteolytic activity were 8.6 and 37°C, respectively. Increased concentration (∼100mM) of monovalent cations such as Na+ and K+ was inhibitory to the activity. Hg2+ and Zn2+ remarkably inhibited the protease activity, while Mg2+ and Ca2+ had no virtual effect. Several sulfhydryl reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, methyl methanethiosulfonate, N-ethylmaleimide and N-phenylmaleimide also blocked the activity, confirming the previous result that cysteine residue(s) were responsible for the proteolysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
