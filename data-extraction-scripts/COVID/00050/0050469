<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-06-22</DATELINE><TITLE>The Medicinal Chemistry of Antihepatitis Agents I: Anti-HAV, Anti-HDV, and Anti-HEV Agents</TITLE><BODY>Since viral hepatitis, as discussed in preceding chapters, has emerged as a major public health problem throughout the world affecting several hundreds of millions of people, and since no effective chemotherapy has been developed so far that can completely treat viral hepatitis, attempts are continued to find potential drugs against this disease. In this respect, the development of medicinal chemistry has been rewarding, as it covers all aspects of drug design such as recognition of important drug targets, computational chemistry, optimization of drug activity based on their structure-activity relationship, finding the three-dimensional structures of compounds by X-ray crystallography, NMR, molecular dynamics, and then synthesis of the drugs and evaluating their activity. The present chapter, thus, presents such medicinal chemistry study on anti-HAV, anti-HDV, and anti-HEV drugs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
