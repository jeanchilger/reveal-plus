However, there is no agreement on the proper indicators of its components. Use of different price indicators may be the reason for researchers’ apparently inconsistent results. The purpose of this study was to identify proper price indicators for the demand model of Japanese inbound tourism from South Korea. After comparing six models, each with different price indicators, the model with relative price and exchange rate but without transport cost was identified as the best model in which relative price, exchange rate, and per capita income were found to be significant.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
