Objectives To compare case fatality rate (CFR) and viral aetiologies of ARTI between HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations in Africa. Study design We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Africa Journal Online, and Global Index Medicus to identify studies published from January 2000 to April 2018. Random-effect meta-analysis method was used to assess association (pooled weighted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI)). Results A total of 36 studies (126,526 participants) were included. CFR was significantly higher in patients with HIV than in HIV-negative controls (OR 4.10, 95%CI: 2.63–6.27, I²: 93.7%). The risk was significantly higher among children ≤5 years (OR 5.51, 95%CI 2.83–10.74) compared to people aged >5 years (OR 1.48, 95%CI 1.17–1.89); p = 0.0002. There was no difference between children (15 years) and adults and between regions of Africa. There was no difference for viral respiratory aetiologies (Enterovirus, Adenovirus, Bocavirus, Coronavirus, Metapneumovirus, Parainfluenza, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus) of ARTI between HIV-positive and HIV-negative people, except for Rhinovirus where being HIV-negative was associated with Rhinovirus (OR 0.70; 95%CI 0.51–0.97, I²: 63.4%). Conclusions This study shows an increased risk of deaths among HIV-infected individuals with ARTI, however with no difference in viral aetiologies compared to HIV-negative individuals in Africa. ARTI deserves more attention from HIV health-care providers for efficient control. Specific strategies are needed for HIV-positive children under 5.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
