Cytoplasmic fluorescence was first observed at 12 hr postinfection (h.p.i) in infected HRT-18 cultures. This fluorescence coincided with the appearance of cell surface antigen reacting with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies to BCV antigens. At 24 h.p.i the amount of viral antigens at the surface of HRT-18 had increased, although cytoplasmic fluorescence remained constant. Infected BFS cells but not HRT-18 cells formed polykaryons when incubated in the presence of trypsin. One viral antigen in the plasma membrane of BFS cells was thus identified as the S glycoprotein with a fusion domain. In contrast to HRT-18 cells, the overall amount of BCV antigens at the surface of BFS cells remained constant after the onset of fusion. Analysis of the labeling characteristics established that the goldmarked-sites represented de novo expression of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane of infected cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
