We have shown that infection with RbCV results in the development of myocarditis and congestive heart failure and that some survivors of RbCV infection go on to develop dilated cardiomyopathy in the chronic phase. Serial ECGs were recorded on 31 RbCV-infected rabbits. Measurements of heart rate; P-R interval; QRS duration; QTc interval; and P-, QRS-, and T-wave voltages were taken. The recordings were also examined for disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. The acute and subacute phases were characterized by sinus tachycardia with depressed R- and T-wave voltages as well as disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. In most animals in the chronic phase, the sinus rate returned to near-baseline values with resolution of the QRS voltage changes. The ECG changes observed during RbCV infection are similar to the spectrum of interval/segment abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, conduction defects, and myocardial pathology seen in human myocarditis, heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Because animals often died suddenly in the absence of severe clinical signs of congestive heart failure during the acute phase, RbCV infection may increase ventricular vulnerability, resulting in sudden cardiac death. RbCV infection may provide a rare opportunity to study sudden cardiac death in an animal model in which the ventricle is capable of supporting ventricular fibrillation, and invasive techniques monitoring cardiac function can be performed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
