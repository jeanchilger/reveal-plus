<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Cutaneous Vasculitis in Small Animals</TITLE><BODY>Cutaneous vasculitis is an inflammatory process targeting blood vessels. Underlying factors include drugs, infectious diseases, adverse reactions to food, malignancies, and immune-mediated diseases. Vasculitis is a reaction pattern warranting a workup to identify triggers. Presenting symptoms include purpura, pitting edema, and skin ulcerations. Constitutional signs include fever, depression, and anorexia and seem to be present in the majority of patients. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, treatment and follow-up must be tailored to the individual. High-dose immunosuppressive medications are only recommended once infectious diseases capable of producing a similar constellation of clinical signs have been ruled out.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
