Total negative pressure isolation using portable bioisolation tents may provide a solution. The study assesses the ability of health care workers to perform emergency procedures in this environment. METHODS: Physician performance in completing predetermined critical actions in 5 emergency care scenarios inside and outside of a bioisolation tent (“setting”) was studied in an advanced medical simulation laboratory. By design, no pretraining of subjects about total negative pressure isolation use occurred. Impact of setting on time to completion of predetermined critical actions was the primary outcome measured. Secondary variables studied included impact of study groups, scenarios, and run order (inside or outside of the tent first). Subjective assessments were obtained through questionnaires. RESULTS: Four teams of 3 physicians completed 5 emergency patient care scenarios during 2 4-hour sessions. Mean time to completion of critical actions was for tent/no tent 298 seconds/284 seconds (P=.69, one way ANOVA), respectively. Mean time to completion for first versus second performance of a scenario in the crossover design was 338 versus 243 (P=.01). The mean score for self-assessed performance did not differ according to setting. CONCLUSION: The ability of physicians naive to the total negative pressure isolation environment to perform emergency medical critical actions was not significantly degraded by a simulated bioisolation tent patient care environment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
