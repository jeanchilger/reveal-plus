Previous studies have implicated cytokine and chemokine genes in susceptibility to Chagas disease. Here we investigated the association between the interferon-gamma gene (IFNG) +874T/A polymorphism and Chagas disease, focusing on susceptibility and severity. This study included 236 chagasic patients (asymptomatic, n =116; cardiomyopathic, n =120) and 282 healthy controls from a Colombian population where T. cruzi is highly endemic. Individuals were genotyped for functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2430561; A/T) of the IFNG gene by amplification refractory mutational system PCR (ARMS-PCR). Moreover, clinical manifestations of Chagas in patients were analyzed. We found a significant difference in the distribution of the IFNG +874 “A” allele between patients and healthy controls (P =0.003; OR=1.46, 95% CI, 1.13–1.89). The frequency of the IFNG +874 genotype A/A, which is associated with reduced production of interferon-gamma, was increased in the patients relative to controls (38.1% vs. 26.6%). We compared the frequencies of IFNG alleles and genotypes between asymptomatic patients and those with chagasic cardiomyopathy and found no significant difference. Our data suggest that the IFNG +874T/A genetic polymorphism may be involved in susceptibility but not in the progression of Chagas disease in this Colombian population.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
