Of the 96 clones isolated from the SSH library, 28 unique expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained, of which eight were confirmed to be slightly but significantly (P < 0.05) more up-regulated by the re-infection at 6 h post infection (hpi). Expression kinetics studies at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi revealed that the eight ESTs were significantly (P = 0.016) more up-regulated by the first infection, with a major peak at 3 hpi. A total of 96 genes reported in literature to be up-regulated by bacterial infections were selected and subjected to expression analysis at 3 hpi. Of the 96 selected genes, 19 were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) induced by A. hydrophila after the first infection and the re-infection. The 19 genes belonged to the following five main categories: 1) toll-like receptor (TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR21); 2) antimicrobial peptide (NK-lysin type 1, NK-lysin type 2, NK-lysin type 3, cathepsin D, transferrin, hepcidin); 3) cytokine or chemokine (interleukin-1β, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor α, chemokine CXCL-10); 4) signaling proteins (cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, very large inducible GTPase 1, arginine deiminase type 2, lymphokine-activated killer T-cell originated protein kinase); 5) lysozyme (lysozyme c). Overall, the total 27 genes (8 ESTs plus the 19 selected genes) were significantly (P < 0.001) more induced by the first infection. Peaked expression of lysozyme c and serum lysozyme activity after the first infection were seen at 24 hpi, whereas that after the re-infection were seen at 12 hpi, suggesting that both innate and adaptive immunity were involved in the defense against the re-infection of A. hydrophila.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
