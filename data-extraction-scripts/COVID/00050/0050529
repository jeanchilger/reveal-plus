The knowledge gained has been used to develop new vaccines with specific, reactive antigens which elicit protective immune mediated responses (humoral and/or cell mediated) in the host. These vaccines should not burden the immune system by initiating responses against non-essential antigens. However, the efficacy of these vaccines is only as good as the delivery technology or route used to present them to the immune system. Some vaccines, traditionally given by the parenteral route, are now given by the natural route; either orally or intranasally. Two major advantages, often interrelated, are the rapid onset of immunity and stimulation of the local, mucosal immunity. These new technologies are now making an impact on current vaccine development. The balance has to be found between what is technologically feasible and what will provide at least as good a protective immunity as current, conventional vaccines. As new and emerging diseases appear globally, new opportunities arise for molecular and conventional technologies to be applied to both the development and delivery of novel vaccines, as well as the improvement of vaccines in current use.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
