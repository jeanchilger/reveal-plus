The study was performed on 100 sera collected from cats belonging to catteries or community shelters and to households. The serum samples were initially tested with the virus neutralisation (VN) test and the results were then compared with the ELISA. The VN yielded 79 negative and 21 positive sera but the ELISA confirmed only 74 as negative. The ELISA-negative sera were also found to be free of feline coronoviruses-specific antibodies by Western blotting. Using the VN as the gold standard test, ELISA had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93.6%, with an overall agreement of 95%. The Kappa (κ) test indicated high association between the two tests (κ = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.743–0.980). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.8, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.93. The prevalence of FCoV II antibodies in the sampled population based on the gold standard was 62% (95% CI 0.44–0.77) among multi-cat environments, and 4% (95% CI 0.01–0.11) among single cat households.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
