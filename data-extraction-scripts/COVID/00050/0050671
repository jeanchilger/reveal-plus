Primers and probes were designed to detect specific sequences on the most conserved regions of the S segment. The limit of detection of the assay was 10 copies per reaction which is an improvement of 3log10 FFU/mL over the sensitivity of conventional RT-PCR. The specificity of the primers and probe was confirmed with the closely related Nairoviruses CCHFV and Hazara virus, and on the non-related viruses Coronavirus and Influenza A virus. This qRT-PCR assay was used to screen nucleic acids extracted from 498 ticks collected in the Republic of Chad. One sample was found positive suggesting that DUGV is present in this part of the world. The molecular assay developed in this study is sensitive, specific and rapid and can be used for research and epidemiological studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
