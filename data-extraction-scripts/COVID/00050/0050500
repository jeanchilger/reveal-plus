In this study, we present evidence that virion disassembly is a key determinant of reovirus oncolysis. To penetrate cell membranes and initiate infection, the outermost capsid proteins of reovirus must be proteolyzed to generate a disassembled particle called an infectious subviral particle (ISVP). In fibroblasts, this process is mediated by the endo/lysosomal proteases cathepsins B and L. We have analyzed the early events of infection in reovirus-susceptible and -resistant cells. We find that, in contrast to susceptible glioma cells and Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, reovirus-resistant cancer cells and untransformed NIH3T3 cells restrict virion uncoating and subsequent gene expression. Disassembly-restrictive cells support reovirus infection, as in vitro-generated ISVPs establish productive infection, and pretreatment with poly(I:C) does not prevent infection in cancer cells. We find that the level of active cathepsin B and L is increased in tumors and that disassembly-restrictive glioma cells support reovirus oncolysis when grown as a tumor in vivo. Together, these results provide a model in which proteolytic disassembly of reovirus is a critical determinant of susceptibility to reovirus oncolysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
