Valuable lessons were learned, especially the important role that the laboratory and transfusion service plays in the treatment for patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) by providing data for supportive care and fluid resuscitation as well as the generation of investigational therapies such as convalescent plasma (CP). To provide treatment support, laboratories had to evaluate and update procedures to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel. Because there is no licensed EVD-specific treatment, CP was used in more than 99 patients with only 1 possible severe adverse event reported. However, given the biologic variability inherent in CP as well as the small number of patient treated in a nonrandomized fashion, the efficacy of CP in the treatment of EVD remains unknown.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
