Previous studies focused on the IFN system of megabats (suborder Yinpterochiroptera). We present statistically robust RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on transcriptomes of cells from the “microbat” Myotis daubentonii (suborder Yangochiroptera) responding at 6 and 24 h to either an IFN-inducing virus or treatment with IFN. Our data reveal genes triggered only by virus, either in both humans and Myotis (CCL4, IFNL3, CH25H), or exclusively in Myotis (STEAP4). Myotis cells also express a series of conserved IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and an unusually high paralog number of the antiviral ISG BST2 (tetherin) but lack several ISGs that were described for megabats (EMC2, FILIP1, IL17RC, OTOGL, SLC24A1). Also, in contrast to megabats, we detected neither different IFN-alpha subtypes nor an unusually high baseline expression of IFNs. Thus, Yangochiroptera microbats, represented by Myotis, may possess an IFN system with distinctive features.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
