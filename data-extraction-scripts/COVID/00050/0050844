The viral subunit was released from the virion by sonication and was separated from intact virus and other viral components by isopycnic centrifugation. It had a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.02 g/ml. Further purification consisted of gel filtration through Sephadex G200, in which process the immunogen, with a molecular weight of approximately 25 000, was the last component to be eluted. A group of ten young, weaned swine, inoculated intramuscularly with two or three 1-mg doses of the viral subunit were protected against challenge with virulent TGE virus, probably by the induction of secretory IgA. The immunogen also induced a humoral immune response of variable magnitude (titers ranging from 8 to 5 625) in the animals. These antibodies are not believed to be directly related to protection against infection. They can, however, be easily identified by serologic procedures and may serve as a convenient indicator of responsiveness to the TGE viral immunogen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
