STUDY DESIGN: This study included 1462 women who had been hospitalized with pneumonia during pregnancy and used 7310 matched women without pneumonia as a comparison group. RESULTS: Compared to women without pneumonia, conditional logistic regression analyses showed that the adjusted odds ratios for LBW, preterm birth, SGA, CS, Apgar scores <7 at 5 minutes, and preeclampsia/eclampsia in women with pneumonia were 1.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41–2.12), 1.71 (95% CI, 1.42–2.05), 1.35 (95% CI, 1.17–1.56), 1.77 (95% CI, 1.58–1.98), 3.86 (95% CI, 1.64–9.06), and 3.05 (95% CI, 2.01–4.63), respectively. CONCLUSION: Women with pneumonia during pregnancy had significantly higher risk of LBW, preterm birth, SGA, low Apgar scores infants, CS, and preeclampsia/eclampsia, compared to unaffected women.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
