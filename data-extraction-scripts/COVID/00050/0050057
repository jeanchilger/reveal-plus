<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-10-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Suidae and Tayassuidae</TITLE><BODY>The Suidae and Tayassuidae live on all continents except Antarctica. True wild boars were indigenous to Europe and Asia and are the ancestors to the domestic pig; with whom they share the same scientific name Sus scrofa. Wild boars have been introduced to the Americas and many islands. Because of the close genetic relationship, in many areas they have interbred with domestic pigs and formed considerable populations of feral suids that represent wild boar and feral pig crosses. Wild suid populations are relatively hardy and most disease research has been focused on their potential as a reservoir for diseases of concern for commercial pig production. The Togian Island babirusa, pygmy hog, Visayan warty pig, Javan warty pig, and Chacoan peccary are endangered. For all species, hunting, habitat loss, and hybridization are important threats to conservation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
