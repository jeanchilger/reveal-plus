<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Pathogen-Tested Planting Material</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Certification programs have been developed to provide plant material that meets a predetermined level of plant health. The primary objectives of these programs are to limit pathogen incidence in plant material in order to minimize losses by growers and prevent movement of harmful pests and pathogens that may harm the environment. For many fruit and nut crops, orchards are expected to remain productive for years or decades; thus, starting with plants of high health status is essential. The components of certification programs in terms of plant health will be outlined, along with the benefits of harmonizing these programs where possible to facilitate plant movement without increasing trade in plant pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
