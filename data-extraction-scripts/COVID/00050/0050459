However, the contribution between peripheral and CNS activation remains unclear. During gliatropic coronavirus induced encephalomyelitis, accumulation of protective antibody secreting cells is preceded by infiltration of B cells with a naïve and early differentiation phenotype (Phares et al., 2014). Investigation of the temporal dynamics of B cell activation in draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and the CNS revealed that peak CNS infiltration of early activated, unswitched IgD(+) and IgM(+) B cells coincided with polyclonal activation in CLN. By contrast, isotype-switched IgG(+) B cells did not accumulate until peripheral germinal center formation. In the CNS, unswitched B cells were confined to the perivascular space and meninges, with only rare B cell clusters, while isotype-switched B cells localized to parenchymal areas. Although ectopic follicle formation was not observed, more differentiated B cell subsets within the CNS expressed the germinal center marker GL7, albeit at lower levels than CLN counterparts. During chronic infection, CNS IgD(int) and IgD(−) B cell subsets further displayed sustained markers of proliferation and CD4 T cell help, which were only transiently expressed in the CLN. A contribution of local CD4 T cell help to sustain B cell activation was supported by occasional B cells adjacent to T cells. The results suggest that accumulation of differentiated B cell subsets within the CNS is largely dictated by peripheral activation, but that local events contribute to their sustained activation independent of ectopic follicle formation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
