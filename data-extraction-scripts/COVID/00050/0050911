Following viral infection, diverse cell signaling pathways are initiated by the cells, with the major goal of establishing an antiviral state. However, viruses have been shown to exploit cellular signaling pathways for their own effective replication. Genome-wide siRNA screens have also identified numerous host factors that either support (proviral) or inhibit (antiviral) virus replication. Some of the host factors might be dispensable for the host but may be critical for virus replication; therefore such cellular factors may serve as targets for development of antiviral therapeutics. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a major cell signaling pathway that is known to be activated by diverse group of viruses. MAPK interacting kinase 1 (MNK1) has been shown to regulate both cap-dependent and internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES)-mediated mRNA translation. In this review we have discuss the role of MAPK in virus replication, particularly the role of MNK1 in replication and translation of viral genome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
