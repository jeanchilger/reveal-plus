This animal was referred for examination with progressive paralysis and shown to be free from feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus, feline coronavirus and Toxoplasma gondii. It died 2 months later. At necropsy, the only lesion detected was a malacic area, 4cm in length, in the spinal cord. Histopathological examination of the spinal cord revealed severe granulomatous inflammation associated with large numbers of encapsulated yeast cells. In addition to the granulomatous host response, necrosis, digestion chambers, Gitter cells, spheroids and lymphocytic perivascular cuffs were features of the malacic areas. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii yeast cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
