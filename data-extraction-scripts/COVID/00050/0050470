Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed for this purpose. This investigation expanded on the work of Huang and Tsao [The influence of air motion on bacteria removal in negative pressure isolation rooms. HVAC & R Research 2005; 11: 563–85], who studied how ventilation conditions impact dispersion of pathogenic nuclei in an AIIR by investigating the airflow conditions impacting dispersion of infectious agents in the AIIR. The work included a careful quality assurance study of the computed airflow, and final simulations were performed on a fine tetrahedral mesh with approximately 1.3×106 cells. The 1μm diameter particles were released from a 0.001225m2 area representing the nose and mouth. Two cases were investigated during the current study: continuous exhalation of pathogen-laden air from the patient and expulsion of pathogenic particles by a single cough or sneeze. Slow decay of particle concentration in the AIIR during the single cough/sneeze simulation and tendency for particle accumulation near the AIIR walls observed in the continuous breathing simulation suggest that unintended exposures are possible despite the ventilation system. Based on these findings, it is recommended that extra care be taken to assure proper functionality of personal protective equipment used in an AIIR.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
