HMPV has a worldwide distribution with infectivity rates approaching 100%, and immunocompromised patients are particularly at risk from viral exposure. No anti-HMPV vaccine is available and diagnosis is primarily based on in-house molecular or serological tests, in part due to limited availability of recombinant HMPV antigens. Objective To generate a panel of HMPV-derived recombinant antigens, develop standardised ELISA systems for HMPV IgG detection and explore the nature of B cell memory against HMPV to underpin future vaccine studies. Study design HMPV viral RNA was isolated from a clinical specimen and RT-PCR was conducted. The HMPV M and P genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The HMPV N gene was cloned and expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Each purified recombinant antigens was subsequently employed in HMPV-specific ELISA. Results High-level expression, and purification, of both HMPV matrix (M) (10mg/g cells) and phosphoprotein (P) (3.82mg/g cells) were achieved in an E. coli expression system. Recombinant HMPV (N) was successfully expressed in, and purified from the baculovirus expression system. Overall, a 99% HMPV IgG seroprevalence was observed (n =96) using HMPV M-, N- and P-ELISA, respectively. The M antigen proved to be the most diagnostically useful with 99% of specimens tested exhibiting anti-M protein reactivity. A high correlation was observed between anti-M and N IgG reactivity (r =0.96), with significant correlation also evident for anti-N and P IgG reactivity (r =0.74). Lowest correlation was evident for anti-M and P IgG reactivity (r =0.57). Finally, the first demonstration of HMPV-specific B cell memory (ranging 1–15 spot forming cells (SFC)/million cells) was achieved against M and P antigens in 40% of individuals tested. Conclusion This work describes robust diagnostic systems for HMPV and new insight into antigen-specific B cell memory against HMPV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
