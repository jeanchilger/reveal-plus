A complete laboratory testing as well as mediastinal tissue sampling via Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS)-guided Transbronchial Needle Biopsy (TBNB) did not reveal a definite diagnosis. After experiencing acute respiratory failure which led to intensive care unit, the patient underwent a cervical lymph node biopsy which revealed peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). A CT-guided trans-thoracic lung biopsy was performed that showed involvement of the lung parenchyma in the context of PTCL-NOS. Lung involvement is a rare extra-nodal manifestation of PTCL. The imaging patterns of this lymphoma have not been well described. We conclude that the finding of crazy paving pattern is a rare manifestation of this disease. In patients with pre-existing lymphoma, lung involvement should be included in the differential due to high pre-test probability.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
