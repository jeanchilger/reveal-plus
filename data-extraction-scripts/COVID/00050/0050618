Accumulating evidences have revealed that PRRSV infection fails to induce type I interferon (IFN-α/β), which are normally induced rapidly during virus replication in virus-infected cells. However, the potential mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, we showed that PRRSV infection activated the signal transduction components of NF-κB and AP-1, but not of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), an essential IFN-β transcription factor. Furthermore, PRRSV infection significantly blocked synthetic dsRNA-induced IFN-β production and IRF3 nuclear translocation. To better understand the upstream signaling events that suppress IRF3 activation, we further investigated the roles of individual components of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)- and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated signaling pathway for IFN-β production during PRRSV infection. We observed that PRRSV infection significantly inhibited dsRNA-induced IRF3 activation and IFN-β generation by inactivating IFN-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), an adaptor molecule of RIG-I. In contrast, PRRSV infection only partially reduced the activation of TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF), an adaptor molecule of TLR3. Our results suggest that PRRSV infection suppresses production of IFN-β primarily by interfering with the IPS-1 activation in the RIG-I signaling pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
