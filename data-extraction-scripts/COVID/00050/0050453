<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-08-31</DATELINE><TITLE>The renin–angiotensin system in acute respiratory distress syndrome</TITLE><BODY>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) counterbalances with ACE and functions as a negative regulator of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). The importance of RAS in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has recently re-emerged owing to the identification of ACE2 as a receptor for the SARS-coronavirus. Recent studies have demonstrated that ACE2 protects mice from acute lung injury as well as SARS-mediated lung injury. We review the role of the RAS, in particular ACE2, in the pathogenesis of ARDS.
