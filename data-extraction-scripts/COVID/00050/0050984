<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Polymerases of Coronaviruses: Structure, Function, and Inhibitors</TITLE><BODY>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major group of viruses known to be responsible for wide spectrum of diseases in multiple species. The CoVs affecting human population are referred to as human coronaviruses (HCoVs). They lead to multiple respiratory diseases, such as common cold, pneumonia, bronchitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome. CoVs are RNA viruses that require RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) for various steps in their life cycle. Action of RdRP is needed in several steps in the life cycle of CoVs and thus RdRPs constitute potential targets for drugs and other therapeutic interventions for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. The chapter therefore presents a detailed discussion on the structure and functions of CoV polymerases and the development of their potential inhibitors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
