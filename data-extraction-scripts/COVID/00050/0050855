We applied the volatile extract of HC to an RPF rat model and analyzed the effect on ALI and RPF using hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining, routine blood tests, a cell count of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) content, van Gieson (VG) staining, hydroxyproline (Hyp) content and the dry/wet weight ratio. The expression of IFN-γ/STAT1, IL-4/STAT6 and TGF-β1/Smads was analyzed using ELISA, immunohistochemistry and western blotting methods. The active ingredients of the HC vapor extract were analyzed using a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC–MS), and the effects of the active ingredients of HC on the viability of NIH/3T3 and RAW264.7 cells were detected using an MTT assay. The active ingredients of the HC vapor extract included 4-terpineol, α-terpineol, l-bornyl acetate and methyl-n-nonyl ketone. The results of the lung H&E staining, Hyp content, dry/wet weight ratio and VG staining suggested that the HC vapor extract repaired lung injury and reduced RPF in a dose-dependent manner and up-regulated IFN-γ and inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad pathway in vivo. In vitro, it could inhibit the viability of RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells. It also dose-dependently inhibited the expression of TGF-β1 and enhanced the expression of IFN-γ in NIH/3T3. The HC vapor extract inhibited LPS-induced RPF by up-regulating IFN-γ and inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smad pathway.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
