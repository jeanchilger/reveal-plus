The purpose was to define the potential targets for anti-SARS drugs in the structural proteins from human SARS related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) while knowing little about the functional sites and possible mutations in these proteins. From a probabilistic viewpoint, we can theoretically select the amino acid pairs as potential candidates for anti-SARS drugs. These candidates have a greater chance of colliding with anti-SARS drugs, are more likely to link with the protein functions and are less vulnerable to mutations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
