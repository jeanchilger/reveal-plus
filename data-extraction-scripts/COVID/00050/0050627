In this study, we selected seven epitopes from the spike (S1), spike (S2), and nucleocapsid (N) protein and constructed a multi-epitope DNA vaccine. The 7-day-old chickens were immunized intramuscularly with multi-epitope DNA vaccine encapsulated by liposome and boosted two weeks later, and were challenged by virulent IBV strain five weeks post booster. The results showed that multi-epitope DNA vaccine led to a dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses, and provided up to 80.0% rate of immune protection. The novel immunogenic chimeric multi-epitope DNA vaccine revealed in this study provided a new candidate target for IBV vaccine development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
