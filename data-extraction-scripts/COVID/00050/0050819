Although the albino rat is a less than ideal model for ocular toxicity studies, it has gained popularity for specific applications and may be the first species in which the ocular toxicity of a systemically administered xenobiotic becomes evident. This chapter reviews the embryology, anatomy, and physiology of the eye and associated glands and describes common nonneoplastic and neoplastic lesions encountered in laboratory rats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
