The molecular basis for this local immune suppression, however, is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin), a recently identified member of the dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) family, in the regulation of hepatic T-cell immune response. Methods The regulation of T-cell effector function by LSECtin was determined by co-stimulated T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody and LSECtin protein, or co-culture of T-cell receptor transgenic T cells with mouse LSECs in vitro. We generated LSECtin knockout mice and prepared recombinant LSECtin protein and complementary DNA plasmids to analyze the role of LSECtin in hepatic T-cell immune regulation in vivo. Results We showed that LSECtin specifically recognized activated T cells and negatively regulated their immune responses. In mice with T-cell–mediated acute liver injury, the lack of LSECtin accelerated the disease owing to an increased T-cell immune response, whereas the exogenous administration of recombinant LSECtin protein or plasmid ameliorated the disease via down-regulation of T-cell immunity. Conclusions Our results reveal that LSECtin is a novel regulator of T cells and expose a crucial mechanism for hepatic T-cell immune suppression, perhaps opening up a new approach for treatment of inflammatory diseases in the liver.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
