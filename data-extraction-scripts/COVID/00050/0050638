<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-04-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Animal Models with a Genetic Alteration of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas Axis</TITLE><BODY>The aim of this chapter is to describe the animal models generated by transgenic technology for the functional analysis of the protective axis of the renin–angiotensin system, consisting of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), and Mas. Transgenic overexpression of the components of this axis in general led to an ameliorated cardiac and vascular damage in disease states and to an improved metabolic profile. Knockout models for ACE2 and Mas, however, show aggravated cardiovascular pathologies and a metabolic syndrome-like state. In particular, the local production of Ang-(1-7) in the vascular wall, in the heart, and in the brain was found to be of high physiological relevance by the use of transgenic animals overexpressing ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) in these tissues.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
