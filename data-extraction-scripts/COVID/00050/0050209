Although the infection may be responsible for some mortality, its impact is mainly associated with the impairment of intestinal functions and lower performance of animals. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cryptosporidiosis on the intestinal functions in neonatal experimentally infected Holstein calves. Absorption tests with d-xylose and retinyl-palmitate, and the lactulose/mannitol test of intestinal permeability were simultaneously performed in 1-week intervals from challenge to full recovery. In infected animals, reduced intestinal absorptive capacity for both d-xylose and retinyl-palmitate was observed on day 7 post-infection (p.i.). At the same time, a more than 100% elevation of intestinal permeability was observed in the infected calves. All intestinal functions, except absorption of retinyl-palmitate, were significantly affected and changes were detected up to day 14 p.i. In contrast, results of all tests obtained on day 21 p.i. suggest full recovery of the infected intestine. Significantly, growth of the calves which had recovered from cryptosporidiosis was still affected between days 14 and 21 p.i.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
