In these mice, expression of HPrP was detected only in brain tissue, with highest levels found in neurons of the cerebellu, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. These transgenic mice were susceptible to infection by the 263K strain of hamster scrapie with an average incubation period of 93 days, compared to 72 days in normal hamsters. In contrast, nontransgenic mice were not susceptible to this agent. These results indicate that neuron-specific expression of the 1 kb HPrP minigene including the HPrP open-reading frame is sufficient to mediate susceptibility to hamster scraple, and that HPrP expression in nonneuronal brain cells is not necessary to overcome the TSE species barrier.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
