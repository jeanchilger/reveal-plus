However, sampling viable airborne viruses is challenging as conventional bioaerosol sampling devices operate on inertia-based mechanisms that inherently have low sampling efficiency for virus aerosols in the ultrafine size range (< 100nm). Herein, a Batch Adiabatic-expansion for Size Intensification by Condensation (BASIC) approach was developed for efficient sampling of virus aerosols. The BASIC utilizes adiabatic expansion in a supersaturated container to activate condensation of water vapor onto virus aerosol particles, thus amplifying the size of the particles by orders of magnitude. Using aerosolized MS2 bacteriophage, the BASIC's performance was evaluated and optimized both from the perspectives of physical size amplification as well as preservation of the viability of the MS2 bacteriophage. Experimental results show that one compression/expansion (C/E) cycle under a compression pressure of 103.5kPa and water temperature of 25°C was sufficient to increase the particle diameter from < 100nm to > 1µm; further increases in the number of C/E cycles neither increased particle number concentration nor diameter. An increase in compression pressure was associated with physical size amplification and a higher concentration of collected viable MS2. Water temperature of 40°C was found to be the optimal for size amplification as well as viability preservation. No significant effect on particle size enlargement was observed by changing the dwell time after expansion. The results illustrate the BASIC's capability as a simple, quick and inexpensive tool for rapid sampling of viable airborne viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
