The plant traditional medical application indicates great antimicrobial properties, so E. camaldulensis essential oils and plant extracts have been widely examined. Essential oil of E. camaldulensis is active against many Gram positive (0.07–1.1%) and Gram negative bacteria (0.01–3.2%). The antibacterial effect is confirmed for bark and leaf extracts (conc. from 0.08 μg/mL to 200 mg/mL), with significant variations depending on extraction procedure. Eucalyptus camaldulensis essential oil and extracts are among the most active against bacteria when compared with those from other species of genus Eucalyptus. The most fungal model organisms are sensitive to 0.125–1.0% of E. camaldulensis essential oil. The extracts are active against C. albicans (0.2–200 mg/mL leaf extracts and 0.5 mg/mL bark extracts), and against various dermatophytes. Of particular importance is considerable the extracts’ antiviral activity against animal and human viruses (0.1–50 μg/mL). Although the antiprotozoal activity of E. camaldulensis essential oil and extracts is in the order of magnitude of concentration several hundred mg/mL, it is considerable when taking into account current therapy cost, toxicity, and protozoal growing resistance. Some studies show that essential oils’ and extracts’ antimicrobial activity can be further potentiated in combinations with antibiotics (beta-lactams, fluorochinolones, aminoglycosides, polymyxins), antivirals (acyclovir), and extracts of other plants (e.g. Annona senegalensis; Psidium guajava). The present data confirm the river red gum considerable antimicrobial properties, which should be further examined with particular attention to the mechanisms of antimicrobial activity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
