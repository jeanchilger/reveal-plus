Cesarean-delivered colostrum-deprived (CDCD) piglets were given one pre-challenge dose of Mab and an equal dose of the same Mab at each successive feeding after challenge. In vivo challenge results demonstrated that neither Mabs given individually nor combinations of the Mabs were able to protect neonatal pigs against a lethal dose of TGEV. However, in parallel experiments, polyclonal antibodies from immune colostrum or serum were protective.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
