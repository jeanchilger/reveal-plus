To achieve early and accurate diagnostics, determining the radiological characteristics of the disease is of great importance. In this small scale research we retrospectively reviewed and selected six cases confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection in West China Hospital and investigated their initial and follow-up HRCT features, along with the clinical characteristics. The 2019-nCoV pneumonia basically showed a multifocal or unifocal involvement of ground-glass opacity (GGO), sometimes with consolidation and fibrosis. No pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy was identified in our presented cases. The follow-up CT generally demonstrated mild to moderate progression of the lesion, with only one case showing remission by the reducing extent and density of the airspace opacification.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
