However, little is known about the entry route of influenza virus in differentiated epithelia, in vivo site of infection for influenza virus. Here, we show that in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney type II (MDCK II) cells, influenza virus has a specific utilization of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway and requires Eps15 for host cell entry.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
