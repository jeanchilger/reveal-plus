Individual animals were exposed to a specific dose of airborne pathogen. Following exposure, animals were individually housed and monitored for evidence of infection. The detection of specific antibodies and/or the pathogen in diagnostic specimens was evidence that the exposure dose resulted in infection. If replicated over a range of doses, the results can be used to derive a dose–response curve for a variety of animal species and infectious pathogens. This information is useful in estimating the likelihood of infection associated with exposure to airborne infectious microorganisms. Applications include predicting the risk of transmission associated with exposure to airborne pathogens, modeling the transmission of airborne pathogens, and determining requirements for effective exposure doses for vaccines delivered in aerosols.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
