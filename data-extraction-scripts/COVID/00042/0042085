Infection with more than one pathogen has been reported in RTI; however, the association of the pathogen spectrum in upper and lower respiratory tract infections remains unclear. Methods A prospective study was conducted during February to October 2016. Fifty-five nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and 30 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 55 hospitalized children aged less than 14years (mean age 40months) and diagnosed with an RTI were collected. All samples were detected for 18 respiratory pathogens using the Filmarray assay, real-time PCR, or nested PCR methods. Detection results and clinical characteristics of all cases were analyzed using chi-square and t tests. Results Forty-one of 55 (74.5%) NPS obtained from children were positive for at least one pathogen by the Filmarray assay. Of these cases, 53.7% (22/41) were co-infected. The most commonly detected pathogen was rhinovirus (RV), followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Infection by both RV and MP was the most frequently observed pattern of co-infection. Similar results were observed using real-time PCR. The pathogens in the NPS from 76.6% of cases detected by Filmarray and 80.0% of cases by real-time PCR included all the pathogens detected in the BALF sample from the same individual. The Filmarray assay showed an 80% concordance rate with real-time PCR and had a turnaround time of less than 1.2h. No significant differences were observed between the association of single-infection and co-infection with clinical characteristics, neither by Filmarray nor real-time PCR. Conclusion The spectrum of pathogens is mostly concordant in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Collecting NPS for detection can be a non-invasive and more convenient option compared with BALF. Although co-infection is common in children with an RTI, the clinical significance of co-infection remains unclear and warrants further analysis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
