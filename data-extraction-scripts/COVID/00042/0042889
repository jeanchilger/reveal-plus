<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1989-03-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Predict7, a program for protein structure prediction</TITLE><BODY>Abstract We describe a program for protein sequence analysis which runs in IBM PC computers. Protein sequences are loaded from files in Mount-Conrad and Lipman-Pearson format. Seven features are analyzed: hydrophilicity, hydropathy, surface probability, side chain flexibility, antigenicity, secondary structure and N-glycosylation sites. Numeric results can be shown, printed or stored in files exportable to other programs. Graphics of up to four predictions can be displayed on the screen, printed out or plotted, with several definable options. This program has been designed to be fast, user-friendly and to be shared with the scientific community.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
