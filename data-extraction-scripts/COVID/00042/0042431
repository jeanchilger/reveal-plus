<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-02-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Nanomechanical Sensors</TITLE><BODY>This chapter introduces nanomechanical sensors and their applications. All molecules have “volume” and “mass.” Direct measurement of these fundamental parameters can realize label-free and real-time measurements. Nanomechanical sensors have been emerging as a key device for such label-free and real-time measurements with their multiple operation modes; static and dynamic modes for detecting volume- and mass-related features, respectively. A cantilever array sensor is a representative example among various geometries, while structural optimization can enhance the scope of nanomechanical sensors in both academic and industrial applications. One of the most advanced sensing platforms is a membrane-type surface stress sensor (MSS), which realizes both high sensitivity and compact system at the same time. The MSS is also expected to contribute to addressing nanomechanical behavior of living cells and their network.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
