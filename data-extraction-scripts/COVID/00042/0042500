Methods Two hundred ninety-one adult and pediatric patients visiting the emergency department during the 2015–2016 influenza epidemic were prospectively included and immediately tested 24/7 using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel. The results were communicated to the practitioner in charge as soon as they became available. Clinical and biological data were gathered and analyzed. Findings Results from the FilmArray Respiratory Panel do not appear to impact admission or antibiotic prescription, with the exception of a lower admission rate for children who tested positive for influenza B. Parameters that account for the clinical decisions evaluated are CRP level, white blood cell count, suspected or proven bacterial infection and, for adult patients only, signs of respiratory distress. Length of stay is also not significantly different between patients with a positive and a negative result. A rapid influenza test result permits a more appropriate prescription of oseltamivir.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
