The anti-SARS-CoV IgG and the viral RNA were also detected in the sera by ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. During the first 10 days after onset, anti-SARS-CoV IgG, SARS-CoV RNA and the N protein were detected in 21.4, 42.9, and 90% of the patients’ sera, respectively. The detection rate of the N protein during days 11–15 of the disease was still significantly higher than those of anti-SARS-CoV IgG and SARS-CoV RNA. The data demonstrated that detection of the N protein with the capture ECLIA appears to be more useful than detection of other viral makers for rapid diagnosis of SARS in patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
