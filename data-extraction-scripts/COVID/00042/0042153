Potently neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on MERS-CoV spike (S) protein have been characterized, but much less is known about antibodies targeting non-RBD epitopes. Here we report the structural and functional characterization of G2, a neutralizing antibody targeting MERS-CoV S1 N-terminal domain (S1-NTD). Structures of G2 alone and in complex with the MERS-CoV S1-NTD defined a site of vulnerability comprising two loops, each of which contained a residue mutated in G2-escape variants. Cell-surface binding studies and in vitro competition experiments demonstrated that G2 strongly disrupts the attachment of MERS-CoV S to its receptor DDP4, with the inhibition requiring the native trimeric S conformation. These results advance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of coronaviruses and should facilitate development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
