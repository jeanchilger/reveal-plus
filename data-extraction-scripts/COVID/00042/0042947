<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-02-28</DATELINE><TITLE>6. Asthma: Factors underlying inception, exacerbation, and disease progression</TITLE><BODY>Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder that is characterized by variable airflow obstruction, airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, and reversibility either spontaneously or as a result of treatment. Multiple causes no doubt exist for both its inception and symptom exacerbation once the disease is established. Factors underlying inception can range from viral respiratory tract infections in infancy to occupational exposures in adults. Factors underlying asthma exacerbations include allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, viral infections, exercise, irritants, and ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents among others. Exacerbating factors might include one or all of these exposures and vary both among and within patients. Asthma treatment is determined to a large extent after an assessment of severity, which can be variable over time and assessed in 2 domains: impairment (current) and risk (long-term consequences). Unfortunately, despite the availability of effective therapies, suboptimal asthma control exists in many patients on a worldwide basis. The future development of novel therapies and treatment paradigms should address these disparities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
