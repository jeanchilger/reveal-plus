S100A9 is a damage-associated molecular pattern of the S100 protein family. Here, we found that PRRSV infection stimulated S100A9 expression in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and Marc-145 cells. S100A9 inhibited PRRSV replication via cellular Ca2+ dependent manner. The viral nucleocapsid (N) protein co-localized with S100A9 in the cytoplasm, and directly interacted at amino acid 78 of S100A9 and amino acids 36–37 of N protein. Moreover, we also found that the mutant S100A9 (E78Q) protein exhibited decreased antiviral activity against PRRSV compared with the parent S100A9. Recombinant PRRSV rBB (36/37) with two mutations in amino acid 36–37 in the N protein exhibited greater replication than the parent PRRSV BB0907 in S100A9-overexpressed PAM and Marc-145 cells. Thus, S100A9 may restrict PRRSV proliferation by interacting with the viral N protein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
