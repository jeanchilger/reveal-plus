We conducted histologic analysis and immunofluorescence (IF) staining for the detection of PDCoV antigens, and TUNEL assay in singly or serially cut tissue sections from the small and large intestines of four, 11- to 14-day-old gnotobiotic pigs, inoculated orally with 8.8–11.0log10 genomic equivalents (GE) of US PDCoV strains OH-FD22 or OH-FD100 (n =3), or mock (n =1). Similar comparative assays were done on LLC-PK and ST cells inoculated with the cell-adapted PDCoV strain OH-FD22-P44 (passage 44) in cell culture medium with 2.5–10μg/ml of trypsin and 1% pancreatin, respectively. At post-inoculation days 3–4, infected pigs showed severe watery diarrhea and/or vomiting and mainly, diffuse, severe atrophic enteritis, with mild to moderate cytoplasmic vacuolation of the enteroctyes lining the atrophied villous epithelium. By IF, PDCoV antigens were evident in villous or crypt epithelial cells. No PDCoV antigen-positive, small and large intestinal villous or crypt epithelial cells, of which cytoplasm was also either vacuolated or morphologically normal, showed positive TUNEL staining. In contrast, by double IF and TUNEL staining, most of the TUNEL-positive signals (apoptotic nuclear fragmentation) were found in PDCoV antigen-positive LLC-PK and ST cells that also showed cytopathic effects, such as cell rounding, detachment and clumping in clusters. Secondary annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining revealed increased numbers of annexin V- or PI-positive LLC-PK and ST cells at 21h after inoculation, compared to the negative controls. Thus, PDCoV does not induce apoptosis in the infected intestinal enterocytes in vivo, but in two infected cell lines of swine origin, LLC-PK and ST cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
