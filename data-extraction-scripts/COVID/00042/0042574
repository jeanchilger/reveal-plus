The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinic-microbiological features of patients with CAP presenting with ground-glass opacity (GGO) and centrilobular nodules or tree-in-bud pattern on CT images. METHODS: Patients with CAP who underwent a CT scan at presentation were retrospectively classified using CT findings into consolidation, GGO and bronchiolitis groups. These 3 groups were compared in terms of clinical parameters and microbiological data. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients (2.4%) were allocated to the bronchiolitis group and 46 (2.8%) to the GGO group. The most common pathogen in the bronchiolitis group was Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which was significantly more frequently isolated in this group. The bronchiolitis group was characterized by a higher percentage of cough, a lower percentage of chest pain and lower blood levels of inflammatory markers. Common pathogens in the GGO group were not significantly different from those in the other 2 groups. Unlike that observed in the consolidation group, complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema was not observed in the bronchiolitis or GGO group. Outcome variables were similar in the 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The bronchiolitis group was characterized by a higher frequency of M. pneumoniae and a less severe form of CAP. The GGO and consolidation groups was similar with respect to causative microorganisms and the clinical features of CAP. No patient in the bronchiolitis or GGO group exhibited complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
