First of all, we show that there is a unique positive solution, which is a prerequisite for analyzing the long-term behavior of the stochastic model. Then, a threshold dynamic determined by the basic reproduction number R 0 s is established: the disease can be eradicated almost surely if R 0 s < 1 and under mild extra conditions, whereas if R 0 s > 1 , the densities of the distributions of the solution can converge in L 1 to an invariant density by using the Markov semigroups theory. Finally, based on realistic parameters obtained from previous literatures, numerical simulations have been performed to verify our analytical results.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
