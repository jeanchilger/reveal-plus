<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-12-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Change in bacterial aetiology of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis over 10 years: experience from a centre in south-east Asia</TITLE><BODY>This study reviewed 1787 episodes of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis in 544 patients between 1994 and 2003. The overall rate of peritonitis was 0.68 episodes/year of PD, but decreased from 1.10 to 0.46 episodes/year between 1994 and 2003. The incidence of peritonitis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci declined between 1994 and 1998 from 0.21 to 0.06 episodes/year of PD, coinciding with a reduction in the use of spike PD sets. There was a 60.1% response rate to antibiotics throughout the period, but the percentage of cases that required modification of the initial empirical antibiotic regimen rose from 13.6% to 58.7%, indicating that treatment should be individualised.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
