Structure based virtual screening of 308307 chemical compounds was performed using the computation tool Autodock 3.0.5 on a WISDOM Production Environment. The top 1468 ranked compounds with free binding energy ranging from −14.0 to −17.09kcalmol−1 were selected to check the hydrogen bond interaction with amino acid residues in the active site of 3CLpro. Fifty-three compounds from 35 main groups were tested in an in vitro assay for inhibition of 3CLpro expressed by Escherichia coli. Seven of the 53 compounds were selected; their IC50 ranged from 38.57±2.41 to 101.38±3.27μM. Two strong 3CLpro inhibitors were further identified as competitive inhibitors of 3CLpro with K i values of 9.11±1.6 and 9.93±0.44μM. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions of compound with amino acid residues in the active site of 3CLpro were also identified.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
