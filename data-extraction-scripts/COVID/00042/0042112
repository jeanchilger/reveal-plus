Intact and inactivated virions as well as the nucleocapsid fraction did not differ significantly in their IFN-inducing capacity. In contrast, genomic RNA as well as M protein fraction and envelopes induced IFN titres to a level of about 10% of those achieved with virions. NDV-induced IFN production could be blocked specifically by incubation with polychonal anti-NDV-monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and with two of three anti-HN-mAbs, but not with anti-NDV-mAbs directed against the F, M or NP protein. In addition, IFN induction by fixed MDBK cells, expressing NDV surface proteins after infection with NDV Ulster, was inhibited by one of two anti-F-mAbs. The results suggest that the induction of IFN synthesis in human PBML is a complex process involving not only the HN protein but also the uncleaved F protein precursor, a component of the M protein fraction and — once having entered the cell — the genomic RNA.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
