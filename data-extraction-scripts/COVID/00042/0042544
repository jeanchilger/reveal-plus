Here, we combine these two approaches toprofile RNA recombination within the encapsidated genome of a eukaryotic RNA virus, Flock House Virus. We detect hundreds of thousands of recombination events, with single-nucleotide resolution, which result indiversity in the encapsidated genome rivaling that due to mismatch mutation. We detect previously identified Defective-RNAs as well as many other abundant and novel Defective-RNAs. Our approach is exceptionally sensitive, unbiased, and requires no prior knowledge beyond the virus genome sequence. RNA recombination is a powerful driving force behind the evolution and adaptation of RNA viruses. The strategy implemented here is widely applicable and provides a highly detailed description of the complex mutational landscape of the transmissible viral genome.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
