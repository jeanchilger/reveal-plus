We conducted site-directed mutagenesis to the 3′ UTR of the type II porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Serial deletions of the 3′ UTR showed that at least 40 nucleotides immediately following the ORF7 stop codon were dispensable for the viability of PRRSV in cultured cells. We then constructed a chimeric PRRSV cDNA clone using type II PRRSV as the backbone containing the 3′ UTR from the type I PRRSV. The chimeric virus was viable and shared similar properties with the parental virus. Our results provided the first description of the 40nt dispensable region in type I PRRSV 3′ UTR, and further predicted structure demonstrated that the high-order structure of 3′ UTR might play significant roles in its function.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
