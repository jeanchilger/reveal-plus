These viruses have a positive-stranded RNA genome that is replicated in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. The viral RNA genome is the template for transcription by the virally encoded RNA polymerase and for translation of the viral proteins. Furthermore, the double-stranded RNA intermediates of viral replication are believed to trigger the innate immune response through interaction with cytoplasmic cellular sensors. Therefore, understanding the subcellular distribution and dynamics of Flavivirus RNAs is of paramount importance to understand the interaction of the virus with its cellular host, which could be of insect, tick or mammalian, including human, origin. Recent advances on the visualization of Flavivirus RNA in living cells together with the development of methods to measure the dynamic properties of viral RNA are reviewed and discussed in this essay. In particular the application of bleaching techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) are analysed in the context of tick-borne encephalitis virus replication. Conclusions driven by this approached are discussed in the wider context Flavivirus infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
