Research and diagnostic microbiology laboratories contain a mix of traditional and leading-edge, in-house and commercial assays for the detection of microbes and the effects they impart upon target tissues, organs, and systems. The PCR has undergone significant change over the last decade, to the extent that only a small proportion of scientists have been able or willing to keep abreast of the latest offerings. The chapter reviews these changes. It discusses the second-generation of PCR technology—kinetic or real-time PCR, a tool gaining widespread acceptance in many scientific disciplines but especially in the microbiology laboratory.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
