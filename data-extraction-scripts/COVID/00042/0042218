Automated room disinfection (ARD) systems remove or reduce reliance on operators and so they have the potential to improve the efficacy of terminal disinfection. The most commonly used systems are hydrogen peroxide vapor (H2O2 vapor), aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP), and ultraviolet (UV) light. These systems have important differences in their active agent, delivery mechanism, efficacy, process time, and ease of use. The choice of ARD system should be influenced by the intended application, the evidence base for effectiveness, practicalities of implementation, and cost considerations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
