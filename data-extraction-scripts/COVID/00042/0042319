In this study, canine and feline cells expressing canine SLAM, designated A-72/cSLAM and CRFK/cSLAM, were established for the in vitro study of canine distemper. Recent CDV isolates, KDK-1 and 246, which belong to genotypes Asia/H1 and Asia/H2, respectively, rapidly grew and produced distinct syncytia in both the SLAM-expressing cells. The virus-neutralizing (VN) test was successfully performed using these cells, and the results indicated that sera from dogs experimentally infected with KDK-1 had higher VN titers for homologous strain KDK-1 than for heterologous strain 246 and the vaccine Onderstepoort. These newly established cells expressing canine SLAM would help virological and serological analyses of canine distemper.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
