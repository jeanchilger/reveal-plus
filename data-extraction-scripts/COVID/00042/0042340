Although the patient had an uncomplicated intra- and post-partum course, little is known about the safety of performing neuraxial analgesia or anesthesia in patients with influenza. The prevalence of viremia and possible translocation of blood-borne virus to the central nervous system are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
