To date, there are no effective vaccines or antiviral treatments available that are capable of limiting the pathogenesis of any human coronaviral infection. An attractive target for the development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics is the 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)), which is essential for the progression of the coronaviral life cycle. Herein, we report the screening results of a small, 230-member peptidomimetic library against HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) and the identification of 43 peptidomimetic compounds showing good to excellent inhibitory potency of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) with IC(50) values ranging from low micromolar to sub-micromolar. We established structure-activity relationships (SARs) describing the important ligand-based features required for potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition and identified a seemingly favored peptidic backbone for HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition. To investigate this, a molecular sub-structural analysis of the most potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibitor was accomplished by the synthesis and testing of the lead peptidomimetic inhibitor's sub-structural components, confirming the activity of the favored backbone (22A) identified via SAR analysis. In order to elucidate the structural reasons for such potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition by the peptidomimetics having the 22A backbone, we determined the X-ray structures of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) in complex with three peptidomimetic inhibitors. Sequence alignment of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro), and two other lineage C Betacoronaviruses 3CL(pro)'s, HKU5-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL(pro), show that the active site residues of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) that participate in inhibitor binding are conserved in HKU5-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL(pro). Furthermore, we assayed our most potent HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro) inhibitor for inhibition of HKU5-CoV 3CL(pro) and found it to have sub-micromolar inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 0.54 ± 0.03 μM). The X-ray structures and SAR analysis reveal critical insights into the structure and inhibition of HKU4-CoV 3CL(pro), providing fundamental knowledge that may be exploited in the development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics for coronaviruses emerging from zoonotic reservoirs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
