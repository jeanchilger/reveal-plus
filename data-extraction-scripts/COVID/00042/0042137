We designed and fabricated selected modular fluidic components, including functional and auxiliary types that can be effortlessly swapped and integrated into a variety of modular devices to rapidly assemble a fully-portable, disposable fluidic system. In practice, an integrated SFM uses finger-operated, electricity-free pumps to deliver fluids. Using a swirling mechanism, the vortex mixer can rapidly mix two liquids in a one-shot mixing event. We demonstrate the successful application of this SFM in several microfluidic applications, such as the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) from chloroauric acid (HAuCl4), and nucleic acid amplification from the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) with a capillary convective polymerase chain reaction (ccPCR).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
