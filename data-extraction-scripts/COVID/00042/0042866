The fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrate by colonic flora yields gases (CO2 and H2) and short chain organic acids. These organic acids can disrupt the intestinal mucosa and initiate inflammation driven predominantly by resident mast cells and by granulocytes which are recruited from blood. A systemic acidosis ensues derived from intestinal acids, not classic lactic acidosis produced from anaerobic metabolism. The systemic acidosis further compromises inflamed bowel leading to bowel necrosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
