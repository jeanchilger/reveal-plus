Four major protein species were resolved by electrophoresis and many of their properties were deduced from digestion studies using proteolytic enzymes. The four proteins are: (1) A 190 kDa protein, the presumed peplomeric protein, that was glycosylated and proteolytically cleavable by trypsin into subunits of 110 and 90 kDa. The subunits each represent a different amino acid sequence on the basis of peptide mapping; (2) a 130 kDa protein that was glycosylated and behaved as a disulfide-linked dimer of 65 kDa molecules. It is the apparent virion hemagglutinin on the basis of digestion studies with trypsin, bromelain and pronase; (3) a 55 kDa nucleocapsid protein that was phosphorylated; (4) a 26 kDa matrix protein that was glycosylated. The 190, 130, 55 and 26 kDa species can therefore be designated P, H, N and M, respectively. They exist in molar ratios of 4:1: 33 : 33, and are calculated to be present at the rate of 88, 22, 726, and 726 molecules per virion, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
