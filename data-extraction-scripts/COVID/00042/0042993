Viral RNA was extracted from allantoic fluids and cell cultures infected experimentally with different strains of IBV and from tissues of naturally infected birds. Viral RNA was then amplified and identified by a nested RT-PCR assay using two sets of primers flanking a well-conserved region of the nucleocapsid gene. The selected IBV nucleocapsid sequence was detected successfully by simple direct electrophoresis of amplified material.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
