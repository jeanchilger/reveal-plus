<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Canine and Feline Uveitis</TITLE><BODY>The clinical signs of uveitis occur as a result of inflammation within the vascular coat of the eye, which causes breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier. Many infectious and noninfectious causes can incite episodes of uveitis. Although a complete diagnostic evaluation is highly recommended to identify any underlying etiologic agent, many cases remain idiopathic in nature. The goals of therapy are preserving vision, minimizing pain, and halting inflammation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
