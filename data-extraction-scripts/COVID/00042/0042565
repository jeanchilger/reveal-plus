Here, we described specific silencing of five white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) genes in Litopenaeus vannamei in vivo with sequence-specific siRNAs. These genes included DNA polymerase (dnapol), ribonucleotide reductase small subunit (rr2), thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase (tk-tmk), vp24 and vp28. At 6 days post-challenged, the relative survival rates of shrimp injected with siDNApol, siRR2, siTK-TMK, siVP24 and siVP28 (siRNAs for dnapol, rr2, tk-tmk, vp24 and vp28 genes) reached 50%, 50%, 66%, 33% and 33%, respectively. Specific siRNAs of the five WSSV genes could result in suppression of the target genes and a significant reduction in the viral proliferation. In negative controls, sequence-independent siRNA (mutant siRNA) could not inhibit expression of these five genes or viral replication. Consequently, injection of sequence-dependent siRNA could induce anti-WSSV activity in shrimp. These results suggest that siRNA can suppress WSSV efficiently in shrimp, and it may provide a potential approach to the therapy of aquaculture viral disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
