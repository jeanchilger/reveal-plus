In approximately half of the cases no other enteropathogens were detected. However, only 73% of 30 laboratories participating in a questionnaire survey routinely tested for this parasite, and the majority of researchers considered cryptosporidiosis to be of minor importance. In a placebo-controlled field study 152 suckling calves were treated daily against cryptosporidiosis either with sulfadimidine or with halofuginone (Halocur®, Intervet) over 1 week. Treatment by oral drench started at the onset of diarrhoea in the herd. Oocyst excretion, faecal consistency and health status were recorded five times for a 3-week period. Oocyst excretion peaked 7–14 days in the placebo group after the onset of diarrhoea, and during that period prevalence and intensity of excretion were significantly lower in the halofuginone-treated group compared to the sulfadimidine and the placebo control groups. The health status (diarrhoea, dehydration) declined in all groups but was significantly (P<0.05–0.001) better in the halofuginone group in the first 2 weeks. Halofuginone effectively (P<0.05–0.001) reduced oocyst excretion and improved the health status of the treated animals, while sulfadimidine had no effect against Cryptosporidium.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
