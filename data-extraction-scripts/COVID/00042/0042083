Materials and Methods In Sprague-Dawley rats, partial cystectomy (>50%) was performed, followed by BAMG augmentation cystoplasty. After 4 months, organ bath studies of tissue strips in 10 were used to compare the contractility of the BAMG regenerates and the corresponding host detrusor smooth muscle. Results The BAMG regenerates exhibited contractile activity to electrical field stimulation and a qualitatively identical pattern of response to muscarinic, purinergic, alpha- and beta-adrenergic drug administration and nitric oxide. At 4 months after surgery, the maximum forces of contraction of the BAMG regenerates to carbachol stimulation amounted to close to 80% of the host bladder response. With electrical field stimulation, they equaled 44% and 62% of the host bladder response after 2.5 and 4 months, respectively. Histological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of receptors for neurotransmitters that these functional in vitro studies implied. Conclusions The present study provides further evidence that augmentation cystoplasty with the BAMG leads to functional regeneration of the rat bladder detrusor smooth muscle.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
