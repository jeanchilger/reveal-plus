YOKV belongs to the Entebbe bat virus group of vector unknown group within the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae. To detect antibodies against YOKV, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using biotinylated anti-bat IgG rabbit sera. Serological surveillance was conducted with samples collected in the Philippines and the sera supplied from Malaysia. One of the 36 samples from the Philippines (2.7%) and 5 of the 26 samples from Malaysia (19%) had detectable ELISA antibodies. In the experimental infections, no clinical signs of disease were observed. Moreover, no significant viral genome amplification was detected. These findings revealed that YOKV replicates poorly in the fruit bat, suggesting that fruit bats do not seem to serve as an amplifying host for YOKV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
