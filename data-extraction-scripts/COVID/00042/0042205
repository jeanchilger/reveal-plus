Accurate identification of the etiologic agent of respiratory tract infections is important for proper patient management. Diagnosis can be problematic, because a range of potential pathogens can cause similar clinical symptoms. Nucleic acid amplification testing is emerging as the preferred method of diagnostic testing. Real-time technology and the ability to perform multiplex testing have facilitated this emergence. Commercial platforms for nucleic acid amplification testing of respiratory viruses include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Multiplex PCR with fluidic microarrays or DNA chips are the most recent diagnostic advance. These assays offer significant advantages in sensitivity over antigen detection methods and in most cases also over traditional culture methods. A limited number of assays, however, are commercially available, thus laboratory developed assays frequently are used. This article reviews the performance of commercially available assays and discusses issues relevant to the development of in-house assays.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
