<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-05-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Group-specific structural features of the 5′-proximal sequences of coronavirus genomic RNAs</TITLE><BODY>Global predictions of the secondary structure of coronavirus (CoV) 5′ untranslated regions and adjacent coding sequences revealed the presence of conserved structural elements. Stem loops (SL) 1, 2, 4, and 5 were predicted in all CoVs, while the core leader transcription-regulating sequence (L-TRS) forms SL3 in only some CoVs. SL5 in group I and II CoVs, with the exception of group IIa CoVs, is characterized by the presence of a large sequence insertion capable of forming hairpins with the conserved 5′-UUYCGU-3′ loop sequence. Structure probing confirmed the existence of these hairpins in the group I Human coronavirus-229E and the group II Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In general, the pattern of the 5′ cis-acting elements is highly related to the lineage of CoVs, including features of the conserved hairpins in SL5. The function of these conserved hairpins as a putative packaging signal is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
