These are physiologic responses to PS but the Ebola virus displays PS molecules on its membrane’s surface and the huge numbers of viruses cause a pathologic inflammatory cytokine storm and a hemorrhagic consumptive coagulopathy. Annexin V is an innate molecule that can cloak membrane displayed PS and prevents its Th1 cell’s inflammatory cytokine generation and cascade thrombin generation. The hypothesis presented is that its administration will cloak PS and prevent Ebola’s consumptive coagulopathy and its cytokine storm.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
