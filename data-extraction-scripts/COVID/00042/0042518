It was found that 100% of the cells in the passaged cultures were positive for viral antigen throughout the course of the experiment. Additionally, supernatants collected upon passaging of the cells continuously contained high titers of infectious virus. In six separate cultures persistently infected with either the biological clones or the recombinant virus, a cytopathic effect occurred spontaneously between passage 8 and 94. The cytopathogenic agent in the supernatants of these cultures could be passaged repeatedly, suggesting the generation of a mutant virus. Analysis of RNA from such cultures revealed the presence of a subgenomic viral RNA of approximately 8 kilobases (kb). In all six cases, this RNA had an identical internal deletion of 4764 nucleotides, including the region coding for all structural proteins. The subgenomic RNA replicated and was packaged in the presence of wild-type virus. Cells infected with cytopathogenic virus contained increased amounts of the viral protein NS3 thought to be involved in pestivirus cytopathogenicity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
