The aim of this study was to determine if PEDV can be shed in semen from SPF (specific pathogens free) boars infected by a French S-InDel PEDV strain (PEDV/FR/001/2014) and in case of positive semen to determine the infectivity of that semen. Both infected boars had diarrhea after inoculation and shed virus in feces. PEDV genome was also detected by RT-qPCR in the sperm-rich fraction of semen (6.94 × 103 and 4.73 × 103 genomic copies/mL) from the two boars infected with the S-InDel PEDV strain but only once at 7DPI. In addition, PEDV RNA in Peyer’s patches and in mesenteric lymph nodes was also present for the two inoculated boars. The PEDV positive semen (S-non-InDel and S-InDel) sampled during a previous trial and in this boar trial were inoculated to six SPF weaned pigs. The inoculated piglets did not seroconvert and did not shed virus throughout the duration of the study except for one pig at 18 DPI. But, PEDV could be detected in intestinal tissues such as duodenum, jejunum and jejunum Peyer’s patches by RT-qPCR except for one pig. Even if PEDV genome has been detected in semen, experimental infection of piglets with positive semen failed to conclude to the infectivity of the detected PEDV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
