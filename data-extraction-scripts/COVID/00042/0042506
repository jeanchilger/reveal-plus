However, setting up individual PCRs for all respiratory viruses is not practical so preferentially multiplex PCRs are used. Objectives: To develop for routine diagnosis a rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of hRV and hMPV including an internal control in a single tube multiplex reaction using probes carrying different fluorophores to discriminate targets. Study design: The multiplex real-time RNA PCR was optimized to include the internal control virus and a total of 358 respiratory samples from 239 patients taken over a one-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay. Results: The multiplex assay with co-amplification of the internal control was as sensitive and specific as the individual assays. Application of this assay on clinical samples from 239 patients in a one-year period resulted in an incidence of hRV and hMPV of 41/239 (17.1%) and 6/239 (2.5%), respectively. Inhibition, defined as poor internal control amplification, was detected in 8 (2.2%) samples. Culture was performed on these samples and only four hRV were detected. Conclusions: This real-time PCR method enables sensitive diagnosis of these two respiratory pathogens with the potential to expand the assay as part of a full molecular respiratory viral screen.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
