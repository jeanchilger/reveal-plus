The mechanisms used by viruses to cause arrest vary widely; some involve the activation of the cellular pathways that induce arrest in response to DNA damage, while others use completely novel means. The analysis of virus-mediated arrest has not been proven easy, and in most cases the consequences of arrest for the virus life cycle are not well defined. However, a number of effects of arrest are being investigated and it will be interesting to see to what extent perturbation of the G2/M transition is involved in viral infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
