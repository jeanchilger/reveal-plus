In the ArkDPI strain, Y43H and ∆344 are the two most common changes observed. This study aims to examine the roles of Y43H and ∆344 in selection in vivo. Using recombinant ArkDPI S1 proteins, we conducted binding assays on chicken tracheas and embryonic chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Protein histochemistry showed that the Y43H change allows for enhanced binding to trachea, whereas the ArkDPI S1 spike with H43 alone was able to bind CAM. Using Western blot under denaturing conditions, ArkDPI serotype-specific sera did not bind to S1 proteins with ∆344, suggesting that ∆344 alters antigenicity of S1. These findings are important because they propose that specific changes in S1 enhances virus fitness by more effective binding to host tissues (Y43H) and by evading a vaccine-induced antibody response (∆344).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
