Therefore, demands of animal protein consumption are increasing worldwide at an extraordinary rate. In order to meet the protein demand, intensive animal and aquaculture farming are considered. Like livestock farming (poultry, pigs, sheep, livestock, horses, rabbits, etc.), aquaculture farming (fish, crustaceans, mollusks, etc.) is also becoming the globe's emergent protein production sector. More than 580 aquaculture species are farmed worldwide. Current food animal and aquaculture farming are coupled with standard usage of antimicrobials. The antimicrobial drugs are major solutions for the management of contagious illnesses in food animals and aquaculture. In animal husbandry, antimicrobials are widely utilized for animal therapy, prophylaxis, or as growth promoters. Imprudent usage of these antimicrobials in food animals and aquaculture is a major contributing factor in the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The widespread use of veterinary medicines is considered to signify a frightening population health threat. It not only results in the disclosure and escalation of resistant microbes but also causes other individual, animal, and ecological deterioration. The contribution of resistant microbes from various sources seems to be the major base of resistance in the environment. However, strict policies and regulations for antimicrobial usage in food animals and aquaculture must be made and applied. It is important to prevent their negative effects in humans, food animals, aquaculture, and the environment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
