<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-02-26</DATELINE><TITLE>The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Appearance of Monophasic Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis: An Update Post Application of the 2007 Consensus Criteria</TITLE><BODY>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immunologically mediated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that typically occurs after a viral infection or recent vaccination, and is most commonly seen in the pediatric population. In 2007 the International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group proposed a consensus definition for ADEM for application in research and clinical settings. This article gives an overview of ADEM in children, focusing on differences that have emerged since the consensus definition was established. Although the focus is on neuroimaging in these patients, a synopsis of the clinical features, immunopathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis of ADEM is provided.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
