The selected acute phase proteins were fibrinogen, haptoglobin, serum amyloid-A, lipopolysaccharide binding protein and α1-acid glycoprotein. From each calf, a paired blood sample was obtained for serological studies of bovine parainfluenza virus-3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine adenovirus-3 and bovine adenovirus-7. Tracheobronchial lavage was performed to detect bacteria and mycoplasma. Isolation of Pasteurella multocida was associated with increased concentrations of all tested acute phase proteins. For other pathogens, no significant relationships were observed. No association was present between viral or bacterial findings and WBC count.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
