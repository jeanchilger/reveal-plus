In the present study, we validated a ‘second-generation’ parallel sequencing platform for viral detection in swab samples collected during recent influenza virus infections in Beijing. This operation yielded millions of valid reads per sample and resulted in an almost complete spectrum of nucleotide information. Importantly, novel A (H1N1) and seasonal A (H3N2) influenza virus-derived sequences were detected without prior knowledge or use of genetic information in advance, suggesting that this approach could be a valuable tool for diagnosing emerging infectious diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
