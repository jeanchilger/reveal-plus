<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-09-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Bronquiectasias</TITLE><BODY>Bronchiectasis is defined as irreversible dilatation of the bronchial lumen. Bronchiectasis not due to cystic fibrosis is the third most common chronic inflammatory disease of the airway, after asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CPOD). The pathogenesis of the disease is characterised by chronic dilatation, with irreversible and usually progressive destruction of the bronchial wall as a consequence of the vicious pathogenic circle described by E. Cole, of infection, inflammation, injury to the mucociliary system, and cyclical repair of the airway. The disease can have different causes, and usually presents with cough and chronic expectoration, and repeated, acute, infectious exacerbations. Suspected diagnosis is clinical, and must be confirmed by high resolution computerised tomography. The treatment comprises diverse regimens aimed at controlling infection and bronchial inflammation. Nutritional aspects should be considered as part of treatment, as well as the management of secretions, muscle training and the management of complications and comorbidities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
