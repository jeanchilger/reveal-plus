This study provides functional evidence for a direct access of peptides to the human brain after intranasal administration. Effects were compared of intranasal (IN, 10 μg) and intravenous (IV, 0.25 and 2.5 μg) administered cholecystokinin-8 (CCK) on the auditory event related potential (AERP) in 20 healthy subjects. Also, plasma concentration of cortisol and ACTH were monitored. The study was designed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind within-subject cross-over comparison. AERPs were recorded while the subject performed on an attention task (oddball task). Plasma CCK concentrations after IN administration of CCK were comparable to those after IV administration of 0.25 μg CCK, but were substantially lower than those after 2.5 μg CCK. The P3 complex of the AERP was markedly increased following the IN administration of CCK (p < .01) compared to placebo and to the IV administration of 0.25 μg This pattern was more obvious in women than men. Increases in plasma ACTH concentrations after CCK reached significance selectively following the IN mode of administration (p < .01).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
