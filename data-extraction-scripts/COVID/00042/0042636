The crystal structure of the fusion protein core of Mumps virus (MuV) was determined at 2.2Å resolution. The complex is a six-helix bundle in which three HR1 peptides form a central highly hydrophobic coiled-coil and three HR2 peptides pack against the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of central coiled-coil in an oblique antiparallel manner. Fusion core of MuV, like those of simian virus 5 and human respiratory syncytium virus, forms typical 3-4-4-4-3 spacing. The similar charecterization in HR1 regions, as well as the existence of O–X–O motif in extended regions of HR2 helix, suggests a basic rule for the formation of the fusion core of viral fusion proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
