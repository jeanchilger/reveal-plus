We therefore explored the association between age, respiratory viruses, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and cytokines/chemokines in acute exacerbations of childhood asthma. Methods We investigated viruses in nasal secretions from 88 patients with acute exacerbation of childhood asthma by using antigen detection kits and/or RT-PCR, followed by direct DNA sequencing analysis. We also measured peripheral eosinophil counts, and the serum levels of ECP and 27 types of cytokines/chemokines in 71 virus-induced acute asthma cases and 13 controls. Results Viruses were detected in 71(80.7%) of the 88 samples. The three major viruses detected were rhinoviruses, RS viruses, and enteroviruses; enteroviruses were found to be dominant in patients aged ≥3 years. There was no change in the levels of rhinoviruses and RS viruses between the two age groups, defined as children aged <3 years and children aged ≥3 years. Serum concentrations of ECP, IL-5, and IP-10 were significantly elevated in virus-induced acute asthma cases compared with controls. Serum ECP values were significantly higher in patients with virus-induced asthma at age ≥3 years compared with those aged <3 years. Among the 27 cytokines/chemokines, serum IP-10 was significantly higher in virus-induced asthma in patients <3 years than in those ≥3 years. Serum ECP and IL-5 production correlated significantly with age, whereas serum IP-10 showed an inverse correlation with age. Conclusions Age-related differences in cytokine profiles and eosinophil activation may be related to virus-induced acute exacerbations of childhood asthma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
