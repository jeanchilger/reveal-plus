Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 50 sepsis patients and 50 controls were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNF-α to induce DCs maturation. DCs from sepsis patients were also treated with three different concentrations of OXPAPC. Cells were characterized with optical and electron microscopy, FACS analysis for CD1α, HLA-DR and CD86 on cell surface and ELISA analysis of IL-12p70 in the supernatant. Results: DCs from sepsis patients had smaller cell bodies and nucleus and had almost no surface projection. DCs had similar CD1α expression in sepsis patients (86.37 ± 17.24) and controls (88.58 ± 10.05). HLA-DR expression was dramatically reduced in sepsis patients (2.74 ± 5.15) compared to controls (198.35 ± 12.04). Similarly, CD86 expression was also drastically lower in sepsis patients (14.72 ± 4.83) than controls (154.56 ± 11.56). Furthermore, OXPAPC treatment of DCs from sepsis patients increased cell surface projection, HLA-DR and CD86 surface expression and IL-12p70 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. With 40 μg/ml of OXPAPC, DCs of sepsis patients have similar phenotypes observed in healthy controls. Conclusion: DCs from sepsis patients are defective in maturation and cytokine secretion and these defects can be corrected by OXPAPC treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
