Mapping the avian infectious bronchitis virus intracellular RNA species to the genome.</TITLE><BODY>Avian infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus, directed the synthesis of six major single-stranded polyadenylated RNA species in infected chicken embryo kidney cells. These RNAs include the intracellular form of the genome (RNA F) and five smaller RNA species (RNAs A, B, C, D, and E). Species A, B, C, and D are subgenomic RNAs and together with the genome form a nested sequence set, with the sequences of each RNA contained within every larger RNA species (D. F. Stern and S. I. T. Kennedy, J. Virol 34:665-674, 1980). In the present paper we show by RNase T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting that RNA E is also a member of the nested set. Partial alkaline fragmentation of the genome followed by sucrose fractionation, oligodeoxythymidylate-cellulose chromatography, and RNase T1 fingerprinting gave a partial 3'-to-5' oligonucleotide spot order. A comparison of the oligonucleotides of each of the five subgenomic RNAs with this spot order established that all of the RNAs are comprised of nucleotide sequences inward from the 3' end of the genome. This result is discussed in relation to the multiplication strategy both of coronaviruses and of other RNA-containing viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
