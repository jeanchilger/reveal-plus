<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1998-05-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Identification and Characterization of a Porcine Torovirus</TITLE><BODY>A porcine torovirus (PoTV) was identified and characterized; it is a novel member of the genus Torovirus (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales), closely related to but clearly distinct from the already recognized equine torovirus (ETV) and bovine torovirus (BoTV) representatives. Immunoelectron microscopy of feces from piglets revealed elongated, 120- by 55-nm particles which were recognized by a torovirus-specific antiserum. Amplification by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR with primers designed to detect conserved regions (on the basis of the genomes of BoTV strain Breda and ETV strain Berne) resulted in the identification of the 489-bp nucleocapsid gene, encoding a 18.7-kDa protein. The sequence identity in this region between PoTV and both ETV and BoTV was only about 68%, whereas the latter two show 81% identity. Neutralizing antibodies directed against ETV were found in sera of adult and young pigs. In all 10 herds sampled, seropositive animals were present, and 81% of randomly selected adult sows possessed antibodies. A longitudinal study with RT PCR showed that piglets shed virus in the feces for 1 or more days, starting 4 to 14 days after weaning.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
