Also isolated were 18 strains of mumps virus, 7 coronaviruses and 295 streptococci of groups A, C or G. Fluctuations were observed in the frequency with which respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 2, and the adenoviruses were isolated over the 10-year period. Influenza viruses types A and B, parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 2, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses types 3, 4, 6, 7 and 21, and many enteroviruses were all associated with outbreaks. Infections with influenza viruses A and B and parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 2 came during the winter, whereas those with parainfluenza virus type 3, enteroviruses, and rhinoviruses were more frequently seen in the summer and early autumn.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
