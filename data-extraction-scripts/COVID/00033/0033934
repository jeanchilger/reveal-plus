The N-terminal 25-amino acid sequence of immunoaffinity-purified MHV receptor was identical to the predicted mature N termini of two mouse genes related to human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and was strongly homologous to the N termini of members of the CEA family in humans and rats. Polyclonal antibodies to human CEA recognized the immunoaffinity-purified MHV receptor and the MHV receptor in liver membranes and intestinal brush border membranes from MHV-susceptible mouse strains. In membranes from MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, the anti-CEA antibodies recognized a homologous glycoprotein that failed to bind MHV. The MHV receptor glycoprotein was detected in membranes of BALB/c colon, small intestine, and liver, which are the principal targets for MHV replication in vivo. The MHV receptor glycoprotein resembled members of the human CEA family in molecular weight, acidic pI, extensive glycosylation, solubility in perchloric acid, and tissue distribution. Thus, the MHV receptor is, to our knowledge, the first member of the CEA family of glycoproteins to be identified as a virus receptor.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
