Virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by self-assembly of individual rotavirus structural proteins coexpressed by baculovirus recombinants in insect cells were the subunit vaccine tested. We first compared the immunogenicities and protective efficacies of VLPs containing VP2 and VP6 (2/6-VLPs) and G3 2/6/7-VLPs mixed with cholera toxin and administered by oral and intranasal routes in the adult mouse model of rotavirus infection. VLPs administered orally induced serum antibody and intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG. The highest oral dose (100 microg) of VLPs induced protection from rotavirus challenge (> or = 50% reduction in virus shedding) in 50% of the mice. VLPs administered intranasally induced higher serum and intestinal antibody responses than VLPs administered orally. All mice receiving VLPs intranasally were protected from challenge; no virus was shed after challenge. Since there was no difference in immunogenicity or protective efficacy between 2/6- and 2/6/7-VLPs, protection was achieved without inclusion of the neutralization antigens VP7 and VP4. We also tested the immunogenicities and protective efficacies of 2/6-VLPs administered intranasally without the addition of cholera toxin. 2/6-VLPs administered intranasally without cholera toxin induced lower serum and intestinal antibody titers than 2/6-VLPs administered with cholera toxin. The highest dose (100 microg) of 2/6-VLPs administered intranasally without cholera toxin resulted in a mean reduction in shedding of 38%. When cholera toxin was added, higher levels of protection were achieved with 10-fold less immunogen. VLPs administered mucosally offer a promising, safe, nonreplicating vaccine for rotavirus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
