Methods: We tested the potential clinical samples using the automated molecular assay which included rapid influenza diagnostic test, Rapid Immunochromatographic Antigen Test, Verigene Respiratory Virus Plus Nucleic Acid Test, BD Veritor(TM) System for Rapid Detection of RSV in the paediatric setting for diagnosis of influenza and respiratory syntactical virus infections when testing was done by the paediatrician seeing the patient. Results: Principally, with respect influenza virus specificity and sensitivity for RIAT were 100% and 68.8%; compared to 100% and 100%, respectively for RV(+). The specificity and sensitivity for 92.23% and 98% for BD Veritor(TM) System for Rapid Detection of RSV as compared to 96.6% and 98.42% for RIDT. Conclusion: Therefore, this study confirms the clinical utility of RV(+) in the pediatric setting.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
