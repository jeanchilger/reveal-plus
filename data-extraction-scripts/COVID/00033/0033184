The objective of this research was to characterize the respiratory excretion of these pathogens by acutely infected pigs. Pigs were inoculated under experimental conditions with 1 pathogen. Samples were collected from the upper respiratory tract and exhaled air. All pathogens were detected in swabs of the upper respiratory tract, but only M. hyopneumoniae and B. bronchiseptica were detected in expired air from individually sampled, acutely infected pigs. These findings suggest either that the acutely infected pigs did not aerosolize the viruses or that the quantity of virus excreted was below the detection threshold of current sampling or assay systems, or both, at the individual-pig level.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
