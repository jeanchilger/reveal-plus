Genomic DI RNA and subgenomic DI RNA accumulated at a constant ratio from 3 to 11 h postinfection (p.i.) in the cells infected with MHV-containing DI particles. Earlier, at 1 h p.i., this ratio was not constant; only genomic DI RNA accumulated, indicating that MHV RNA replication, but not MHV RNA transcription, was active during the first hour of MHV infection. Negative-strand genomic DI RNA and negative-strand subgenomic DI RNA were first detectable at 1 and 3 h p.i., respectively, and the amounts of both RNAs increased gradually until 6 h p.i. These data showed that at 2 h p.i., subgenomic DI RNA was undergoing synthesis in the cells in which negative-strand subgenomic DI RNA was undetectable. These data, therefore, signify that negative-strand genomic DI RNA, but not negative-strand subgenomic DI RNA, was an active template for subgenomic DI RNA synthesis early in infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
