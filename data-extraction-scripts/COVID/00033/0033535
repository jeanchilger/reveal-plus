Antibodies to HEV 67N strain and HCV OC43 strain were highly prevalent with positivity rates of 82.1 and 91.4%, respectively, while seropositivity rate to BCV Kakegawa strain was 44.2%. No clinical signs of HEV infection were noticed in any farms including farms with relatively high seropositivity. The results suggested that HCV or antigenitically related virus(es) as well as HEV might be perpetuated in swine in the Tohoku District.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
