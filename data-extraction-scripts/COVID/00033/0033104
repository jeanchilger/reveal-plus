During replication, arteriviruses produce a 3′ coterminal, nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs). These sgRNAs arise by discontinuous transcription, and each contains a 5′ leader sequence which is joined to the body of the mRNA through a conserved junction sequence. Only the 5′-most open reading frame (ORF) is believed to be transcribed from each sgRNA. The SHFV genome encodes nine ORFs that are presumed to be expressed from sgRNAs. However, reverse transcription-PCR analysis with leader- and ORF-specific primers identified only eight sgRNA species. The consensus sequence 5′-UCNUUAACC-3′ was identified as the junction motif. Our data suggest that sgRNA 2 may be bicistronic, expressing both ORF 2a and ORF 2b. SHFV encodes three more ORFs on its genome than the other arteriviruses. Comparative sequence analysis suggested that SHFV ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3 are related to ORFs 2 through 4 of the other arteriviruses. Evidence which suggests that SHFV ORFs 4 through 6 are related to ORFs 2a through 3 and may have resulted from a recombination event during virus evolution is presented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
