In order to determine the amino acid sequences surrounding the p28 cleavage site, the first 4.6 kb of murine hepatitis virus strain A59 ORF1a was expressed in a cell-free transcription-translation system. Amino-terminal radiosequencing of the resulting downstream cleavage product demonstrated that cleavage occurs between Gly-247 and Val-248. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids surrounding the p28 cleavage site revealed that substitutions of Arg-246 (P2) and Gly-247 (P1) nearly eliminated cleavage of p28. Single-amino-acid substitutions of other residues between P7 and P2' were generally permissive for cleavage, although a few changes did greatly reduce proteolysis. The relationship between the p28 cleavage site and other viral and cellular papain proteinase cleavage sites is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
