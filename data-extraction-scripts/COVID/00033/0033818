The nucleotide sequence of the 3' end of the genome was found to be highly conserved (93% identical) between BRV and Berne virus, the torovirus prototype. Cross-hybridization experiments were performed to select Berne virus cDNA clones for use as probes in a dot hybridization assay; the objective was to detect heterologous torovirus RNA in fecal material. A rapid RNA extraction method was employed to make the test applicable for routine diagnosis. Samples from calves after experimental and natural infection with BRV were assayed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of the test and to compare the test with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antigen detection. For this purpose, 53 samples from seven infected calves were tested with both methods. In the ELISA, BRV was detected in six fecal samples from three inoculated calves. By use of the hybridization test, 16 samples from seven calves reacted positively. With one exception, only postinoculation samples were found positive in hybridization. No signal was seen in feces from uninoculated calves or from calves infected with rotavirus or coronavirus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
