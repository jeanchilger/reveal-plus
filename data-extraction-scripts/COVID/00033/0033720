During this process, mRNAs are generated that represent the genomic 5′ sequence, the so-called leader RNA, fused at specific positions to different 3′ regions of the genome. The fusion of the leader to the mRNA bodies occurs at a short, conserved sequence element, the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS), which precedes every transcription unit in the genome and is also present at the 3′ end of the leader sequence. Here, we have used site-directed mutagenesis of the infectious cDNA clone of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus to show that sg mRNA synthesis requires a base-pairing interaction between the leader TRS and the complement of a body TRS in the viral negative strand. Mutagenesis of the body TRS of equine arteritis virus RNA7 reduced sg RNA7 transcription severely or abolished it completely. Mutations in the leader TRS dramatically influenced the synthesis of all sg mRNAs. The construction of double mutants in which a mutant leader TRS was combined with the corresponding mutant RNA7 body TRS resulted in the specific restoration of mRNA7 synthesis. The analysis of the mRNA leader–body junctions of a number of mutants with partial transcriptional activity provided support for a mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand transcription that resembles similarity-assisted, copy-choice RNA recombination.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
