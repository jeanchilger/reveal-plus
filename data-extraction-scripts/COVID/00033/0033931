Tryptic peptide mapping was used to determine the structural relationships of the intracellular proteins to the virion polypeptides. Pulse-chase experiments were performed to identify precursors to the virus-specific proteins. We found that the nucleocapsid protein, P51, and the small viral membrane proteins GP31, GP28, and P23 do not undergo post-translational proteolytic processing. In contrast, GP90 and GP84, the two large virion membrane proteins, were found to be produced by cleavage of a single precursor, GP155. This demonstrated that at least one coronavirus mRNA specifies two virion proteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
