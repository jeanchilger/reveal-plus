Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from spleens of 18-h LDV-infected mice. The RNAs were analyzed by Northern (RNA) blot hybridization with a number of LDV-specific cDNAs as probes. A cDNA representing the nucleocapsid protein (VP-1) gene located at the 3' terminus of the viral genome (E. K. Godeny, D. W. Speicher, and M. A. Brinton, Virology 177:768-771, 1990) hybridized to viral genomic RNA of about 13 kb plus seven subgenomic RNAs ranging in size from about 1 to about 3.6 kb. Two other cDNA clones hybridized only to the four or five largest subgenomic RNAs, respectively. In contrast, two cDNAs encoding continuous open reading frames with replicase and zinc finger motifs hybridized only to the genomic RNA. The replicase motif exhibited 75% amino acid identity to that of the 1b protein of equine arteritis virus (EAV) and 44% amino acid identity to those of the 1b proteins of coronaviruses and Berne virus. Combined, the results indicate that LDV replication involves formation of a 3'-coterminal-nested set of mRNAs as observed for coronaviruses and toroviruses as well as for EAV, with which LDV shares many other properties. Overall, LDV, like EAV, possesses a genome organization resembling that of the coronaviruses and toroviruses. However, EAV and LDV differ from the latter in the size of their genomes, virion size and structure, nature of the structural proteins, and symmetry of the nucleocapsids.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
