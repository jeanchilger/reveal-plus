A recombinant form of nsp10, MBP-nsp10, was produced in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein. The protein was partially purified by affinity chromatography and shown to have ATPase activity that was strongly stimulated by poly(dT), poly(U), and poly(dA) but not by poly(G). The protein also had both RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities that required the presence of 5′ single-stranded regions on the partial-duplex substrates, indicating a 5′-to-3′ polarity in the unwinding reaction. Results of this study suggest a close functional relationship between the arterivirus nsp10 and the coronavirus helicase, for which NTPase and duplex-unwinding activities were recently demonstrated. In a number of biochemical properties, both arterivirus and coronavirus SF1 helicases differ significantly from the previously characterized RNA virus SF1 and SF2 enzymes. Thus, the combined data strongly support the idea that nidovirus helicases may represent a separate group of RNA virus-encoded helicases with distinct properties.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
