<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1989-03-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Detection of rotavirus and coronavirus shedding in two beef cow herds in Idaho</TITLE><BODY>Fecal samples were taken at the time of pregnancy examinations and at parturition from two beef herds. They were also taken from sick calves at the onset of disease, and from 25% of the healthy calves at 15 days of age. All fecal samples were examined by electron microscopy for viruses. Four cows in herd A were detected excreting coronavirus, one at the time of the pregnancy examinations and three at parturition. The first cow was removed from the herd and the others calved at the end of the season. There were no sick calves. No cows in herd B were detected excreting virus at the time of pregnancy checks, but fourteen coronavirus and two rotavirus carrier cows were found at parturition. All but two calves sampled had large numbers of virus particles in their feces. Clinical illness was associated with dams shedding virus and with nightly low temperatures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
