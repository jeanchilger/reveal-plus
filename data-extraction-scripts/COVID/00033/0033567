We investigated the inhibitory effects of the MxA protein on measles virus (MV) and VSV in the human monocytic cell line U937. In transfected U937 clones which constitutively express MxA (U937/MxA), the release of infectious MV and VSV was reduced approximately 100-fold in comparison with control titers. Transcription of VSV was inhibited similar to that observed for 3T3/MxA cells, whereas no difference was detected for MV in the rates of transcription or the levels of MV-specific mRNAs. In contrast, analysis of MV protein expression by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation revealed a significant reduction in the synthesis of MV glycoproteins F and H in U937/MxA cells. These data demonstrate a virus-specific effect of MxA which may, in the case of MV, contribute to the establishment of a persistent infection in human monocytic cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
