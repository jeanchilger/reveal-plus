The stool samples of 426 children (213 diarrhoeal and 213 non-diarrhoeal controls) were investigated by electron microscopy and ELISA for the presence of viruses. Six morphologically distinct viruses were visualized: rotavirus, coronavirus-like particles (CVLP), adenovirus, astrovirus, calicivirus and small round virus-like particles (SRV). Rotavirus was detected in 28.6% of the diarrhoeal patients and in 1.4% of the controls. The frequency of infection with rotavirus was highest in the children aged less than 5 years. The mean age of rotavirus-positive patients was 11 months. Although rotavirus was detected in almost every month, there has a seasonal trend for colder months when CVLP cases were fewest. However, the prevalence of CVLP was greater in the control group (23.0%) rather than in those with diarrhoea (8.9%). In the control group, CVLP were detected more frequently during the summer months. An inverse relationship between CVLP and rotavirus was observed in children. Adenovirus, astrovirus, calicivirus and SRV were detected in a small proportion of children with and without clinical symptoms of gastroenteritis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
