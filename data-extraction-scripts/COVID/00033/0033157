In the present study we have examined transcripts of various cytokines during acute and chronic stages of murine Tg encephalitis. In the brain of infected animals, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 mRNA were induced to a significant extent, but only low levels of IL-4 mRNA were detectable. A similar cytokine profile was observed in the spleen. However, in contrast to the brain, the increase of IL-2 mRNA was particularly pronounced in the spleen, whereas the opposite was found for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha mRNA. Thus, cytokines involved in T-cell proliferation were more prevalent in the spleen, but in the brain, where Tg actively multiplies, the effector molecules IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were preferentially up-regulated. In addition, a detailed analysis of cytokine mRNA levels in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-congenic strains of BALB and B10 mice revealed that the genetically regulated susceptibility to Tg was correlated with the amount of intracerebrally produced cytokine mRNA for IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-6. Mice with a strong increase of these cytokine mRNA were significantly better protected against Tg. This indicates that the outcome of toxoplasmosis may be critically dependent on an adequately regulated intracerebral immune response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
