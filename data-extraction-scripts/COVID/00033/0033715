<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1997-10-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Prevalence of coronavirus antibodies in Iowa swine.</TITLE><BODY>Three hundred and forty-seven serum samples from 22 Iowa swine herds were screened for TGEV/PRCV neutralizing antibody. Ninety-one percent of the sera and all 22 herds were positive. These sera were then tested by the blocking ELISA test to distinguish TGEV and PRCV antibody. The ELISA test confirmed the high percentage of TGEV/PRCV positive sera. By the blocking ELISA test, 12 herds were PRCV positive, 6 herds were TGEV positive and 4 herds were mixed with sera either positive for TGEV or PRCV antibody. The results suggest a recent increase in TGEV/PRCV seroprevalence in Iowa swine most likely due to subclinical PRCV infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
