<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1978-05-12</DATELINE><TITLE>RNA of mouse hepatitis virus.</TITLE><BODY>The RNA of mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus, was isolated from the virus released early in the infection and analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation and electrophoresis. It was found to consist of a piece of single-stranded RNA of about 60S. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 5.4 X 10(6) by electrophoresis in methylmercury-agarose gels. At least one third of the RNA contained polyadenylated sequences. It is, therefore, probably positive stranded. The virus harvested late in the infection contained, in addition to 60S, some 30 to 50S RNA that are possibly degradation products of the 60S RNA. No difference in the electrophoretic behavior could be detected between the RNA isolated from a pathogenic (JHM) and a nonpathogenic (A59) strain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
