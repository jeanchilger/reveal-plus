Although almost all A3/MHV cells were found infected, both A3/MHV and A3-1 cells expressed comparable levels of cell surface differentiation markers. In addition, A3/MHV cells retained the ability to form embryoid bodies. These results suggest that persistent coronavirus infection does not affect the differentiation of ES cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
