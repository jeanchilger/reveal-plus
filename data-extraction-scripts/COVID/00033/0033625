Fifty farms and 709 litters of piglets were included in the study. Oocysts were detected on 70% of farms, with 187 litters infected. A litter of pigs that was positive for oocysts was significantly more likely to exhibit diarrhea than a litter that was negative [odds ratio (OR) = 4.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.8 to 5.8; P < 0.001]. Management and housing factors were examined with respect to risk factors for the presence of I. suis. Farms that did not use a detergent when cleaning farrowing crates were 10-times more likely to be positive for I. suis than those that used a detergent (P = 0.007). It was concluded that coccidiosis is a common problem on Ontario swine farms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
