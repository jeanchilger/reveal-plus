The transcriptional patterns of the two viruses indicated that differences occurred in RNAs 1 and 2(S) and that RNA 3 was absent in the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) variant. The smaller RNA 2(S) of PRCV was due to a 681-nucleotide (nt) deletion after base 62 of the PRCV peplomer or spike (S) gene. The PRCV S gene still retained information for the 16-amino-acid signal peptide and the first 6 amino acid residues at the N terminus of the mature S protein, but the adjacent 227 residues were deleted. Two additional deletions (3 and 5 nt) were detected in the PRCV genome downstream of the S gene. The 3-nt deletion occurred in a noncoding region; however, the 5-nt deletion shortened the potential open reading frame A polypeptide from 72 to 53 amino acid residues. Significantly, a C-to-T substitution was detected in the last base position of the transcription recognition sequence upstream of open reading frame A, which rendered RNA 3 nondetectable in PRCV-infected cell cultures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
