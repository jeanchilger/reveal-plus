We have analyzed the structure of the 3' noncoding region of the viral genome by thermodynamic-based structure calculation and by chemical and enzymatic probing of in vitro-synthesized RNAs and provide evidence for the existence of an RNA pseudoknot structure in this region. To explore the functional significance of this structure, revertants of a mutant bearing a lesion in the proposed pseudoknot and exhibiting a temperature-sensitive defect in viral RNA synthesis were isolated and mapped. The results of this genetic analysis established a correlation between the structure of the 3' terminus of the viral RNA and its function in vivo in RNA amplification. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicated that a similar structure could be formed in coxsackievirus B1, a related enterovirus, which further supports a role for the pseudoknot structure in viral RNA amplification in infected cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
