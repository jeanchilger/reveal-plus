However, given the known interactions between 5S rRNA and ribosomal protein L5 (previously called L1 or YL3) encoded by an essential, single-copy gene, we monitored the effects of a series of well-defined rpl5 mutants on PRF and virus propagation. Consistent with the mof9 results, we find that the rpl5 mutants promoted increased frameshifting efficiencies in both the -1 and +1 directions, and conferred defects in the ability of cells to propagate two endogenous viruses. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that mutant ribosomes had decreased affinities for peptidyl-tRNA. Pharmacological studies showed that sparsomycin, a peptidyltransferase inhibitor that specifically increases the binding of peptidyl-tRNA with ribosomes, was antagonistic to the frameshifting defects of the most severe mutant, and the extent of sparsomycin resistance correlated with the severity of the frameshifting defects in all of the mutants. These results provide biochemical and physiological evidence that one function of L5 is to anchor peptidyl-tRNA to the P-site. A model is presented describing how decreased affinity of ribosomes for peptidyl-tRNA can affect both -1 and +1 frameshifting, and for the effects of sparsomycin.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
