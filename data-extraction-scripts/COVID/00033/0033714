The ORF must remain open throughout most of its sequence for replication to occur. To determine the qualitative importance of the N portion of the chimeric ORF in DI RNA replication, transcripts of mutated reporter-containing constructs were tested for replication in helper virus-infected cells. It was determined that the N ORF could not be replaced by the naturally occurring internal I protein ORF, accomplished by deleting the first base in the N start codon which leads to a +1 frameshift, nor could it be replaced by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ORF. Furthermore, 3'-terminal truncations of the N gene leaving less than 85% of its total length were likewise not tolerated. Small in-frame deletions and in-frame foreign sequence insertions of up to 99 nucleotides within certain regions of the N ORF were tolerated, however, but the rate of DI RNA accumulation in these cases was lower. These results indicate that there is a requirement for translation of most if not all of the N protein in cis for optimal replication of the bovine coronavirus DI RNA and suggest that a similar requirement may exist for viral genome replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
