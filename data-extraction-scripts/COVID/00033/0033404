<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006</DATELINE><TITLE>Progressive dyspnea associated with a crazy-paving appearance on a chest computed tomography scan</TITLE><BODY>A ‘crazy-paving’ appearance of the lungs on computed tomography scanning of the chest was first described nearly 20 years ago in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and was thought to be characteristic of this condition. However, this pattern has subsequently been reported in a variety of pulmonary diseases and is now considered to be nonspecific. The present report describes a case of a 74-year-old man in whom congestive heart failure presented with a crazy-paving appearance of the lungs on a chest computed tomography scan. This uncommon association illustrates the importance of the correlation of clinical and radiographic information.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
