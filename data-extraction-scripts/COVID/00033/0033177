Both viruses were greater than 99% inhibited by 0.1 mM inhibitor. Endpoint titrations showed that inhibiting activity paralleled that of leupeptin, a serine and cysteine protease inhibitor, and indicated that 1 to 2 microM inhibitor, slightly above physiologic levels, was effective.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
