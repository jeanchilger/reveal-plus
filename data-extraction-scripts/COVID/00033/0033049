Usual regulatory mechanisms cannot shepherd research protocols with benefits that can only be characterized as “uncertain” in the face of more than minimal risk. When a protocol is placed in a government forum for analysis, the public has a unique opportunity to debate the balancing of research risks and benefits on behalf of children who are unable to assent to research themselves, as well as to express views about vaccination policy broadly. This model for review of pediatric research that may be without benefit will be especially important as challenging studies of various vaccines against a range of infectious properties, such as anthrax and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), emerge.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
