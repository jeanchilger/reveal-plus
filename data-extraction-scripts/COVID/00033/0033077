The internal region is important for positive-strand DI RNA synthesis (Y. N. Kim and S. Makino, J. Virol. 69:4963–4971, 1995). We further characterized the 58-nt region in the present study and obtained the following results. (i) The positive-strand RNA structure in solution was comparable with that predicted by computer modeling. (ii) Positive-strand RNA secondary structure, but not negative-strand RNA structure, was important for the biological function of the region. (iii) The biological function had a sequence-specific requirement. We discuss possible mechanisms by which the internal cis-acting signal drives MHV positive-strand DI RNA synthesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
