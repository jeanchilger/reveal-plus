<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1994-11-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Evidence for a putative second receptor for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus on the villous enterocytes of newborn pigs.</TITLE><BODY>Aminopeptidase-N (APN) has been identified [B. Delmas, J. Gelfi, R. L'Haridon, L. K. Vogel, H. Sjostrom, O. Noren, and H. Laude, Nature (London) 357:417-420, 1992] as a major receptor for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Binding of TGEV to villous enterocytes from the jejuna of newborn pigs is saturable and at a higher level than that of binding of virus to newborn cryptal enterocytes or to enterocytes from older piglets (H. M. Weingartl and J. B. Derbyshire, Vet. Microbiol. 35:23-32, 1993). The distribution of APN in enterocytes in the jejuna of neonatal and 3 week-old-piglets, as determined by the measurement of enzymatic activity and by labeling of the cells with an anti-APN monoclonal antibody, did not correspond with the reported distribution of saturable binding sites on enterocytes. Monoclonal antibodies, which were prepared against plasma membranes derived from enterocytes harvested from the upper villi of newborn pigs, blocked the replication of TGEV, but not the porcine respiratory coronavirus, in ST cells and immunoprecipitated a 200-kDa protein in ST cell lysates. This protein was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and by fluorescence-activated cell scanning to be present on the villous enterocytes of newborn pigs but to be lacking on the cryptal enterocytes of newborn pigs and on the villous and cryptal enterocytes of 3-week-old piglets. Since this distribution of the protein corresponds to the previously demonstrated distribution of saturable binding sites, we conclude that the 200-kDa protein may be an additional receptor for TGEV which is restricted to the villous enterocytes of newborn pigs and which contributes to the age sensitivity of these animals to the virus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
