By employing the polymerase chain reaction, we learned that the 5'-terminal 5 nt on the common leader sequence of bovine coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs were heterogeneous and hypervariable throughout early infection in cell culture and that as a persistent infection became established, termini giving rise to a common 33-nt intraleader open reading frame were selected. Since the common leader is derived from the genomic 5' end during transcription, a common focus of origin for the heterogeneity is expected. The intraleader open reading frame was shown by in vitro translation studies to attenuate translation of downstream open reading frames in a cloned bovine coronavirus mRNA molecule. Selection of an intraleader open reading frame resulting in a general attenuation of mRNA translation and a consequent attenuation of virus replication may, therefore, be a mechanism by which coronaviruses and possibly other RNA viruses with a similar transcriptional strategy maintain a persistent infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
