Here we show that the envelope glycoprotein from the Zaire strain of Ebola virus (Ebo-GP) is proteolytically processed into two subunits, GP(1) and GP(2), that are likely covalently associated through a disulfide linkage. Murine leukemia virions pseudotyped with Ebo-GP contain almost exclusively processed glycoprotein, indicating that this is the mature form of Ebo-GP. Mutational analysis identified a dibasic motif, reminiscent of furin-like protease processing sites, as the Ebo-GP cleavage site. However, analysis of Ebo-GP processing in LoVo cells that lack the proprotein convertase furin demonstrated that furin is not required for processing of Ebo-GP. In sharp contrast to other viral systems, we found that an uncleaved mutant of Ebo-GP was able to mediate infection of various cell lines as efficiently as the wild-type, proteolytically cleaved glycoprotein, indicating that cleavage is not required for the activation of Ebo-GP despite the conservation of a dibasic cleavage site in all filoviral envelope glycoproteins.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
