Boophilus microplus infestation caused a marginal decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes in PBL, which was observed in both lightly (5000 larvae) and heavily (40 000 larvae) infested cattle, and began at the second infestation and continued until the end of the fourth infestation. The percentage of B lymphocytes in heavily tick-infested cattle was less than that in non-infested control cattle after the fourth infestation. The response of PBL from tick-infested cattle to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was always less than that of tick-free cattle after the second infestation. No noteworthy differences were detected between the three stages of tick infestation, that is, 1 week before the peak of adult engorgement, the middle of the peak and 1 week after all ticks had dropped. Boophilus microplus saliva (100 μl ml−1) suppressed 47% of the response of bovine PBL to PHA in vitro. This suppressive effect of saliva may contribute to the lowerresponsiveness of PBL from tick-infested cattle. Antibody production by tick-infested cattle was examined during the third and fourth heavy tick infestation. Tick-infested cattle showed a diminished response against ovalbumin after the second immunization. The immunosuppressive effects of tick infestation may play an important role in tick survival or in the transmission of tick-borne diseases in the field.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
