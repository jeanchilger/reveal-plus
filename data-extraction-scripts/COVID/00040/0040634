In BALB/c endothelial cells, up to 16-fold more IL-6 (> 640 U/ml) was induced, compared to SJL cells which showed a minimal response (40 U/ml), relative to basal levels (< 20 U/ml). In contrast, both BALB/c and SJL astrocytes showed a substantial IL-6 response to MHV-4 and UV-MHV-4 exposure, although a strain difference persisted. Despite strain and cell specific differences in released IL-6, equivalent levels of IL-6 mRNA were induced in all cell types following exposure to MHV-4 or UV-MHV-4.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
