<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-11-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Regional Infectious Disease Surveillance Networks and their Potential to Facilitate the Implementation of the International Health Regulations</TITLE><BODY>The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 present a challenge and opportunity for global surveillance and control of infectious diseases.

Two regional infectious disease surveillance networks, established in the Mekong Basin and the Middle East, are presented as case studies. The public-private partnerships in the networks have led to an upgrade in infectious disease surveillance systems in capacity building, purchasing technology equipment, sharing of information, and development of preparedness plans in combating avian influenza. These regional networks have become an appropriate infrastructure for the implementation of the IHR 2005.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
