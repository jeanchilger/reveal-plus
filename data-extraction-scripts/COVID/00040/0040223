The chapter tests the sensitivity and the selectivity of the SARS genosensor using complementary strands of SARS virus and three-base mismatch strands. Genosensor construction include following steps: a drop of 5 mL of 1.02 mM thiolated probe deposited on the gold film and maintain at 37°C for 20 min or at 41°C for 12 h; it is cleaned with 0.1M Tris-HCl buffer; further a15 mL drop of a 2% 1-hexanethiol solution is deposited on the gold film and maintained for 10 min and again cleaned with a 2×SSC buffer solution pH 7. From the results of hybridization assay and recording of the analytical signal no significant difference found between the analytical signal obtained for a 3.03nM solution of the complementary target strand and three-base mismatch strand. The limit of detection, calculated as the concentration corresponding to a signal which is three times the standard deviation of the intercept, results to be 5 pM. This means an improvement of various orders of magnitude when compared with limits of detection reported in the bibliography for DNA assays.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
