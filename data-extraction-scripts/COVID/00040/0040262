Streamline 25 column (ID = 25 mm) was used as a contactor and Streamline chelating adsorbent immobilized with Ni(2+) ion was used as affinity adsorbent. The dynamic binding capacity of Ni(2+)-loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent for the NP protein in unclarified feedstock was found to be 2.94 mg ml(−1) adsorbent at a superficial velocity of 200 cm h(−1). The direct purification of NP protein from unclarified feedstock using expanded bed adsorption has resulted in a 31% adsorption and 9.6% recovery of NP protein. The purity of the NP protein recovered was about 70% and the volume of processing fluid was reduced by a factor of 10. The results of the present study show that the IMA-EBAC developed could be used to combine the clarification, concentration and initial purification steps into a single-step operation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
