<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-03-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Modification of textile surfaces using nanoparticles</TITLE><BODY>The application of nanotechnology on textile materials could lead to the addition of several functional properties to the base substrate. Those functional properties are of the highest importance, giving noticeable improvements in the wear comfort and care. This chapter discusses various functional properties – for example, anti-microbial, easy-care, ultraviolet-protecting and flame-retardant finishes that could be achieved by the application of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. In addition, novel applications of textile materials using nanotechnology in biological detection, decomposition of toxic gases, self-decontamination and military protection gear are discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
