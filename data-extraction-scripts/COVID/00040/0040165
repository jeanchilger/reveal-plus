<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-03-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Antibacterial bioactive materials</TITLE><BODY>Bioactive materials with antibacterial properties have significant medical interest. Antibacterial bioactive materials can be prepared by simple combination of antibacterial substances with materials such as hydrogels, ceramics, metals, and polymers, in different forms, such as fibres, foams, films or gels. The delivery of the antibacterial molecules will lead to the killing of bacteria. Another approach is to design the material itself to possess the antibacterial properties, especially at the surface of the material. The applications have been found in orthopaedics and cardiovascular grafts, as a means of reducing the incidence of infection. In the wound care industry, using antibacterial bioactive materials to control infection is always the first line for wound treatment. However, there are still considerable limitations, including the difficulty in treatment of the infection at depth, the control of the biofilm formation, and the development of generic and specific antibacterial bioactive materials. In future, bioactive materials based on biomimetic materials with antibacterial properties will be developed from natural resources to minimize the negative impact on the human body.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
