Animals were monitored for proviral DNA by FIV-specific PCR and for FIV-specific antibody profiles by ELISA and virus-neutralization assays. In addition, blood from challenged cats was inoculated into naive SPF cats to confirm the viral status of the vaccinated cats. All cats immunized with Petaluma vaccine alone were protected against homologous Petaluma challenge, but only one of four cats was protected against heterologous Shizuoka challenge. More importantly, all cats immunized with the dual-subtype vaccine were protected against both Petaluma and Shizuoka challenges. These results suggest that a multi-subtype vaccine approach may provide the broad-spectrum immunity necessary for vaccine protection against strains from different subtypes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
