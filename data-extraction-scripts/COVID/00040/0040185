A series of ORF1 mutants of HEV-SAR55 replicon were constructed and tested for viability in S10-3 cells. Six of PCP-‘cysteine’ (C457A, C459A, C471A, C472A, C481A and C483A) and three ‘histidine’ (H443L, H497L and H590L) mutants were lethal. Further, a highly conserved ‘glycine-triad’ (G815-G816-G817) in downstream X-domain, homologous to rubella virus protease-substrate (G1299-G1300-G1301) was identified where two of X-mutants (G816V and G817V) turned lethal. However, all ORF1 sequential nucleotide-mutants conserving the amino acids were viable, which clearly showed post-translational regulation of HEV replication by PCP- and X-domains. Moreover, while vector-expressed ORF1-fusion polyprotein yielded a ∼191kDa band in vitro, it produced ∼78 and ∼35kDa fragments ex vivo. Collectively, the indispensability and functional effects of ‘PCP-catalytic’ and ‘X-substrate’ residues on HEV replication strongly supported a viral protease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
