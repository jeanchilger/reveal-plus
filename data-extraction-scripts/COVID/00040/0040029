However, the diagnosis of human coronavirus infections is not carried out routinely, primarily because the isolation and propagation of these viruses in tissue culture is difficult and time consuming. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of recombinant, bacterial expressed proteins in the serodiagnosis of coronavirus infections. Two proteins were examined: the human coronavirus 229E nucleocapsid protein (N), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pUR and the coronavirus 229E surface glycoprotein (S), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pROS. The recombinant proteins were used as antigens in Western blot (WB) assays to detect the 229E-specific IgG antibodies and the results were compared with a standard serological method, indirect immunofluorescence. Serum samples of 51 paediatric patients, suffering from acute respiratory illness, and 10 adults, voluntarily infected with human coronavirus, were tested. The serum samples of the adult group had coronavirus-specific IgG antibodies in both test systems. In contrast, only 8 51 sera of the paediatric group were positive for coronavirus-specific IgG by both WB and IF and 20 51 sera were positive by WB, but not by IF. The overall incidence of human coronavirus infections in the paediatric age group was 55% evaluated by WB analysis and 16% evaluated by IF. This study shows that recombinant human coronavirus 229E proteins are suitable reagents for the epidemiological screening of coronavirus 229E infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
