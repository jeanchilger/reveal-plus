<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>3 China</TITLE><BODY>Abstract This chapter examines e-government in greater China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan. It opens with a survey of how the People's Republic has deployed the internet as part of a transition into a globalized capitalist economy. Although the state has enjoyed some successes such as telemedicine, much e-government is designed to legitimate and enhance the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party, and/or to improve economic efficiency. China has a rich array of municipal e-government programs, led by Shanghai and Beijing. The chapter notes China's severe internet censorship. In contrast, Hong Kong and Taiwan provide sophisticated e-government models that promote citizen participation and enhance the daily quality of life.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
