The PPIase activity of most Cyps is inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A and several of its non-immunosuppressive analogs, which can also block the replication of nidoviruses (arteriviruses and coronaviruses). Cyclophilins have been reported to play an essential role in the replication of several other RNA viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus-1, hepatitis C virus, and influenza A virus. Likewise, the replication of various nidoviruses was reported to depend on Cyps or other PPIases. This review summarizes our current understanding of this class of nidovirus-host interactions, including the potential function of in particular CypA and the inhibitory effect of Cyp inhibitors. Also the involvement of the FK-506-binding proteins and parvulins is discussed. The nidovirus data are placed in a broader perspective by summarizing the most relevant data on Cyp interactions and Cyp inhibitors for other RNA viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
