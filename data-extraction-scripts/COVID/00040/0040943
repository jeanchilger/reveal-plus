It was found that: (1) there was an overall increase in knowledge of bioevent preparedness; (2) participants gave high ratings for the effectiveness of the PBL process; (3) participants found value in the multidisciplinary group process; and (4) participants strongly agreed that they preferred the PBL process to the traditional lecture format for learning about bioevent preparedness. The PBL approach is useful in educating community-based health professionals from different disciplines about issues related to pandemic preparedness.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
