Each of the 10 dsRNA genome segments of ObRV was sequenced and shown to contain a single open reading frame (ORF). Conserved motifs ([+ve] 5′-AAATAAA … G/TAGGTT-3′) were found at the termini of each segment, with the exception of Seg-6 and Seg-8, where the 5′ termini were 5′-AACAAA…-3′. The putative proteins encoded by each segment were compared with those of other members of the family Reoviridae. Phylogenetic comparisons to published sequences for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes from other reoviruses indicated that ObRV is most closely related to members of the genus Cypovirus. However, unlike the cypoviruses, ObRV has a double-layered capsid structure. When the protein encoded by ObRV Seg-10 was expressed (by inserting the open reading frame into a baculovirus expression vector) no ‘occlusion bodies’ were observed in the recombinant baculovirus infected insect cell cultures. This suggests that unlike the cypoviruses, Seg-10 of ObRV does not contain a polyhedrin gene. Further phylogenetic comparisons also identified relationships between Seg-2 and Seg-10 of ObRV, and genes of Diadromus pulchellus Idnoreovirus 1 (DpIRV1), suggesting that ObRV represents a new species from the genus Idnoreovirus.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
