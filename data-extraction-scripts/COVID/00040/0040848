Although comprised of several phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets, the differentiation of specialized Treg cell populations within the periphery is poorly characterized. We demonstrate that the development of T-bet(+) Treg cells that potently inhibit T helper (Th)1 cell responses was dependent on the transcription factor STAT1, and occurred directly in response to interferon-γ produced by effector T cells. Additionally, delayed induction of the IL-12Rβ2 receptor component following STAT1 activation helped ensure that Treg cells do not readily complete STAT4-dependent Th1 cell development and lose their ability to suppress effector T cell proliferation. Thus, we define a pathway of abortive Th1 cell development that results in the specialization of peripheral Treg cells, and demonstrate that impaired expression of a single cytokine receptor helps maintain Treg cell suppressive function in the context of inflammatory Th1 cell responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
