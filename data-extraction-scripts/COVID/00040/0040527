The median lethal concentration (96 h) of CQ was 31.62 mg/ml. During acute treatment (CQ at 31.62 mg/ml) the treated fish groups showed a significant increase in GOT and GPT activities in blood plasma; whereas LDH activity was decreased when compare to control groups. To analyse the effects of drug at the lowest concentration, the fish were exposed to 3.16 mg/ml (1/10th of 96 h LC50 value) for 96 h. In sublethal treatment (3.16 mg/ml) GOT activity increased up to 14th day and decreased during the rest of the exposure period (21, 28 and 35th day). A biphasic response in GPT activity was observed. LDH activity was found to be increased throughout the study period (35 days) compare to control groups. The alterations in enzyme activities in blood plasma were found to be significant at p < 0.05 (DMRT). Many histopathological changes in vital organs such as gill, liver and kidney of fish were observed in CQ treated group (acute and sub-lethal) compare to normal group. The alterations in the enzymological and histopathological study in the present investigation indicate that the drug CQ has toxic effects on non-target organisms. We conclude that the alterations in enzymological parameters and histopathological changes can be used as biomarker to assess the health of the aquatic organism/environment. Further data on molecular studies are needed to define the mode of action and toxicity of these emerging pollutants.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
