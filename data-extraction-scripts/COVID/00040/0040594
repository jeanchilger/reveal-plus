To better simulate natural infection in vitro, we adapted a system that generates viral aerosols similar to those exhaled by infected humans to the inoculation of epithelial cell monolayers. Procedures for cellular infection and calculation of exposure dose were developed and tested using viruses characterized by distinct transmission and pathogenicity phenotypes: an HPAI H5N1, an LPAI H7N9, and a seasonal H3N2 virus. While all three aerosolized viruses were highly infectious in a bronchial epithelial cell line (Calu-3) cultured submerged in media, differences between the viruses were observed in primary human alveolar epithelial cells and in Calu-3 cells cultured at air-liquid interface. This system provides a novel enhancement to traditional in vitro experiments, particularly those focused on the early stages of infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
