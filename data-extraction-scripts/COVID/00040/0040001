Objective We assessed which inflammatory mediators were released from bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) after infection with rhinovirus and then determined whether they were also present in subjects with acute virus-induced asthma, with the aim to identify a biomarker or biomarkers for acute virus-induced asthma. Methods BECs were obtained from bronchial brushings of steroid-naive asthmatic subjects and healthy nonatopic control subjects. Cells were infected with rhinovirus 16. Inflammatory mediators were measured by means of flow cytometry with a cytometric bead array. Subjects with acute asthma and virus infection were recruited; they were characterized clinically by using lung function tests and had blood taken to measure the inflammatory mediators identified as important by the BEC experiments. Results IFN-γ–induced protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES were released in the greatest quantities, followed by IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. Dexamethasone treatment of BECs only partially suppressed IP-10 and TNF-α but was more effective at suppressing RANTES, IL-6, and IL-8. In acute clinical asthma serum IP-10 levels were increased to a greater extent in those with acute virus-induced asthma (median of 604 pg/mL compared with 167 pg/mL in those with non–virus-induced acute asthma, P < .01). Increased serum IP-10 levels were predictive of virus-induced asthma (odds ratio, 44.3 [95% CI, 3.9-100.3]). Increased serum IP-10 levels were strongly associated with more severe airflow obstruction (r = −0.8; P < .01). Conclusions IP-10 release is specific to acute virus-induced asthma. Clinical implications Measurement of serum IP-10 could be used to predict a viral trigger to acute asthma.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
