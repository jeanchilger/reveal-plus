We found for the first time that the mature SARS 3CL protease is subject to degradation at 188Arg/189Gln. Replacing Arg with Ile at position 188 rendered the protease resistant to proteolysis. The R188I mutant digested a conserved undecapeptide substrate with a K m of 33.8μM and k cat of 4753s−1. Compared with the value reported for the mature protease containing a C-terminal His-tag, the relative activity of the mutant was nearly 106. Novel peptide-aldehyde derivatives containing a side-chain-protected C-terminal Gln efficiently inhibited the catalytic activity of the R188I mutant. The results indicated for the first time that the tetrapeptide sequence is enough for inhibitory activities of peptide-aldehyde derivatives.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
