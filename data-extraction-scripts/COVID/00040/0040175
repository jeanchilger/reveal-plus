This study was aimed to determine whether hyposialylated fAGP influences phagocytosis. A flow cytometric method based on ingestion of fluoresceinated bacteria and adapted to feline blood was used to assess phagocytosis of leukocytes incubated with ‘non-pathological’ fAGP (purified from sera with normal concentrations of AGP) and ‘pathological’ fAGP (purified from sera with >1.5 mg/mL hyposialylated AGP). The flow cytometric method provided repeatable results for neutrophils (coefficients of variations, CVs <15%) but not for monocytes (CVs > 20%) which had also a high individual variability. Compared with saline solution and with non-pathological fAGP, pathological fAGP significantly decreased phagocytosis in neutrophils and monocytes. This study demonstrated that hyposialylated fAGP down-regulates the phagocytic activity of feline neutrophils.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
