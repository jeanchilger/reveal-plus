Although chest radiograph and computed tomography are the commonly used diagnostic tools for the early diagnosis of lung manifestations of infections, they lack the specificity for the wide range of chest infections which can occur in immunocompromised patients. Systematic analysis of the imaging findings in correlation with the clinical settings along with comparison with the old images can expedite early and accurate diagnosis for subsequent appropriate management. Computer tomography findings in immunocompromised patients with respiratory infections, with regards to various clinical settings, will be discussed here.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
