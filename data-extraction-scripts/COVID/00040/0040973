Once found on three continents, this streamline carnivore is disappearing rapidly from its former range and faces a bleak future due to numerous factors, including, popularity by nobility as pets and hunting companions, human population growth, human-wildlife conflict, illegal trafficking, loss of genetic diversity, and many others. The conservation crisis this species is facing is overwhelming, yet a core of hard-working conservationists has been working diligently for decades to slow, and in some areas try to even reverse, their downward spiral. This narrative will give the reader an insight into the history of the conservation efforts for this species, what has been done to date, and what still needs to be developed to save this unique species.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
