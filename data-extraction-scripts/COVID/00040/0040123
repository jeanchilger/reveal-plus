This article reports selected results from an investigation of the health implications of commitments made at the 1999, 2000 and 2001 Summits of the G7/G8, with special reference to the developing world. We emphasize commitments that relate to the socioeconomic determinants of health (primarily to reducing poverty and economic insecurity) and to the ability of national governments to make necessary basic investments in health systems, education and nutrition. We conclude that without a stronger commitment to redistributive policy measures on the part of the G7/G8, historic commitments on the part of the international community to providing health for all are likely not to be fulfilled.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
