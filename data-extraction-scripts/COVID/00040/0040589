Inactivated influenza vaccines are ineffective in infants under six months and to provide protection in older children generally require two doses given a month apart. This leaves few options for rapid protection of infants, e.g. during an influenza pandemic. We investigated whether Advax™, a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles could help overcome neonatal immune hypo-responsiveness and also whether it was possible to obtain single-dose influenza vaccine protection of babies against lethal infection. Inactivated influenza A/H1N1 vaccine (iH1N1) combined with Advax™ adjuvant administered as a single immunization to 7-day-old mouse pups significantly enhanced serum influenza-specific IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b levels in association with a 3–4 fold increase in the frequency of splenic influenza-specific IgM and IgG antibody secreting cells versus pups immunized with iH1N1 alone. Pups immunized with Advax-adjuvanted iH1N1 had significantly higher influenza-stimulated splenocyte production of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 and a 3–10 fold higher frequency of T cells IFN-γ secreting IL-2, IL-4 or IL-17 by ELISPOT. Immunisation with iH1N1+Advax adjuvant induced robust protection against influenza virus challenge 3 weeks post-immunization, whereas pups immunized with iH1N1 alone had no protection. Protection by Advax-adjuvanted iH1N1 was mediated by serum antibody and memory B cells rather than memory T cells as protection was lost in neonatal µMT mice that are B-cell deficient. Hence, Advax adjuvant overcame neonatal immune hypo-responsiveness and enabled single-dose protection of pups against otherwise lethal influenza infection, thereby supporting development of Advax™ as a neonatal vaccine adjuvant.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
