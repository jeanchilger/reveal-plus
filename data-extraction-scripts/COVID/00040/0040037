Current therapeutic treatments for Lassa fever are limited, making the development of novel countermeasures an urgent priority. In this study, we identified losmapimod, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, from 102 screened compounds as an inhibitor of LASV infection. Losmapimod exerted its inhibitory effect against LASV after p38 MAPK down-regulation, and, interestingly, had no effect on other arenaviruses capable of causing viral hemorrhagic fever. Mechanistic studies showed that losmapimod inhibited LASV entry by affecting the stable signal peptide (SSP)-GP2 subunit interface of the LASV glycoprotein, thereby blocking pH-dependent viral fusion. As an aryl heteroaryl bis-carboxyamide derivative, losmapimod represents a novel chemical scaffold with anti-LASV activity, and it provides a new lead structure for the future development of LASV fusion inhibitors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
