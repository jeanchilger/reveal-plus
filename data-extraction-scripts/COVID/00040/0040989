Their precursors, 3-fluoro-6-thio-glucopyranosyl nucleosides 5a-e, were obtained by the sequence of deacetylation of 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-β-d-glucopyranosyl nucleosides 2a-e, selective tosylation of the primary OH of 3 and finally treatment with potassium thioacetate. The desired thiolpyridine protected analogs 7a-c,f,g were obtained by the sequence of deacetylation of 5a-c followed by thiopyridinylation and/or condensation of the corresponding heterocyclic bases with the newly synthesized peracetylated 6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) sugar precursor 13, which was obtained via a novel synthetic route from glycosyl donor 12. None of the compounds 6 and 7 showed antiviral activity, but the 5-fluorouracil derivative 7c and particularly the uracil derivative 7b were endowed with an interesting and selective cytostatic action against a variety of murine and human tumor cell cultures.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
