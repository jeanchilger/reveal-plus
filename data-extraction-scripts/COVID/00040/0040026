This is true for virtually every aspect of a virus' replication cycle from virus entry to the budding or release of progeny virus particles. In this chapter, we will discuss new information on the impacts of virus-mediated manipulation of Dynein motor complexes and associated machineries and factors. We will highlight how these host cell components impact on pathogenicity and immune responses, as many of the virus-mediated hijacked components also play pivotal roles in immune responses to pathogen insult. There are several comprehensive reviews that define virus–Dynein interactions including the first edition of this book that describes how viruses manipulate the host cell machineries their advantage. An updated table is included to summarize these virus–host interactions. Notably, barriers to intracellular translocation represent major hurdles to viral components during de novo infection and during active replication and the generation of progeny virus particles. Clearly, the subversion of host cell molecular motor protein activities takes advantage of constitutive and regulated membrane trafficking events and will target virus components to intracytoplasmic locales and membrane assembly. Broadening our understanding of the interplay between viruses, Dynein and the cytoskeleton will likely inform on new types of therapies. Continual enhancement of the breadth of new information on how viruses manipulate host cell biology will inevitably aid in the identification of new targets that can be poisoned to block old, new, and emerging viruses alike in their tracks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
