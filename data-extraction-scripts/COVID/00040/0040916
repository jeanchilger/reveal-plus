The status of 79 dairy herds located in two Northern and two Southern Regions of Sweden were surveyed by measuring antibody concentrations to BCV and BRSV in pooled milk samples from primiparous cows, and in bulk-tank milk twice annually. In the Southern Regions the percentage of antibody-positive herds remained persistently high (75–100%), whereas in herds based in the Northern Region, the percentage of positive herds for BCV and BRSV was 38–80% and 0–80%, respectively, with antibody levels to BRSV decreasing over time. Pooled milk samples of ‘home-bred’ primiparous animals were found to be most useful in terms of monitoring herd status but could gradually be replaced by bulk-tank sampling once freedom from infection was established.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
