<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-04-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Rescue of chimeric adenoviral vectors to expand the serotype repertoire</TITLE><BODY>The successful use of any adenoviral vectors is predicated upon the use of a serotype that is not neutralized by circulating antibodies. However, efforts to develop a diverse repertoire of serologically distinct adenovirus vectors may be hindered by the necessity to generate cell lines to allow for the successful propagation of vectors deleted of essential genes. A strategy to construct chimeric adenoviruses whereby the rescue and propagation of an E1 deleted HAdV-B – derived adenoviral vector can be achieved using existing cell lines such as HEK 293 is reported. It is further shown that this strategy may be more widely applicable.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
