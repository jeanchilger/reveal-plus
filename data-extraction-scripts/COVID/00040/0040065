The disease quickly spread to countries around the world and was transmitted in healthcare settings. Infection control professionals had to formulate a response to potential cases of SARS presenting to healthcare facilities. OBJECTIVE: To formulate and operationalize a plan for education and training of staff and to ensure availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and adherence to infection control protocols to prevent SARS transmission in a large urban healthcare institution. METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force was charged with maintaining up-to-date knowledge about the SARS epidemic and providing education and training to staff in the hospital and outlying clinics. Signage for SARS triage and SARS isolation was created. Policies and checklists were developed for designated patient areas, and SARS carts and boxes stocked with PPE were obtained for these areas. A new “observer” role was created to ensure adherence to isolation procedures when caring for SARS patients. An educational video was made for distribution to healthcare workers. RESULTS: The SARS task force developed a cohesive package of policies, procedures, signage, and patient education in multiple languages. We developed a system to supply PPE and education to staff who might care for SARS patients. A new video will make staff education more accessible, especially for those working off-site or during nontraditional hours. CONCLUSION: The SARS task force responded to an emerging infectious threat and is a model for continued response to potential biological emergencies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
