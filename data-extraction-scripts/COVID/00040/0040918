Despite high infectivity of the virus and lack of long-term immunity, volunteer and authentic studies has suggested the existence of inherited protective factors. Recent studies have shown that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and in particular secretor status controlled by the α1,2fucosyltransferase FUT2 gene determine susceptibility to norovirus infections, with nonsecretors (FUT2−/−), representing 20% of Europeans, being highly resistant to symptomatic infections with major strains of norovirus. Moreover, the capsid protein from distinct strains shows different HBGA specificities, suggesting a host–pathogen co-evolution driven by carbohydrate–protein interactions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
