A 230-bp segment of the gene encoding for transmembrane protein M of CCV is the target sequence of the primer. The test described in the present study was able to amplify both CCV and TGEV strains and also gave positive results on fecal samples from CCV infected dogs. n-PCR has a sensitivity as high as isolation on cell cultures, and can therefore be used for the diagnosis of CCV infection in dogs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
