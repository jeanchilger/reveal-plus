Grossly, there were patchy or diffuse areas of endocardial thickening affecting the left ventricle. The more common patchy endocardial lesions occurred as large trabecular or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum. Microscopically, regardless of the gross pattern, the thickened endocardium contained various numbers of stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells surrounded by fibrous connective tissue. Immunohistochemical findings were indicative of smooth muscle differentiation in mesenchymal cells. These cells proliferated vigorously and produced alcian blue-positive ground substance and collagen fibres; it was considered that the mesenchymal cells contributed to the formation of the endocardial lesions. In addition, multiple left ventricular ‘false tendons’ were invariably included within the trabecular or broad fibrous bands, providing a framework for formation of those bands. Evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis was lacking in all 41 cases, and no viral genomes were detected in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 of the hearts. These observations suggest that any relationship between feline RCM and a virus-induced inflammatory response seems unlikely.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
