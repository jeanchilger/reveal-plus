<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1996-12-01</DATELINE><TITLE>PHARYNGITIS</TITLE><BODY>Pharyngitis encompasses infection or irritation of the pharynx and tonsils. Rarely found in infants younger than 1 year and uncommon in infants younger than 2 years, the illness peaks between ages 4 to 7 years but recurs throughout life, especially whenever people congregate and in the winter months. 9 Viral agents are the usual culprits. 7,21 Although group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) causes only 15% of all pharyngitis, it is the usual bacterial cause and may cause significant nonsuppurative sequelae in the form of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) or acute glomerulonephritis (AGN). All types of pharyngitis can lead to suppurative complications including cervical lymphadenitis, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, sinusitis, and otitis media.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
