The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of pure trans- and cis-5-azidoisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonates with selected alkynes gave the respective nucleoside mimetics containing a 1,2,3-triazole linker. The (1,2,3-triazolyl)isoxazolidine phosphonates obtained herein were evaluated in vitro for activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. None of the compounds were endowed with antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations. Compounds 15f–j and 16f–j were cytostatic in the higher micromolar range.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
