<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-04-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Disaster Preparedness and Response for the Burn Mass Casualty Incident in the Twenty-first Century</TITLE><BODY>The effective and efficient coordination of emergent patient care at the point of injury followed by the systematic resource-based triage of casualties are the most critical factors that influence patient outcomes after mass casualty incidents (MCIs). The effectiveness and appropriateness of implemented actions are largely determined by the extent and efficacy of the planning and preparation that occur before the MCI. The goal of this work was to define the essential efforts related to planning, preparation, and execution of acute and subacute medical care for disaster burn casualties. This type of MCI is frequently referred to as a burn MCI.”&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
