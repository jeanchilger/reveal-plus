Sulfite 4 worked as a practical monomer for the preparation of (1 → 2)-linked polysaccharide skeletons. The chemical stability of 4 was evaluated by the comparison of thermodynamic parameters with those of conventional epoxide (2). The grafting reaction of 4 from glycyrrhetic acid (5) was performed in the presence of TfOH and MS 3A in CH(2)Cl(2) at room temperature. The polymerization degree was moderately controllable by the change of feed ratio of initiator.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
