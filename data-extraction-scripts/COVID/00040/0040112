Current synthetic DNA delivery systems are versatile and safe, but substantially less efficient than viruses. Here, a novel multicomponent supramolecular system involving the preparation of mannose-bearing chitosan oligomers microspheres with entrapping complexes of DNA vaccine and polyethylenimine was developed to mimic many of the beneficial properties of the viruses. After delivery by intramuscular immunization in BALB/c mice, the microspheres induced an enhanced serum antibody responses two orders of magnitude greater than naked DNA vaccine. Additionally, in contrast to naked DNA, the microspheres induced potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses at a low dose. Consequently, formulation of DNA vaccines into multicomponent vectors is a powerful means of increasing vaccine potency.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
