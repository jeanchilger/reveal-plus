The mechanisms by which viruses promote these superinfections are diverse and replete. Whereas we understand much as to how viruses damage the airway and dysregulate both innate and acquired immune responses which, in turn, supports bacterial growth, adherence and invasion into normally sterile sites within the respiratory tract, new information regarding these co-infections is being gained from recent advances in microbiome research and our enhanced appreciation of the contribution of bacterial biofilms, among others. The advanced understanding obtained by continued research efforts in all aspects of viral–bacterial co-infections of the respiratory tract will allow us to devise novel approaches for disease prevention as well as to develop more effective therapeutics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
