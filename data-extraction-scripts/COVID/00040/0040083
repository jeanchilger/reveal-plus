From January 2001 to June 2006 the clinical characteristics and outcome of 177 consecutive patients with MRSA bacteraemia visiting an ED of a university hospital were studied. The average age of the patients was 65.8 years. Healthcare-associated MRSA bacteraemia comprised 76.3% of all cases. Catheter-related bacteraemia was the most common type of infection (22.6%), followed by soft tissue infection (20.9%) and primary bacteraemia (15.3%). Different types of infection were significantly related to different outcome. In-hospital mortality was 33.3%, but the mortality decreased to 17.7% when patients with rapidly fatal disease and mortality within 3 days were excluded. All isolates exhibited lower susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 1–2μg/mL). Factors associated with mortality included severity of underlying illness, severity of bacteraemia and persistent bacteraemia. A detrimental effect of elevated MIC could not be demonstrated despite applying several definitions of patient outcome. Patients admitted to the ED with MRSA bacteraemia carry high overall mortality; however, the severity of underlying illness, severity of bacteraemia and persistent bacteraemia are correlated with mortality, but not vancomycin MICs (2μg/mL) of MRSA isolates.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
