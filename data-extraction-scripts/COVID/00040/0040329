A carbon-fiber ionizer was installed upstream of a medium-efficiency air filter to generate air ions, which were used to charge the virus aerosols and increase their filtration efficiency. After the virus aerosols were captured by the filter for a certain time interval, they were exposed to a newly incoming air ion flow. Captured virus particles were detached from the filter by sonication, and their antiviral efficiency due to air ions was calculated by counting the plaque-forming units. The antiviral efficiency increased with ion exposure time and ion concentration. When the concentration of positive air ions was 107 ions/cm3, the antiviral efficiencies were 46.1, 78.8, and 83.7% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45min, respectively. When the ionizer was operated in a bipolar mode, the number concentrations of positive and negative ions were 6.6×106 and 3.4×106 ions/cm3, respectively, and the antiviral efficiencies were 64.3, 89.1, and 97.4% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45min, respectively. As a quantitative parameter for the performance evaluation of air ions, the susceptibility constant of bacteriophage MS2 to positive, negative, bipolar air ions was calculated as 5.5×10−3, 5.4×10−3 and 9.5×10−3, respectively. These susceptibility constants showed bipolar ion treatment was more effective about 1.7 times than unipolar ion treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
