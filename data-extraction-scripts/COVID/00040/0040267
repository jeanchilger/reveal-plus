This study describes the isolation, molecular characterization and analysis of pathogenicity of MRV variant B/03 from wild short-nosed fruit bats. Negative stain electron microscopy illustrated that the B/03 strain is a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with a diameter of 70nm. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) migration patterns showed that the B/03 viral genome contains 10 segments in a 3:3:4 arrangement. The isolate belongs to MRV serotype 1 based on S1 gene nucleotide sequence data. BALB/c mice experimentally infected with B/03 virus by intranasal inoculation developed severe respiratory distress with tissue damage and inflammation. Lastly, B/03 virus has an increased transmission risk between bats and humans or animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
