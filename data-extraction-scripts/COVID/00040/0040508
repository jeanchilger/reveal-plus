<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1993-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Coronavirus Infection in Cats</TITLE><BODY>Cats are susceptible to natural infection with several strains of feline coronavirus that result in either effusive and noneffusive feline infectious peritonitis or enteritis. Excretion of coronavirus by infected cats into the environment occurs by way of feces, oronasal secretions, and possibly urine. Clinical diagnosis of coronavirus infection is made by evaluating the case history, physical findings, laboratory results, and coronavirus antibody titers as well as ruling out analogous diseases. An intranasal temperature-sensitive feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus vaccine is available for use in healthy cats 16 weeks of age or older.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
