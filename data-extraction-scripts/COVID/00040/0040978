Sias interact with microbes of many types, and are the targets of specific recognition by many different viruses. They may mediate virus binding and infection of cells, or alternatively can act as decoy receptors that bind virions and block virus infection. These nine-carbon backbone monosaccharides naturally occur in many different modified forms, and are attached to underlying glycans through varied linkages, creating significant diversity in the pathogen receptor forms. Here we review the current knowledge regarding the distribution of modified Sias in different vertebrate hosts, tissues, and cells, their effects on viral pathogens where those have been examined, and outline unresolved questions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
