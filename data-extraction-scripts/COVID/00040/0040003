These are herpes-, rota-, corona-, bunya- and poxviruses. Our main emphasis will be on the virally-encoded membrane glycoproteins that are responsible for determining the site of virus assembly. In a number of cases these proteins have been well characterized and appear to serve as resident markers of the budding compartments. The assembly and dissemination of these viruses raises many questions of cell biological interest.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
