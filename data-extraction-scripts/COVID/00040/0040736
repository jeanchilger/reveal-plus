To date, vaccines developed against HEV still need to be improved and a structural gene (ORF2), which encodes a capsid protein with high sequence conservation found across HEV genotypes, is a potential candidate. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against HEV infection, four small interference RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting ORF2 gene were constructed. A challenge against HEV infection by RNAi was performed in A549 cells. Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time qPCR) and Western blot assay demonstrated that four HEV specific siRNAs (si-ORF2-1, si-ORF2-2, si-ORF2-3 and si-ORF2-4) were capable of protecting cells against HEV infection with very high specificity and efficiency. The results suggest that RNAi is a potent anti-HEV infection prophylaxis strategy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
