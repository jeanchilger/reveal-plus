The 4.9- and 4.8-kDa proteins appear to be vestiges of an 11-kDa protein for which a single nucleotide deletion event in the central part of the gene gave rise to a stop codon. The consensus CYAAAC sequence precedes the 4.9-, 12.7-, and 9.5-kDa ORFs and predicts that transcription will start from each of these sites. Northern analyses using sequence-specific probes and oligo(dT)-selected RNA demonstrated that the predicted transcripts are made, and that these correspond to mRNAs 4, 5, and 5-1. BCV mRNA 4 appears to be a counterpart to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mRNA 4 which, in the MHV JHM strain, encodes the putative 15.2-kDa nonstructural protein. BCV mRNAs 5 and 5-1 appear to be used for the synthesis of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins, respectively, which demonstrates a pattern of expression strikingly different from that utilized by MHV. MHV makes its homologs of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins from the single mRNA 5. In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the BCV 9.5-kDa protein, unlike its MHV counterpart, is poorly made from downstream initiation of translation. Thus, from a comparison between BCV and MHV we find evolutionary evidence for the importance of the CYAAAC sequence in regulating coronavirus transcription.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
