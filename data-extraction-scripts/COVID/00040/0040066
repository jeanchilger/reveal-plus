<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-09-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Human Health Link to Invasive Species</TITLE><BODY>Invasive species are currently a far-reaching, interdisciplinary topic given their broad impacts on biodiversity, economics, and human health, with representatives from all taxonomic levels (e.g., viruses, bacteria, algae, plants, invertebrates, large mammals). Researchers from different fields are working to build a framework for understanding how to best evaluate, quantify, and predict different kinds of impacts by non-indigenous species (NIS). In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e., initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g., changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g., costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g., epidemics or increased exposure to hazards). Current research highlights the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species as both a consequence and cause of global change with repercussions on ecosystems, economies, and human societies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
