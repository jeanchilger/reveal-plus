In this study, we showed that lymphopenia observed in FIP cats was due to apoptosis, and that the ascitic fluid, plasma, and culture supernatant of peritoneal exudate cells (adherent cells with macrophage morphology, or PEC) from FIP cats readily induced apoptosis in specific pathogen-free cat peripheral blood mononuclear cells, particularly CD8+ cells. In addition, TNF-alpha released from macrophages and TNF-receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2 mRNA expression in lymphocytes were closely involved in this apoptosis induction. In particular, in CD8+ cells cultured in the presence of the PEC culture supernatant, the expression levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 mRNA were increased, indicating that CD8+ cells are more susceptible to apoptosis induction by TNF-alpha than other lymphocyte subsets, particularly B cells (CD21+ cells). The results of this study suggest that TNF-alpha, produced by virus-infected macrophages, is responsible for induction of apoptosis in uninfected T cells, primarily CD8+ T cells.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
