The (31)P NMR and XPS results indicated that POM was bound to the Ormosil and Ormosil(NR(4)(+)Cl(−)) hybrids after impregnation. The antibacterial effects of the hybrids and hybrid-impregnated fabrics against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were investigated with zone of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and plate-counting method. The MIC/MBC values of Ormosil(NR(4)(+)Cl(−))/POM and Ormosil/POM against bacteria were 0.267/2.67 and 2.67/26.7, respectively, and the percentage reduction of bacteria was approximately 100% after 20 laundry cycles of their fabrics. The reaction products and mechanisms of the adsorptive degradation of 2-chloroethylethylsulfide (CEES) by hybrids were investigated with (13)C NMR. The results of this study showed that POM-doped Ormosil systems are capable of destroying bacteria and CEES.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
