<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020</DATELINE><TITLE>A potential role for integrins in host cell entry by SARS-CoV-2</TITLE><BODY>• Integrin may act as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and could be implicated in its transmission and pathology. • The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 acquired a RGD motif known to bind integrins. This motif is absent from other coronaviruses. • The integrin-binding motif is present at the surface of the spike protein, close to the ACE2 receptor-binding region. • Integrin binding may be a promising therapeutics target, and should be tested experimentally.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
