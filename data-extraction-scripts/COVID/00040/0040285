<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Status presens of antiviral drugs and strategies: Part II: RNA VIRUSES (EXCEPT RETROVIRUSES)</TITLE><BODY>More than 40 compounds have been formally licensed for clinical use as antiviral drugs, and half of these are used for the treatment of HIV infections. The others have been approved for the therapy of herpesvirus (HSV, VZV, CMV), hepadnavirus (HBV), hepacivirus (HCV) and myxovirus (influenza, RSV) infections. New compounds are in clinical development or under preclinical evaluation, and, again, half of these are targeting HIV infections. Yet, quite a number of important viral pathogens (i.e. HPV, HCV, hemorrhagic fever viruses) remain in need of effective and/or improved antiviral therapies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
