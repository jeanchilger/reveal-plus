Previous reports suggested that many important regulatory proteins in innate immune pathway may be modified by ubiquitin and that many de-ubiquitination (DUB) proteins may affect immunity. Monocyte chemotactic protein-inducing protein 1 (MCPIP1), one of the CCCH Zn finger-containing proteins, was reported to have DUB function, but its effect on IFNβ innate immune was not fully understood. In this study, we uncovered a novel mechanism that may explain how MCPIP1 efficiently inhibits IFNβ innate immune. It was found that MCPIP1 negatively regulates the IFNβ expression activated by RIG-I, STING, TBK1, IRF3. Furthermore, MCPIP1 inhibits the nuclear translocation of IRF3 upon stimulation with virus, which plays a key role in type I IFN expression. Additionally, MCPIP1 interacts with important modulators of IFNβ expression pathway including IPS1, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKε. Meanwhile, the interaction between the components in TRAF3-TBK1-IKKε complex was disrupted by MCPIP1. These results collectively suggest MCPIP1 as an innate immune regulator encoded by the host and point to a new mechanism through which MCPIP1 negatively regulates IRF3 activation and type I IFNβ expression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
