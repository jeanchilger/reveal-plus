Among these analogues, two compounds, namely, 1 and 11, exhibited promising anti-SARS-CoV activity that was comparable to those of mizoribine and ribavirin, which are known anti-SARS-CoV agents. Moreover, we observed several SAR trends such as the antiviral effects of the 6-chloropurine moiety, unprotected 5′-hydroxyl group and benzoylated 5′-hydroxyl group.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
