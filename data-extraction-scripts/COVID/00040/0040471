However, T cells are incapable of recognizing native antigens. Instead, they recognize processed peptides presented by MHC molecules. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that inform the fight against invasive pathogens while enforcing tolerance to self and harmless environmental antigens. They capture pathogens and receive signals from pathogens that influence the outcome of immune responses. On the basis of these signals, DCs orchestrate antigen specific T cell differentiation. Alternatively they can silence self-reactive T cells by inducing deletion, anergy or regulation (Treg). This article will discuss the discovery, function and development of DCs and the mechanisms by which they link innate immunity to adaptive immunity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
