Gen. Virol. 66, 719–726). The order of the two glycopolypeptides within So is aminoterminus(N)-Sl-S2-carboxyterminus(C). To locate the N-terminus of S2 we have performed partial amino acid sequencing on S2 from IBV-Beaudette labelled with [3H]serine and from the related strain IBV-M41 labelled with [3H]valine, leucine and isoleucine. The residues identified and their positions relative to the N-terminus of S2 were: serine, 13; valine, 6, 12; leucine, none in the first 20 residues; isoleucine, 2, 19. These results identified the N-terminus of S2 of IBV-Beaudette as serine, 520 residues from the N-terminus of S1, excluding the signal sequence. Immediately to the N-terminal side of residue 520 So has the sequence Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg; similar basic connecting peptides are a feature of several other virus spike glycoproteins. It was deduced that for IBV-Beaudette SI comprises 519 residues (M r 57.0K) or 514 residues (56.2K) if the connecting peptide was to be removed by carboxypeptidase-like activity in vivo while S2 has 625 residues (69.2K). Nucleotide sequencing of the cleavage region of the So gene of IBV-M41 revealed the same connecting peptide as IBV-Beaudette and that the first 20 N-terminal residues of S2 of IBV-M41 were identical to those of the Beaudette strain. IBV-Beaudette grown in Vero cells had some uncleaved So; this was cleavable by 10 μg/ml of trypsin and of chymotrypsin. Partial N-terminal analysis of S1 from IBV-M41 identified leucine and valine residues at positions 2 and 9 respectively from the N-terminus. This confirms the identification made by Binns et al. (1985), of the N-terminus of S1 and the end of the signal sequence of the IBV-Beaudette spike propolypeptide. N-terminal sequencing of [3H]leucine-labelled IBV-Beaudette membrane (M) polypeptide showed leucine residues at positions 8,16 and 22 from the N-terminus; these results confirm the open reading frame identified by M.E.G. Boursnell et al. (1984, Virus Res. 1, 303–313) in the nucleotide sequence of M. The N-terminus of the nucleocapsid (n) polypeptide appeared to be blocked.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
