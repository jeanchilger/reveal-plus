Majority of these viruses have not been isolated and there is little information regarding their biology in bats. Establishing a well-characterized bat cell line supporting the replication of bat-borne viruses would facilitate the analysis of virus-host interactions in an in vitro model. Currently, few bat cell lines have been developed and only Tb1-Lu, derived from Tadarida brasiliensis is commercially available. Here we describe a method to establish and immortalize big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) kidney (Efk3) cells using the Myotis polyomavirus T-antigen. Subclones of this cell line expressed both epithelial and fibroblast markers to varying extents. Cell clones expressed interferon beta in response to poly(I:C) stimulation and supported the replication of four different viruses, namely, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PED-CoV), Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). To our knowledge, this is the first bat cell line from a northern latitude insectivorous bat developed using a novel technology. The cell line has the potential to be used for isolation of bat viruses and for studying virus-bat interactions in culture.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
