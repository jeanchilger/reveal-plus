Conjugation of GL with l-amino acids or their methyl esters, and amino sugar (d-galactose amine) dramatically changed its activity. The most active compounds were GL conjugates with aromatic amino acids methyl esters (phenylalanine and tyrosine) (SI=61 and 38), and S-benzyl-cysteine (SI=71). Thus modification of GL is a perspective route in the search of new antivirals, and some of GL derivatives are potent as anti-influenza A/H1N1 agents.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
