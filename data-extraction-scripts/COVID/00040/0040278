Subclinical infections were established in only 50% of the cats, none of which became long-term carriers of the organism. Cytological examination of vaginal smears was of no diagnostic value in confirming infection in inapparently infected cats. Bacteriological responses after primary or secondary challenge with the CEM organism were essentially similar, with one exception, a female cat in which there was possible evidence of local immunity persisting after the primary infection. Efforts to reactivate shedding subsequent to the immediate post-challenge period were unsuccessful. Throughout the experimental period, the cats remained sero-negative to the complement-fixation test, and they failed to develop any significant increase in the levels of antibody activity as measured by the kinetics-based ELISA or KELA system. On day 89 after primary challenge, the cats were euthanized and various sites in the genitourinary tract and the internal iliac lymphatic glands subjected to bacteriological and pathological examination for evidence of CEM infection with negative results. The findings of this study, although establishing the transmissibility of the CEM organism for the cat, demonstrate the limited value of this species as an experimental model system for the disease in the horse.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
