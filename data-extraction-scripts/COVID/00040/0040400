Nine derivatives showed potent activity with IC50 values from 0.48 to 6.22μM. 5-Oxo-13-TBDMS-taxchinin A (11) and 5-oxo-13,15-epoxy-13-epi-taxchinin A (15) are the most potent derivatives, with IC50 at 0.48 and 0.75μM, respectively. The structure–activity relationship (SAR) of these compounds established that exocyclic unsaturated ketone at ring C is the key structural element for the activity, while the α,β-unsaturated ketone positioned at ring A has no effect for the activity. The significant cytotoxicity of derivatives 11 and 15 may be due to the conformational change in the taxane rings. The 3D-QSAR study was conducted on this series of compounds, which provided optimal predictive comparative molecular field (CoMFA) model with cross-validated r 2 (q 2) value of 0.64.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
