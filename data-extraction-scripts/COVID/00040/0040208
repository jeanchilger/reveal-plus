This system was applied to develop a quantitative measurement of cell–cell fusion using hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease and a secretion-blocked EGFP-4A/4B-SEAP (EGFP: enhanced green fluorescent protein; 4A/4B: a decapeptide substrate of NS3/4A protease; SEAP: secreted alkaline phosphatase) fusion gene. Both genes were transiently expressed in either of the CHO cell lines, followed by fusion treatment. Significant SEAP activity could be detected in the culture medium only after cell–cell fusion occurred. Cell–cell fusion provides an environment in which the protease encounters its substrate 4A/4B, thereby releasing SEAP from the fusion protein. In this study, we developed a simple, sensitive, and quantitative assay to study the membrane fusion process by measuring the extracellular activity of SEAP.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
