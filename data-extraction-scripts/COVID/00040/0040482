From a total of 79 rectal swab samples that have been submitted to our laboratory since 2008, 55 (69.6%) resulted positive and were further analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. Fifty positives samples (91%) were characterized as CPV2c variant, which appeared in Argentina in the year 2003 and has been the prevalent type since 2008, whereas CPV2a and CPV2b, still found in Argentine dogs, were represented in 3.6% and 5.4% of the population, respectively. Considering that CPV2c is spreading worldwide, and that this variant is also affecting vaccinated dogs, efforts should be made towards the development of new matched CPV vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
