The recombinant plasmid pGEX-6p-M′ was constructed and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression. SDS-PAGE analysis showed recombinant truncated M′ protein was highly expressed by pGEX-6p-M′ and the product fusion protein GST-M′ reached 45% in the total bacteria proteins with the analysis of software AlphaImager2200. The preliminary purified recombinant protein was evaluated for its antigenicity and reactivity through Western blotting and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibody against M protein of PEDV and porcine polyclonal anti-PEDV antiserum as the primary antibody. The results indicated the recombinant truncated M′ protein should be candidate as a feasible recombinant diagnostic reagent.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
