Therefore, in order to overcome the limitations, many researchers have focused on the development of new immunological and molecular based rapid assays that could enable early diagnosis of infection and accurate identification of fungal pathogens causing superficial and invasive infection. In this brief review, we highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of conventional diagnostic methods and possibility of non-culture based assays in diagnosis of superficial fungal infections and presented the overview on currently available immunochromatographic assays as well as availability of biomarkers detection by immunodiagnostic procedures in prompt and accurate diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. In addition, we presented diagnostic efficiency of currently available molecular panels and researches in this area.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
