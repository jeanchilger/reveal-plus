One of the contextual factors that may change the nature of these relationships is firm age. As such, the aim of this study is to investigate the moderating influence of firm age on airline performance outcomes. Thirty airline companies from the Asia Pacific region were selected, and relevant data from 2006 to 2011 were collected. It can be deduced that company experience or firm age can help in taking control of the relationship between the constructs; thus, this measurement acts as a moderator in the research model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
