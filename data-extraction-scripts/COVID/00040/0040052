The amphiphilic nature of the transmembrane α-helical domain is consistent with the protein forming a transmembrane channel with which amantadine, the specific anti-influenza A drug, interacts. Together these features provide a structural basis for the hypothesis that M2 has a proton translocation function capable of regulating the pH of vesicles of the trans-Golgi network, a role important in promoting the correct maturation of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
