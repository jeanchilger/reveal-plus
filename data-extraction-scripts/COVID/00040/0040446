<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005-03-18</DATELINE><TITLE>The development of vaccines against SARS corona virus in mice and SCID-PBL/hu mice</TITLE><BODY>We have investigated to develop novel vaccines against SARS CoV using cDNA constructs encoding the structural antigen; spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), or nucleocapsid (N) protein, derived from SARS CoV. Mice vaccinated with SARS-N or -M DNA using pcDNA 3.1(+) plasmid vector showed T cell immune responses (CTL induction and proliferation) against N or M protein, respectively. CTL responses were also detected to SARS DNA-transfected type II alveolar epithelial cells (T7 cell clone), which are thought to be initial target cells for SARS virus infection in human. To determine whether these DNA vaccines could induce T cell immune responses in humans as well as in mice, SCID-PBL/hu mice was immunized with these DNA vaccines. As expected, virus-specific CTL responses and T cell proliferation were induced from human T cells. SARS-N and SARS-M DNA vaccines and SCID-PBL/hu mouse model will be important in the development of protective vaccines.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
