Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV encode an envelope (E) protein, a small, hydrophobic membrane protein. We report that, in planar lipid bilayers, synthetic peptides corresponding to the SARS-CoV E protein forms ion channels that are more permeable to monovalent cations than to monovalent anions. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies recognizing the N-terminal 19 residues of SARS-CoV E protein were used to establish the specificity of channel formation by inhibiting the ion currents generated in the presence of the E protein peptides.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
