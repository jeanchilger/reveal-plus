However, telemedicine as a potential tool during epidemics is not as well considered. Methods In this paper, the application of telemedicine is conceptualised using five possible evidence-based epidemic situations. Results The first situation corresponds to asymptomatic individuals, mainly home-based, living in an epidemic-affected location. The application of telemedicine would be through the use of teleconsultation for emergency medical dispatching and would occur when suspicious symptoms are detected by an individual. The second situation for the application of telemedicine is principally home-based and corresponds to the follow-up telemonitoring of asymptomatic individuals identified as case contacts. Concrete applications of these concepts were used during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Africa since 2014. The third situation links to symptomatic cases in need of isolation. Examples include patients isolated in Taiwan during SARS epidemic in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic influenza in 2009, as well as H7N9 influenza infected patients in 2013 in China. The fourth situation involves tele-expertise when local medical resources do not have the technical expertise for the diagnosis or treatment of a patient and support is required from reference centres. The fifth situation corresponds to a healthcare facility under quarantine that would use telemedicine to keep taking care of patients that cannot access the facility, as it was the case in June 2015 in Seoul during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus epidemic. Conclusion The use of telemedicine in epidemic situations has a high potential in improving epidemiological investigations, disease control, and clinical case management. However, since it is a recent application, further research would be needed to gain an improved understanding of how telemedicine could be applied in epidemic situations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
