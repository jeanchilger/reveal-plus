<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Prevalence of antibodies against feline coronavirus and Chlamydophila felis in Swedish cats</TITLE><BODY>Serum samples from 214 Swedish cats with no signs of infectious disease were analysed for the presence of antibodies against Chlamydophila felis (Cp felis), while 209 of these were also analysed for feline coronavirus (FCoV) antibodies. The prevalence of antibodies against Cp felis was 11%, with no significant difference between purebred and mixed breed cats. The overall prevalence of antibodies against FCoV was 31%, significantly higher among pure breed cats (65%) than among mixed breed cats (17%). A high proportion of cats with antibodies against FCoV had relatively high antibody titres, and was therefore likely to be shedding FCoV in faeces. For Cp felis, the majority of seropositive animals had relatively low antibody titres, and the risk of these animals infecting others is not known.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
