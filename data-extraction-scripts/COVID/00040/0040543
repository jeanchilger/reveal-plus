As our understanding of secretory immunoglobulins and lymphocyte migration patterns continues to develop, the immunologic components found in breast milk appear increasingly likely to play a specific immunologic role in the protection of the nursing infant. The biologic basis for the observed protective effect of breast-feeding is reviewed with an emphasis on the mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of mucosal immunity in general.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
