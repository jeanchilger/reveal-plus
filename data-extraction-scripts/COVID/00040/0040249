Moreover, viruses can quickly adapt to the host's immune response and drug treatment. Although they tend to make optimal use of the host cell's reservoir of proteins, viruses need to carry some enzymatic functions with them, as they may not be available or accessible in the infected cell. Recently, progress has been made in our structural understanding of viral enzymes involved in all stages of the viral life cycle, which includes entry, hijack, replication and exit stages.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
