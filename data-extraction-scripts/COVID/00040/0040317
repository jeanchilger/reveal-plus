Enterotropic strains predominate in natural infections, and molecular techniques for the detection of MHV shedding in feces are powerful enough to diagnose active infections. A reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique was developed for the detection of rodent coronaviruses within 90min. The specificity of this technique was confirmed by its ability to detect all 17 different strains of MHV and 6 strains of rat coronaviruses as well as its failure to detect human, bovine, and porcine coronaviruses nonspecifically. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 3.2-fold higher than that of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 31.6-fold lower than that of nested RT-PCR. An evaluation of the diagnostic performance of RT-LAMP performed in duplicate using mouse fecal specimens showed that the sensitivity and specificity with respect to nested RT-PCR were 85.7% and 100%, respectively. RT-LAMP assays would be suitable for monitoring active MHV infection in mouse colonies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
