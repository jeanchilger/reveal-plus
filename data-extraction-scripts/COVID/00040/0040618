Despite the availability of PEDV vaccines in the domestic market, the disease continues to plague the Korean pork industry, raising issues regarding their protective efficacy and new vaccine development. Therefore, PEDV isolation in cell culture is urgently needed to develop efficacious vaccines and diagnostic assays and to conduct further studies on the virus biology. In the present study, one Korean PEDV strain, KOR/KNU-141112/2014, was successfully isolated and serially propagated in Vero cells for over 30 passages. The in vitro and in vivo characteristics of the Korean PEDV isolate were investigated. Virus production in cell culture was confirmed by cytopathology, immunofluorescence, and real-time RT-PCR. The infectious virus titers of the viruses during the first 30 passages ranged from 105.1 to 108.2 TCID50 per ml. The inactivated KNU-141112 virus was found to mediate potent neutralizing antibody responses in immunized guinea pigs. Animal studies showed that KNU-141112 virus causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, fecal shedding, and acute atrophic enteritis, indicating that strain KNU-141112 is highly enteropathogenic in the natural host. In addition, the entire genomes or complete S genes of KNU-141112 viruses at selected cell culture passages were sequenced to assess the genetic stability and relatedness. Our genomic analyses indicated that the Korean isolate KNU-141112 is genetically stable during the first 30 passages in cell culture and is grouped within subgroup G2b together with the recent re-emergent Korean strains.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
