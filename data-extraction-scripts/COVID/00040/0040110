<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-03-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Pharyngitis</TITLE><BODY>Most infectious pharyngitis has a viral cause. The use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIAs) is advised in adults and NSAIAs in children for the treatment of pain. There are several studies that show that NSAIAs relieve pharyngitis pain better than acetaminophen. Penicillin remains the antibiotic of choice of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis. Resistance has not developed to penicillin. Patients with GAS pharyngitis should have improvement in 3 to 4 days. If not better at that time, the patient should be seen for diagnostic reconsideration or the development of a suppurative complication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
