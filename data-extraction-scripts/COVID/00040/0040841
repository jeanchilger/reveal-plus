Here we describe generation of a recombinant antibody Fc-9E2 comprising a fusion protein between human Fc of IgG1 and a single-chain Fv derived from a hybridoma 9E2 secreting a mAb neutralizing West Nile virus (WNV). Fc-9E2 was shown to retain parental mAb's specificity and WNV-neutralizing capacity. Adenovirus-mediated in vivo delivery of the antibody gene resulted in sustained Fc-9E2 serum levels leading to abrogation of lethal WNV infection in an animal model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
