<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2009-02-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Infections</TITLE><BODY>Although influenza remains indisputably the most significant viral pathogen in adults, other viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus are now recognized as significant pathogens in older populations. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are antiviral agents that are effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B. For treatment and for optimal effect, therapy should be initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. Infection with hepatitis viruses may be more severe in older adults with more fulminate disease as observed with acute hepatitis A and a more rapid progression to cirrhosis with hepatitis C. Outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis are common in long-term care facilities, and infection may lead to death due to dehydration and oliguria. The incidence of herpes zoster increases with advancing age and carries with it a significant risk of post herpetic neuralgia. The use of antiviral medications and corticosteroids may reduce the incidence and severity of chronic pain.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
