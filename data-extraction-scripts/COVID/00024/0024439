<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-12-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</TITLE><BODY>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a well-described disease process that can have numerous underlying causes, is commonly seen in the critical care setting, and is often under-recognized. ARDS is characterized by pulmonary edema with refractory hypoxemia, and was traditionally associated with a high mortality rate. The past few decades have generated many studies examining therapeutic interventions for ARDS; however, there are few Level 1 evidence-based interventions to this day that have been shown to improve mortality and outcomes. Lung protective ventilation remains the most studied and evidence-based intervention for the treatment of ARDS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
