<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008</DATELINE><TITLE>Origins of the regulated secretory pathway</TITLE><BODY>Modes of transport of soluble (or luminal) secretory proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) could be divided into two groups. The socalled constitutive secretory pathway (CSP) is common to all eukaryotic cells, constantly delivering constitutive soluble secretory proteins (CSSPs) linked to the rate of protein synthesis but largely independent of external stimuli. In regulated secretion, protein is sorted from the Golgi into storage/secretory granules (SGs) whose contents are released when stimuli trigger their final fusion with the plasma membrane (Hannah et al. 1999).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
