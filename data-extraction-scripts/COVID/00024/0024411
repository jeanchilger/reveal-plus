<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-03-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Mammalia: Chiroptera: Immunology of Bats</TITLE><BODY>Bats are a large and diverse group comprising approximately 20% of all living mammalian species. They are the only mammals capable of powered flight and have many unique characteristics, including long lifespans, echolocation, and hibernation, and play key roles in insect control, pollination, and seed dispersal. The role of bats as natural reservoirs of a variety of high-profile viruses that are highly pathogenic in other susceptible species yet cause no clinical disease in bats has led to a resurgence of interest in their immune systems. Equally compelling is the urgency to understand the immune mechanisms responsible for the susceptibility of bats to the fungus responsible for white syndrome, which threatens to wipe out a number of species of North American bats. In this chapter we review the current knowledge in the field of bat immunology, focusing on recent highlights and the need for further investigations in this area.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
