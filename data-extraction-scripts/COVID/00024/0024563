<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012</DATELINE><TITLE>Characterization of Synonymous Codon Usage in the Newly Identified Duck Plague Virus UL16 Gene</TITLE><BODY>A comparative analysis of the codon usage bias in the newly identified UL16 gene(GenBank accession no.EU195095) of DPV and the UL16 gene of 22 reference herpesviruses was performed. In this study, the synonymous codon usage bias of UL16 gene in the 23 herpesviruses have been analyzed and the results showed obvious differences by the CAI, RSCU, ENC and GC(3s). The results revealed that the synonymous codons with A and T at the third codon positon have widely usage in the codon of UL16 gene of DPV. The ENC-GC(3s) plot revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in UL16 gene of herpesviruses was constrained by G+C content at the third codon position. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that DPV was evolutionarily closer to herpesviruses which further clustered into Alphaherpesvirinae. Furthermore the ORF of DPV UL16 gene has sequential rare codons. There were 21 codons showing distinct usage differences between DPV with Escherichia coli, 19 codons showing distinct usage differences between DPV with yeast, and 20 between DPV and Human. Therefore the Escherichia coli, Yeast and Human expression system were suitable for the expression of DPV UL16 gene if some codons could be optimized.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
