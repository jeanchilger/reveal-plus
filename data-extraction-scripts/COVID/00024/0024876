In the first edition of this book, we described an overview of the isotope labeling methods available at that time. In this second edition, we will mainly focus on newer isotope-aided NMR methods, such as the methyl-specific labeling and stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) methods, which have rapidly developed during the past decade. The methyl-specific labeling is currently used as the most practical technique applicable to large protein complexes and membrane proteins. The standard methyl labeling protocols employ isotope-labeled α-keto acid precursors, which enable selective observations of the methyl groups of Ile, Leu, and Val residues. More recently, the stereo-specific isotope labeling methods of prochiral methyl groups have become available, using either regio-selectively isotope-labeled precursors or stereo-specifically (13)CH(3)-labeled amino acids. We also focus on the stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method, which is a breakthrough isotope labeling technology using stereo- and regio-selectively [(2)H, (13)C, (15)N]-labeled amino acids with isotope labeling patterns optimized for NMR studies. Various applications of SAIL and related methods to structural studies, including protein dynamics such as aromatic ring-flipping motions, hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates, conformational analysis, and dynamics about disulfide bonds, will be discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
