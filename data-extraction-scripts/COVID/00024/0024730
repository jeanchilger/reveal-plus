Being nature’s antioxidants flavonoids have been shown to reduce the damages induced by oxidative stress in cells. Besides being an antioxidant, flavonols are demonstrated to have anti-infective properties, i.e., antiviral, antifungal, anti-angiogenic, anti-tumorigenic, and immunomodulatory bioproperties. Plants use them as one of their defense mechanisms against radiation-induced DNA damage and also for fungal infections. The use of flavonols for fabrication of new drugs has been underway with objectives to develop safer and effective therapeutic agents. This review covers 15 flavonols for their structure, biological properties, role in plant metabolisms, and current research focused on computational drug design using flavonols for searching drug leads.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
