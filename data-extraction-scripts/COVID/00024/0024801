<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-11-28</DATELINE><TITLE>Pederin, Psymberin and the Structurally Related Mycalamides: Synthetic Aspects and Biological Activities</TITLE><BODY>Pederin, psymberin, and mycalamides are related members of a relatively new family of potent natural antiviral and antitumor compounds originally isolated from marine sponges in 1988. This natural family of chemicals is of great interest to medicinal chemists and biologists, stemming from its extremely low abundance in source organisms and strikingly potent biological activity. They have clearly emerged as promising new synthetic targets, and are the focus of quite an interdisciplinary approach to molecular characterization. In this chapter we review diverse synthetic approaches to this family of natural products that has been demonstrating remarkable biological activity. We discuss relevant history, biological origins with the latest information on source organisms and their hosts, in-depth synthetic approaches, and biological data supporting their potential as therapeutic compounds.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
