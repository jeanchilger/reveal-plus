Numerous fatal causalities were described in the international environment. For example fatal causalities during the SARS-Epidemic as well as cases of death caused by influenza. METHODS AND RESULTS: Selective literature review of occupationally acquired aerogene infections like SARS-coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, tuberculosis as well as pertussis. Currently available data demonstrate that personal protective measures (e.g. appropriate use of hand washing and oronasal mask), as well as vaccinations (if available) reduces the risk for transmission of infectious diseases. DISCUSSION: The risk for occupationally acquired infections is sometimes an unavoidable part of daily patient care. From occupational medicine point of view and for control of infectious diseases preventive measures should be implemented to provide the best possible protection of HCW involved. With regard to a possible pandemic (e.g. influenza pandemic) this procedure is absolutely required.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
