<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-07-16</DATELINE><TITLE>Healthcare-Associated Viral Infections: Considerations for Nosocomial Transmission and Infection Control</TITLE><BODY>Nosocomial and healthcare-associated viral infections are major contributors to patient morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and increased healthcare costs in all pediatric age groups. Healthcare workers are also at risk of acquiring nosocomial viral infections, affecting their own health, as well as facilitating spread of the infection to other patients, their family, and the community. Healthcare-associated viral infections may occur in a variety of healthcare settings, including clinics, emergency centers, urgent care centers, procedure suites, operating rooms, hospital wards, nurseries, and intensive care units. In addition, non-patient care areas, such as the cafeteria, waiting areas, and playrooms may also be a source of viral infections that can spread in the healthcare setting. These infections may be device-related or transmitted via blood products or organ donation and respiratory droplets, through food including human milk, person to person, or via air ducts, fomites, and surfaces. They most commonly involve the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts; however, all organ systems may potentially be involved. Both DNA and RNA viruses, either common or exotic, may contribute to healthcare-associated viral infections. Advances in molecular viral diagnostics have enabled rapid detection and routine surveillance for viral infections and now allow early identification of viruses. Prompt identification allows timely containment measures to minimize transmission to other patients or healthcare workers and avoids hospital, community, and global outbreaks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
