<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-06-07</DATELINE><TITLE>The Emerging Threat of Ebola</TITLE><BODY>Ebola is one of the deadliest infectious disease of the modern era. Over 50% of those infected die. Prior to 1976, the disease was unknown. No one knows exactly where it came from, but it is postulated that a mutation in an animal virus allowed it to jump species and infect humans. In 1976 simultaneous outbreaks of Ebola occurred in what is now South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). For 20 years, only sporadic cases were seen, but in 1995 a new outbreak occurred killing hundreds in the DRC. Since that time the frequency of these outbreaks has been increasing. It is uncertain why this is occurring, but many associate it with increasing human encroachment into forested areas bringing people and animals into more intimate contact and increased mobility of previously remote population. This chapter will navigate Ebola in the context of global health and security. There are multiple objectives of this chapter. First is to provide a basic understanding of Ebola disease processes and outbreak patterns. Second, is to explore the interplay between social determinants of health and Ebola. The role of technology in spreading Ebola outbreaks will be explained as will Ebola’s potential as a bioweapon. Readers will gain understanding of the link between environmental degradation and Ebola outbreaks. This chapter will be divided into five main sections. These are (1) a case study; (2) Ebola Disease process; (3) Social determinants of health and Ebola; (4) Ebola in the modern era, and (5) the link between Ebola and environmental degradation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
