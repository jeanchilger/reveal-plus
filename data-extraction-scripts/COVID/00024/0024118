Several viruses, from variable families, cause upper respiratory infections which, although generally underestimated due to their typically self-limiting nature, underlie enormous healthcare resource utilization and financial burden. Such, otherwise “benign” infections, can have very significant sequelae both in the form of bringing about local complications but also inducing asthma attacks, thus greatly increasing morbidity. Their enormous prevalence also indicates that rigorous research should be undertaken in order to tackle them, in both the prevention and treatment field.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
