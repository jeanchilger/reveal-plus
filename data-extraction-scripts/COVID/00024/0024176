<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-01-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Infection and Inflammation: Catalysts of Pulmonary Morbidity in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</TITLE><BODY>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most frequent pulmonary morbidity among survivors of prematurity. While the precise cause remains unknown, both antenatal factors, and specifically chorioamnionitis, as well as bacterial sepsis, cytomegalovirus infection, and respiratory viral infections have been associated with the pathogenesis of BPD. This chapter will focus on the impact that inflammation and infection have on the development of BPD in preterm infants and its long-term pulmonary morbidities. Knowledge of the respiratory tract microbiome and virome and their role in the development of BPD constitutes a major knowledge gap in our continuing efforts to decrease the incidence of BPD and its consequences.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
