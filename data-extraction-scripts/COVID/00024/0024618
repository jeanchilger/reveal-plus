<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-05-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Lessons Learned and Reordering Policy Prescriptions</TITLE><BODY>The final Chapter 8 offers practical policy suggestions towards (re)ordering health. It takes into account that not all health rights and threats are of the same caliber, that prioritization is a necessity. It also acknowledges that not all risks and threats can be anticipated or annulled. Bearing these limitations in mind, the chapter re-frames health risks in terms of a re-ordering of health security at the level of local, national, and global policy. It also offers theoretical as well as concrete suggestions on how it might be possible to conceptualize, communicate, and confront health risks and threats with states, non-state actors and other agents to facilitate health rights responsibility within and across borders.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
