<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-10-09</DATELINE><TITLE>A Historical Perspective on Paper Microfluidic Based Point-of-Care Diagnostics</TITLE><BODY>Paper-based microfluidic systems have emerged as one of the most favorable technologies used in many potential applications such as point-of-care diagnostics, flexible electronics, energy storage, etc. From the past several decades, paper-based technology has readily accepted in the academic research lab and industries as well. The paper-based devices have changed the life of humankind. The distinguishing characteristics of paper substrate like low cost, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and ease of fabrication helped their adaptability in biosensing applications. This chapter gives a concise overview of the historical perspective of paper-based devices, classification of paper types, and their recent applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
