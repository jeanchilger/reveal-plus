<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006</DATELINE><TITLE>Microspheres for Drug Delivery</TITLE><BODY>With advances in biotechnology, genomics, and combinatorial chemistry, a wide variety of new, more potent and specific therapeutics are being created. Because of common problems such as low solubility, high potency, and/or poor stability of many of these new drugs, the means of drug delivery can impact efficacy and potential for commercialization as much as the nature of the drug itself. Thus, there is a corresponding need for safer and more effective methods and devices for drug delivery. Indeed, drug delivery systems—designed to provide a therapeutic agent in the needed amount, at the right time, to the proper location in the body, in a manner that optimizes efficacy, increases compliance and minimizes side effects—were responsible for $47 billion in sales in 2002, and the drug delivery market is expected to grow to $67 billion by 2006.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
