<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-07-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Society, Differentiation and Globalisation</TITLE><BODY>First, theories of globalisation and their implications for the analysis of health issues are discussed. Emphasis is on: (1) globalisation as embodied, something often overlooked by sociologists working outside of the field of health and (2) health vulnerabilities that arise from the heightened mobility and connectivities that characterise globalisation, taking migration and health as an illustration. Second, differentiation is considered by highlighting disparities in health vulnerability and the capacity of social groups to protect their health. This is illustrated by reference to the securitisation of health and the health consequences of violent conflict and the special vulnerabilities of children and of women. Third, the influence of interconnectedness of various national healthcare systems and implications for the delivery of effective healthcare are considered.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
