<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-09-25</DATELINE><TITLE>Dangerous Microbes</TITLE><BODY>The most dangerous microbes for humans are those that are easily transmitted, virulent and invasive to central organs like the blood and lung, robust survivors in the environment, have a low infection dose and are without any specific treatment or vaccine. Most of them are zoonoses transmitted from animals and often with insects as vectors. The most dangerous microbes cause a very high mortality, are identified as high-risk agents or “biohazard-level 4” agents and are treated at the highest level of infection protection with strict isolation measures. Dangerous microbes occur as a problem mostly in countries with low hygiene standards/high population density and in tropical-subtropical areas. Infection control must always be based on hygienic measures and strict infection protection. This chapter is a short information about the most virulent and pathogenic agents, geographic area and severity of disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
