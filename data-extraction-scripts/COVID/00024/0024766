<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-07-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Perspectives on Global Public Health Informatics</TITLE><BODY>Public health professionals’ functions are rapidly expanding beyond their countries’ borders. Many academic centers are recognizing the importance of global health and are creating programs to train students to meet this growing demand. Global health centers and institutes also are being created to focus on the research and programmatic efforts needed to understand the burden of disease worldwide, as well as the financial, political, medical, policy, workforce, and infrastructure issues surrounding any solutions. Due to this emerging interest by the public health community, we need to understand where the intersection between global health and informatics occurs. For many years, the promise of what technology can do to alleviate suffering and support disease surveillance and other public health activities took precedence over understanding the environment in which the technology has to function. People and their participation in the implementation of the technological solution are critical for success. In resource-poor environments, the deployment of technological solutions faces other challenges for success. Lack of stable electrical power, availability of Internet connections, and a workforce that can support the information technology remain barriers to successful implementation. Yet, through experiences in the implementation of information technology as supported by international donors and the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, lessons are being learned to move forward towards the benefits that global health informatics can bring.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
