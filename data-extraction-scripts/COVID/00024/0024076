Early adoptive T-cell immunotherapy studies showed that administration of allogeneic virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (vCTL) can prevent and control viral infections and reconstitute antiviral immunity to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Advances in immunobiology, in vitro culture technology, and current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) have provided opportunities for advancing adoptive cell therapy for viral infections: (1) T cells have been expanded targeting multiple pathogens; (2) vCTL production no longer requires viral infection or viral vector transduction of antigen-presenting cells (APCs); (3) the source of lymphocytes is no longer restricted to donors who are immune to the pathogens; (4) naive T cells have been redirected with chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CARTs) or armed with bispecific antibody-armed T cells (BATs) to mediate vCTL activity; (5) these technologies could be combined to targeted multiple viral or fungal pathogens; and (6) pathogen-specific T-cell products manufactured from third parties and banked for “off-the-shelf” use post-HSCT may soon become a reality.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
