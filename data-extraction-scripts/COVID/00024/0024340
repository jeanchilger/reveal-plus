<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2011-06-14</DATELINE><TITLE>TLR Signaling and Tumour-Associated Macrophages</TITLE><BODY>The role that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling may have in stimulating macrophages to become tumor promoting is not yet clearly defined. However, given the role macrophages play in restoring tissue homeostasis such as in the tissue repair response, it is likely that tumor-induced TLR signaling provides macrophages with signals of persistent injury. In this chapter, we review the molecular determinants of TLR signaling, the role TLR signaling plays in infection, wound healing, and tumorigenesis and discuss how TLR signaling in tumor-associated macrophages may result in tumor progression.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
