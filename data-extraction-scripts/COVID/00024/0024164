<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-03-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Framing Infectious Diseases: Effective Policy Implementation and United States Public Opinion</TITLE><BODY>This chapter combines quantitative and qualitative research methods—content analysis of newspaper reports and analysis of health opinion polls to assess impact of media frames in shaping public opinion. Focusing on framing of transnational infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, SARS, and avian flu) as medical dangers, economic risks, security threats, and human rights concerns, the chapter draws attention to the role of media frames in enlisting active support and engaging public opinion for effective policy implementation to control spread of these infectious diseases. The findings also address the debate on the role and importance of domestic public opinion as a factor in domestic and foreign policy decisions of governments in an increasingly globalized world.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
