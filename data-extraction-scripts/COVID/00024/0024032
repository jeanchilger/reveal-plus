<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-09-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Minimizing the Impact of Complex Emergencies on Nutrition and Geriatric Health: Planning for Prevention is Key</TITLE><BODY>Complex emergencies (CEs) can occur anywhere and are defined as crisis situations that greatly elevate the risk to nutrition and overall health (morbidity and mortality) of older individuals in the affected area. In urban areas with high population densities and heavy reliance on power-driven devices for day-to-day survival, CEs can precipitate a rapid deterioration of basic services that threatens nutritionally and medically vulnerable older adults. The major underlying threats to nutritional status for older adults during CEs are food insecurity, inadequate social support, and lack of access to health services. The most effective strategy for coping with CEs is to have detailed, individualized pre-event preparations. When a CE occurs, the immediate relief efforts focus on establishing access to food, safe water, and essential medical services.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
