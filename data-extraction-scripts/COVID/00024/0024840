<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-07-14</DATELINE><TITLE>Tonsillitis and Peritonsillar Abscess</TITLE><BODY>Tonsillitis is one of the most common childhood infections. Occasionally, it can lead to one of the most common deep space head and neck infections, peritonsillar abscess. The epidemiology, microbiology and treatment of tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess are similar and crucial for the primary care physician, infectious disease specialist, otolaryngologist, and emergency medicine physician to understand. The routine use of tonsillectomy as a treatment option for recurrent tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess has decreased over the last decade and clearer indications for surgery have emerged. This chapter provides an overview of the most recent literature regarding the epidemiology, microbiology, diagnosis, complications and management of tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess. It also discusses the indications for tonsillectomy along with its complications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
