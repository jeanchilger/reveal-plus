<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-03-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Advancements in Parasite Diagnosis and Challenges in the Management of Parasitic Infections: A Mini Review</TITLE><BODY>Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) remain a widespread public health concern causing severe implications in both developed and developing countries. Globally, numerous studies have been carried out ranging from various communities to schoolchildren as well as indigenous communities. The infections are commonly caused by helminths (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm) and protozoa (e.g. Blastocystis hominis, Cryptosporidium sp., Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia duodenalis). Poor sanitation and poverty are some of the factors associated with IPIs. With the ever-increasing impact of IPIs, newer detection approaches have been developed and studied. The efficacy of diagnostic method is crucial to give an accurate identification of these parasites. Recent developments of diagnostic tools such as serology- and molecular-based assays are assisting the conventional method of microscopy in detecting and further confirming current or past infections and the specific species of parasites. Ongoing investigations in parasitic infections using these advanced tools will provide useful information that will enable the evaluation of the effectiveness of the current control program and thus, assist future planning for improved strategies in eradicating these parasitic infections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
