<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-01-21</DATELINE><TITLE>Indoor Air Pollution and Its Control in China</TITLE><BODY>ABSTRACT: The status of indoor air pollution and its control in China are reviewed by introducing the pollution characteristics of major indoor air pollutants, the strategies and measures adopted to control indoor air pollution, as well as the major problems existing in the current indoor air pollution control. Although indoor pollution of formaldehyde and benzene has been effectively alleviated in recent years in China, indoor pollution of toluene and xylenes is still serious. Besides, studies show that indoor pollution of particulate matter (PM), biological pollutants, and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) might also be serious in China. The establishment and implementation of indoor air quality (IAQ)-related regulations and standards, the research on indoor air pollution and its control, and the development of indoor environmental monitoring and cleaning industry have played significant roles in preventing and controlling indoor air pollution in China. However, problems such as lack of mandatory standards for IAQ, lack of regulation and labeling of pollutant emissions from indoor decorating and refurbishing materials, lack of an effective performance evaluation system for air cleaning products, and lack of proper maintenance of air cleaners remain to be solved for further improvement of IAQ.
