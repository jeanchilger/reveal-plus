<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-12-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Antiviral Probiotics: A New Concept in Medical Sciences</TITLE><BODY>In recent decades, probiotics have shown beneficial effects on animal and human health. Probiotics can protect the host against several health threats, including infectious diseases. Before 1995, researchers believed that the effect of probiotics was only on gut microbiota which can restore the gut flora and thus prevent pathogenic bacteria from triggering gastroenteritis. Recent studies have shown that the immunomodulatory activity is the most important mechanism of action of probiotics. From this information, researchers started to evaluate the effect of some immunobiotics, not only on pathogenic bacteria but also on viruses, including enteric and respiratory viruses. Several studies have confirmed the potential antiviral activity of some probiotics due to the immunomodulatory effect. These studies were conducted on humans (clinical trials) and in animal models. In this chapter, probiotics with antiviral effect against respiratory and enteric viruses will be presented and discussed, as well as their mechanisms of action.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
