<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-06-13</DATELINE><TITLE>Infectious Diseases in Cancer Patients: An Overview</TITLE><BODY>The predisposition of cancer patients to infectious diseases which contribute to the gravity of their prognosis is well documented. The current success in therapy of both malignancies and infections is unprecedented. However, the overall co-morbidity of these conditions is still a major problem in management of these patients.
