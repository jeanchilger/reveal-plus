<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-02-06</DATELINE><TITLE>Dysbiosis, Probiotics, and Prebiotics: In Diseases and Health</TITLE><BODY>The microbiome like any other components of the body undergoes numerous challenges during the life-span of a human being. These complications may involve injuries, aggression by pathogens, pollution, hormonal variations, genetic pre-disposition, unbalanced nutrition and onset of diseases. Although the microbial reconfiguration provoked by these stressors are not immediately evident as in the case of an afflicted visible organ where the abnormality is readily observable, the biological perturbations induced manifest themselves in form of various illnesses. The disruption of a working microbiome is referred to as dysbiosis and is a condition whereby the fine balance between the microbial communities and the host is distressed. Diseases such as cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, acne, gastric ulcers, obesity and hypertension can ensue. The pathogeneses of some pulmonary disorders, digestive complications and neurological abnormalities can be traced to the imbalance in the constituents of the microbiome. However, rebiosis, the re-establishment of the native microbiota is proving to be an excellent remedy against this condition. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are potent therapeutic tools designed to rectify this situation. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus spp are more or less like stem cells utilized to replenish and rejuvenate the microbiome while prebiotics like fructose oligosaccharides (FOS) are microbiome fertilizers akin to mineral supplements or energy nutrients aimed at promoting the proliferation of select microbes in the invisible organ. Synbiotics is a combination of both probiotics and prebiotics in a proper dosage aimed at remedying dysbiosis. The molecular understanding of dysbiosis and rebiosis will offer a very effective non-invasive means in preventing and curing diseases with probiotics and prebiotics. This will have a dramatic impact on our well-being.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
