As in animal viruses, the −1 ribosomal frameshift site in the viral mRNA consists of a canonical shifty heptanucleotide followed by a highly structured frameshift stimulatory element, and the gene translated as a result of frameshifting usually encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In plant viruses, the −1 frameshift stimulatory element consists of either (i) a small pseudoknot stabilized by many triple-stranded regions and a triple base pair containing a protonated cytidine at the helical junction, (ii) an unusual apical loop–internal loop interaction in which a stem-loop in the 3(′) untranslated region 4 kb downstream base pairs to a bulged stem-loop at the frameshift site, or (iii) a potential simple stem-loop. Other less well-characterized changes in reading frame occur on plant viral RNAs, including a possible +1 frameshift, and net −1 reading frame changes that do not utilize canonical frameshift signals. All these studies reveal the remarkable ways in which plant viral RNAs interact with ribosomes to precisely control protein expression at the ratios needed to sustain virus replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
