In the last decade, as a consequence of the extraordinary large RNA genome, novel recombinant variants of CCoV have been found that are closely related to feline and porcine strains. Moreover highly virulent pantropic CCoV strains were recently identified in dogs. The molecular characterization of the CCoV circulating in canine population is essential for understanding viral evolution.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
