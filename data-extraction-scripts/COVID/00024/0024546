Many viruses cause self-limiting and relatively mild infections, but several, including human immunodeficiency virus and influenza virus, are responsible for millions of deaths every year throughout the world. Several factors contribute to the enormous impact that viruses have on human health. For example, there are very few therapeutic options available for the treatment of viral infections, and many of those that are available possess a limited spectrum of activity or are designed for the treatment of diseases caused by specific viruses (e.g., oseltamivir is intended for the treatment of influenza only). In addition, the rapid evolution of viruses has led to the emergence of drug-resistant strains against which no currently available therapeutics are effective. Coupled with these and other issues are the appearance of never before seen viruses and the emergence of known but previously underappreciated viruses. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, numerous “new” viruses, including the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus, and Lujo hemorrhagic fever virus, have made their debut and have proved to be formidable threats to human health. Recently, the appearance of Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus) in West Africa, a region that has not previously seen an outbreak of this virus, was marked by an epidemic that afflicted nearly 30,000 individuals and killed more than 11,000 of those who were infected. Most recently, the far-reaching and rapid spread of Zika virus, a mosquito-borne virus that was discovered in the 1940s in Uganda, in the Western Hemisphere has invoked considerable public and scientific attention and has given rise to perhaps the largest concerted effort by scientists to rapidly develop a vaccine to halt the transmission of a virus. Each of these points underscores the importance of further research into improved surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of viral diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
