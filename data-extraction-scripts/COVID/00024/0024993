<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-07-02</DATELINE><TITLE>The Emergence of Zoonotic Pathogens as Agents of Concern in Transfusion Medicine</TITLE><BODY>A variety of emerging infections are of interest to transfusion medicine clinicians, but zoonotic pathogens, those maintained in nonhuman hosts and transmitted to humans, have dominated recent discussions, especially emerging acute viral infections that can or might spread around a shrinking globe with unprecedented speed, in an infected human or an infected vector or reservoir host. Further, advanced pathogen discovery techniques (e.g., metagenomics) allow the identification of potential pathogens before their recognition as clinically relevant to transfusion medicine. In the aftermath of our experiences with HIV and posttransfusion hepatitis, our windows for response to such agents and infections have contracted rapidly. These characteristics pose difficult challenges for our development of surveillance and control regimes capable of timely, but appropriately nuanced, responses. This monograph surveys a selection of such agents, exploring their apparent relevance to transfusion medicine, closing with a framework for an ongoing approach to their surveillance, recognition, threat evaluation, and mitigation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
