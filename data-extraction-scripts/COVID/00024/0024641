<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-07-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Biocontainment Principles for Pediatric Patients</TITLE><BODY>The need for medical communities to prepare for highly hazardous communicable disease outbreaks was perhaps best exemplified in the 2014–2016 Ebola virus outbreak. To date, most efforts of preparedness have focused on adult medical providers, though it is critical that pediatric institutions achieve the same level of preparedness for children who may present with these illnesses. Care of pediatric patients exposed and/or infected with these unique pathogens requires advanced planning and training in order to offer the highest level of care while at the same time being able to ensure the safety of both the hospital staff and the community. In this chapter, we will discuss the basic principles of biocontainment and care in a unique pediatric setting and offer guidelines on how to navigate the identification, isolation, family-centered care, and clinical care of children with highly hazardous communicable diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
