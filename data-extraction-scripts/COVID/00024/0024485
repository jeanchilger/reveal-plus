<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-06-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Healthcare-Associated Infections in Pediatric Hematology-Oncology</TITLE><BODY>Pediatric hematology-oncology and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients are at high risk of infections, including healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), resulting in a need to prevent these occurrences when possible. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), and respiratory viral infections are of particular concern, and the incidence, definition, and other features are reviewed. Currently, standard prevention guidelines exist for selected HAIs, and so the prevention approach for each infection must be considered separately. Prevention strategies have emerged through collaborative efforts, as well as measurement of both process and outcome data. Measurement includes surveillance of infection occurrence; identification and reporting of prevention methods, such as bundles; and the outcomes associated with these approaches. These prevention and measurement approaches are only successful when approached collaboratively with engagement across the entire healthcare team. Through continued measurement and process improvement based on the data collected, more sustainable approaches to infection prevention can be developed. With systematic effort, the occurrence of HAI should be reduced, and patient harm will be prevented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
