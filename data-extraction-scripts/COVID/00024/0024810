In the last few decades, increasing concerns about unfavorable outcomes associated with ABT, anticipation of future insufficient blood supply, and awareness of the cost (direct and indirect) of transfusion have led to the promotion of patient blood management (PBM) as a cost-effective strategy, beneficial for patients as well as for society (Shander et al. 2010). PBM programs utilize a series of measures with a proven ability to reduce ABT and to be cost-effective. Despite that the impact of PBM on patient clinical outcomes needs to be fully defined and future studies are needed, PBM should be adopted as a new standard of care.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
