<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-11-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Low-cost Paper Analytical Devices for Environmental and Biomedical Sensing Applications</TITLE><BODY>Over the last decade, the fabrication of analytical devices utilizing microfluidic structures and lab-on-a-chip platforms has shown breakthrough advancements, both for environmental and biological applications. The ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, robust, equipment-free, delivered), developed by the WHO for diagnostics devices, point towards the need of paper-based analytical devices (PAD) for diagnostics. On the other hand, cost-effective PADs owing the great advantage of affordable applicability in both resource-rich and -limited settings are recently employed for on-site environmental monitoring. In this book chapter, we will discuss about the brief history of paper analytical devices, fabrications, need, and its environmental and biomedical applications.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
