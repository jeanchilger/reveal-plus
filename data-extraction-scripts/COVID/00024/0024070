The importance of the legendary work of the Dartmouth Health Care Atlas Project and its founder Jack Wennberg. In areas where high GIS adoption rates occurred, such as in public health, we feature key applications such as immunization management, disease tracking, outbreak analysis, disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, emergency preparedness and response, community health assessment, environmental health, chronic disease prevention, and animal and veterinary health. The final Sect. 29.5 describes how GIS education has expanded across the academic fields of public health, healthcare administration, and social services.
