<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-03-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Phyllospheric Microbiomes: Diversity, Ecological Significance, and Biotechnological Applications</TITLE><BODY>The phyllosphere referred to the total aerial plant surfaces (above-ground portions), as habitat for microorganisms. Microorganisms establish compositionally complex communities on the leaf surface. The microbiome of phyllosphere is rich in diversity of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, and viruses. The diversity, dispersal, and community development on the leaf surface are based on the physiochemistry, environment, and also the immunity of the host plant. A colonization process is an important event where both the microbe and the host plant have been benefited. Microbes commonly established either epiphytic or endophytic mode of life cycle on phyllosphere environment, which helps the host plant and functional communication with the surrounding environment. To the scientific advancement, several molecular techniques like metagenomics and metaproteomics have been used to study and understand the physiology and functional relationship of microbes to the host and its environment. Based on the available information, this chapter describes the basic understanding of microbiome in leaf structure and physiology, microbial interactions, especially bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes, and their adaptation in the phyllosphere environment. Further, the detailed information related to the importance of the microbiome in phyllosphere to the host plant and their environment has been analyzed. Besides, biopotentials of the phyllosphere microbiome have been reviewed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
