However, such important immune functions are known to decline with age in many mammals, including humans. It is a matter of clinical importance that the incidence of various age-associated diseases such as infections, cancer, and vascular disorders increases with a decrease in immunological vigor. The extent of immunologic decline is variable and exhibits wide interindividual variations. Thus, it is important to assess the extent of immunologic decline in both patients suffering from various diseases and in healthy people in order to maintain healthy conditions. To this end, we have developed a scoring system that analyzes immune parameters according to a database of known age-associated immune changes obtained from a healthy population. Using this scoring system, we can combine several different immunological parameters and express the immune status of individuals as a simple numeral. Several methods of immunological restoration were introduced and the magnitude of restoration was evaluated by the quantitative assessment of immunological level.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
