On one hand, since they can disrupt standard genetic readout, they are avoided within the coding regions of most genes. On the other hand, they play important regulatory roles for the expression of those genes where they do occur. As a result, they are preserved among homologs and exhibit deep phylogenetic conservation. The combination of these two constraints results in a characteristic distribution of recoding sequences across genomes: they are highly conserved at specific locations while they are very rare in other locations. We term such sequences singular genomic elements to signify their rare occurrence and biological importance.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
