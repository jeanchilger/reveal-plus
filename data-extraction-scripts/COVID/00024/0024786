In general, plant antimicrobials exhibit greater antiviral efficacy against enveloped viruses than non-enveloped viruses (though not in all cases). There appear to be multiple mechanisms of antiviral action for plant antimicrobials; nevertheless, the majority of antimicrobials appear to act either directly on the virus itself (e.g., on the envelope or capsid) or during the early stages of virus replication following internalization of the virus into its host cell.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
