<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-08-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Infections</TITLE><BODY>Lower respiratory tract infection is a very common illness in children and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific especially in infants and younger children and some even present with nonrespiratory complaints. Infectious agents causing pneumonia is not limited to viruses and bacteria, but it could also be due to Mycoplasma, Mycobacteria, fungi, protozoa, and parasites. Coinfection with two or more microbial agents can also occur. The etiologic agent of lower respiratory infection in a child is often difficult to obtain, but the patient’s age can help narrow the possible cause. Microbiological tests are important but could be difficult to obtain especially in younger children. Various medical imaging modalities not only play an important role as an aid in diagnosis but can also help during and after therapy. Imaging can also help evaluate complications to pneumonia and exclude other causes of respiratory distress including underlying developmental anomalies, foreign body, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and aspiration. In this chapter, the imaging modalities utilized in the detection of pulmonary infections will be discussed. The spectrum of typical imaging findings for various etiologic agents in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised children will be presented.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
