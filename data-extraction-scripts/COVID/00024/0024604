<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-11-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Genus: Calanthe to Cyrtosia</TITLE><BODY>This large chapter describe the herbal usage and pharmacology of 73 species in 12 genera (Calanthe, Callostylis, Cephalanthera, Cleisostoma, Coelogyne, Conchidium, Corymborkhis, Cremastra, Crepidium, Cymbidium, Cypripedium and Cyrtosia). A good percentage of the orchids are commonly cultivated as ornamental plants and many hybrids have been produced with Calanthe and Cymbidium. TCM makes use of 14 species of Calanthe and Rumphius who authored Hut Amboinesche Kruidboek [the Amboinese Herbal, Volumes 1–6 (1741–1750), published posthumously] described Calanthe triplicata. Calanthe species contain compounds with antitumour and hair-restoring properties. Fourteen species of Coelogyne are medicinal and several have been studied phytochemically by Majumder’s group in Calcutta. Another large group, Cymbidium, with 17 medicinal species, is also much studied. Lectins present in some species suppress replication of coronaviruses, toroviruses and viruses. An interesting compound that suppresses angiogenesis has been discovered in Cremastra appendiculata and it may find a role in preventing blindness and spread of cancers. Cyrtosia is a homomycotrophic genus and should be an interesting subject for phytochemical studies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
