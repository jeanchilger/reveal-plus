<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-02-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Anti-infective Compounds from Marine Organisms</TITLE><BODY>The marine environment is a prolific source of bioactive compounds. During the last decades, research on marine-derived plants, animals, and microbes has provided an impressive number of structurally diverse anti-infective agents with antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, or antiviral activities. Moreover, several of these compounds possess novel mechanisms of action, which underlines their potential as leads in drug discovery. The present chapter provides an overview on marine-derived anti-infective agents, covering the literature between 2010 and 2016, with special focus on their structural features and mechanisms of action.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
