<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-05-19</DATELINE><TITLE>Bacterial Infections</TITLE><BODY>Molecular techniques have revolutionized the detection and identification of microorganisms. Real-time PCR has allowed for the rapid and accurate detection of MRSA, VRE, and group B Streptococcus. The identification of difficult and slow-growing organisms has been expedited by sequence-based methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Rapid identification of organisms and detection of resistance markers directly from positive blood culture bottles has become a reality. Finally, a transformation is taking place with the introduction of MALDI-TOF into clinical laboratories that promises to improve the accuracy and speed of bacterial and fungal identifications by days. The advantages of these methodologies and their associated clinical applications, along with their inherent pitfalls and problems, are elucidated in this chapter.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
