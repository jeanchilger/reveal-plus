<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-02-17</DATELINE><TITLE>The Impact of Movement on Disease Dynamics in a Multi-city Compartmental Model Including Residency Patch</TITLE><BODY>The impact of population dispersal between two cities on the spread of a disease is investigated analytically. A general SIRS model is presented that tracks the place of residence of individuals, allowing for different movement rates of local residents and visitors in a city. Provided the basic reproduction number is greater than one, we demonstrate in our model that increasing the travel volumes of some infected groups may result in the extinction of a disease, even though the disease cannot be eliminated in each city when the cities are isolated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
