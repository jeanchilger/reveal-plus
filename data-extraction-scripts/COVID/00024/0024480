In EAE, local apoptosis of autoimmune T-cells has been identified as a safe means for the removal of these unwanted cells. T-cell apoptosis in situ followed by phagocytic clearance of apoptotic remnants by glia assures a minimum of detrimental bystander damage to the local parenchyma and down-regulates the local inflammatory reaction. The pharmacological augmentation of local apoptosis of inflammatory effector cells might gain therapeutic importance also in human neuroimmunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
