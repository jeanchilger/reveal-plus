<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-08-22</DATELINE><TITLE>Saponin Synthesis and Function</TITLE><BODY>Saponins are one of the most numerous and diverse groups of plant natural products. They serve a range of ecological roles including plant defence against disease and herbivores and possibly as allelopathic agents in competitive interactions between plants. Some saponins are also important pharmaceuticals, and the underexplored biodiversity of plant saponins is likely to prove to be a vital resource for future drug discovery. The biological activity of saponins is normally attributed to the amphipathic properties of these molecules, which consist of a hydrophobic triterpene or sterol backbone and a hydrophilic carbohydrate chain, although some saponins are known to have potent biological activities that are dependent on other aspects of their structure. This chapter will focus on the biological activity and the synthesis of some of the best-studied examples of plant saponins and on recent developments in the identification of the genes and enzymes responsible for saponin synthesis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
