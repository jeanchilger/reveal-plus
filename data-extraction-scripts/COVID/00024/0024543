<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-04-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Virus-Induced Demyelination: The Case for Virus(es) in Multiple Sclerosis</TITLE><BODY>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease of man with over 400,000 cases in the United States and over 2.5 million cases worldwide. There are over 64,000 citations in Pubmed dating back as far as 1887. Much has been learned over the past 129 years with a recent burst in therapeutic options (mostly anti-inflammatory) with newer medications in development that are neuroprotective and/or neuroreparative. However, with all these advancements the cause of MS remains elusive. There is a clear interplay of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors that influences both the development and progression of this disorder. This chapter will give a brief overview of the history and pathogenesis of MS with attention to how host immune responses in genetically susceptible individuals contribute to the MS disease process. In addition, we will explore the role of infectious agents in MS as potential “triggers” of disease. Models of virus-induced demyelination will be discussed, with an emphasis on the recent interest in human herpesviruses and the role they may play in MS disease pathogenesis. Although we remain circumspect as to the role of any microbial pathogen in MS, we suggest that only through well-controlled serological, cellular immune, molecular, and animal studies we will be able to identify candidate agents. Ultimately, clinical interventional trials that either target a specific pathogen or class of pathogens will be required to make definitive links between the suspected agent and MS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
