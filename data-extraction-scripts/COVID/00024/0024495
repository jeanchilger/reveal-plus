<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-06-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Medical Course and Complications After Lung Transplantation</TITLE><BODY>Lung transplant prolongs life and improves quality of life in patients with end-stage lung disease. However, survival of lung transplant recipients is shorter compared to patients with other solid organ transplants, due to many unique features of the lung allograft. Patients can develop a multitude of noninfectious (e.g., primary graft dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, rejection, acute and chronic, renal insufficiency, malignancies) and infectious (i.e., bacterial, fungal, and viral) complications and require complex multidisciplinary care. This chapter discusses medical course and complications that patients might experience after lung transplantation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
