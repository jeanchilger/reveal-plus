<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-09-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Preparedness</TITLE><BODY>The 2014–2016 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa marked the 25th such occurrence but was noteworthy in its massive scope, causing more human morbidity and mortality than the previous 24 recorded outbreaks combined. As of April 2016, there were 28,652 cases resulting in at least 11,325 deaths, nearly all in the three nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html. Accessed 2 June 2016). Moreover, the 2014–2016 outbreak was the first in which patients, albeit few in number, were afforded sophisticated intensive care in the United States and in Europe. This “high-level containment care” (HLCC) was provided in specially designed purpose-built biocontainment units (BCUs). In this chapter, we explore the history and evolution of biocontainment, discuss its unique engineering and infection control modalities, and offer recommendations for the clinical and operational management of Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
