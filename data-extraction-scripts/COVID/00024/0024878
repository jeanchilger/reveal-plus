<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-11-10</DATELINE><TITLE>Nucleic Acid Extraction and Enrichment</TITLE><BODY>Nucleic acid extraction is the first step of any amplification experiment no matter what kind of amplification is used to detect a specific pathogen. Efficient nucleic acid extraction is essential to obtain good results using any molecular test. The optimal extraction method should fulfill the following conditions: speed, short working time, cost-effectiveness, high sensitivity and specificity, good reproducibility, and safety. The methods can be divided into solution or column based according to differences of their principles. The automated extraction instruments have many advantages, and these have proven to be very useful. Moreover, in recent years, fully automated instruments combining NA extraction and amplification have been commercially available. However, the method itself does not provide assurance, and the DNA recovery can be different among various kits or instruments that use the similar principles. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the performance of any extraction method used in the clinical microbiology laboratory even though manufacturers may have reported good validation results with specific organisms.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
