<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-04-02</DATELINE><TITLE>Microbiology, Antimicrobial Susceptibility, and Antibiotic Treatment</TITLE><BODY>Acute otitis media (AOM) is among the largest drivers of antibiotic use in children. As such, it is critical to understand the microbiology of this condition in detail to best delineate which antibiotics are most appropriate to use for patients with AOM and under what circumstances. Importantly, bacteria and/or viruses can be detected in the middle ear fluid in up to 96 % of AOM cases. The bacteriology of the condition has dramatically changed since the advent of universal pneumococcal vaccination. This chapter examines in detail the changing microbiology of otitis media (OM), along with guidelines for most appropriate antibiotic usage.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
