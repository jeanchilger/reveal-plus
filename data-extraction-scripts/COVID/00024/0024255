Testing novel vaccine candidates in animal models is a critical step in the development of modern vaccines. Animal models are being used to assess the quality and quantity of the immune response, to identify the optimal route of delivery and formulation, to determine protection from infection and disease transmission, and to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the vaccine formulation. Animal models help to make the translation from basic research to clinical application, and they often allow prediction of the vaccine potential, which helps in predicting the financial risks for vaccine manufacturers. Choosing an appropriate animal model has become increasingly important for the field, as each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this review, the criteria for selecting the right animal model, the advantages and disadvantages of various animal models, as well as the future needs for animal models are being discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
