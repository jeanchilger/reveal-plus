<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-05-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Mers-CoV and Zika Virus</TITLE><BODY>Chapter 6 analyses the recent emergence of Mers-CoV and the spread of Zika virus around the globe. With a glace into the future, especially with regard to emerging infectious diseases (EID), it explores the most important indicators of such emergence and spread, asking which local, national, and international characteristics come to the fore to heighten or mitigate such threats. It further initially evaluates how these might interact with accelerators such as climate change and migration, exploring in particular the allocation of health rights and responsibilities across borders. Between the timelines of response and the anticipation of new outbreaks, the chapter offers some pointers on what decision-makers need to take into account to prepare for EIDs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
