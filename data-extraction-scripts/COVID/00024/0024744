<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-02-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Infection Prevention and Control Issues After Solid Organ Transplantation</TITLE><BODY>Infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. Consequently, infection prevention is an essential component of any organ transplant program. Given their frequent and often prolonged contact with the healthcare system, solid organ transplant recipients are at high risk for healthcare-associated infections, including those caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms. In this chapter we review several different healthcare-associated infections of importance to transplant recipients, including those caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal organisms. We also describe infection prevention and control strategies applicable to this patient population. These practices focus on clinical interventions and environmental controls designed to prevent the spread of potentially pathogenic organisms in the healthcare setting. We also describe post-exposure interventions applicable to solid organ transplant recipients exposed to potential pathogens in order to reduce their risk of subsequent infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
