<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005</DATELINE><TITLE>Coronavirus Receptors</TITLE><BODY>The major receptor for murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), is identified as a protein, cell-adhesion molecule 1 in the carcinoembryonic antigen family (CEACAM1), which is classified in the immunoglobulin superfamily. There are four CEACAM1 isoforms, with either four or two ectodomains, resulting from an alternative splicing mechanism. CEACAM1 is expressed on the epithelium and in endothelial cells of a variety of tissues and hemopoietic cells, and functions as a homophilic and heterophilic adhesion molecule. It is used as a receptor for some bacteria as well. The N terminal domain participates in mediating homophilic adhesion. This domain is also responsible for binding to the MHV spike (S) protein; the CC’ face protruding in this domain interacts with an N terminal region of the S protein composed of 330 amino acids (called S1N330). The binding of CEACAM1 with MHV S protein induces S protein conformational changes and converts fusion-negative S protein to a fusion-positive form. The allelic forms of CEACAM1 found among mouse strains are thought to be an important determinant for mouse susceptibility to MHV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
