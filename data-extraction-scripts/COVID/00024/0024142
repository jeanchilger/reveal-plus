<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>Fungal Vaccines and Vaccination: Problems and Perspectives</TITLE><BODY>Vaccines against human pathogenic fungi, a rather neglected medical need until few years ago, are now gaining steps in the public health priority scale. The awareness of the rising medical threat represented by the opportunistic fungal infections among the health care-associated infections, the advances in the knowledge of fungal pathogenicity and immune response and the extraordinary progress of biotechnology have generated enthusiasm and critical new tools for active and passive anti-fungal vaccination. The discovery that antibodies play a critical role for protection against fungal infection has greatly contributed to the advancements in this field, in recognition that almost all useful vaccines against viral and bacterial pathogens owe their protective efficacy to neutralizing, opsonizing or otherwise effective antibodies. Overall, there is more hope now than few years ago about the chances of generating and having approved by the regulatory authorities one or more antifungal vaccines, be active or passive, for use in humans in the next few years. In particular, the possibility of protecting against multiple opportunistic mycoses in immuno-depressed subjects with a single, well-defined glucan-conjugate vaccine eliciting directly anti-fungal antibodies may be an important step to achieve this public health goal&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
