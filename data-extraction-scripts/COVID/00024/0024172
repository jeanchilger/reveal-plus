<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-08-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Risk Assessment for Foodborne Viruses</TITLE><BODY>Risk is an inherent component of human existence, as is our creation of ways to avoid or minimize such risks. The formal process of assessing the likelihood and magnitude of risk, using that information to manage risk, and then communicating the process to others, forms the basis for risk analysis. This chapter provides an overview of the steps of risk analysis with a focus on risk assessment for foodborne viruses, particularly quantitative efforts that model and estimate the risks these viruses pose to human health. Most risk assessments in food and environmental virology performed in the last decade have focused on water, fresh produce, molluscan shellfish, and prepared foods. Recent examples of enteric virus risk modeling efforts are discussed in detail, as are several of the difficulties and intricacies of performing risk assessments for foodborne viruses compared to bacteria and other agents. This is a relatively new area of study, but one that will continue to grow as national and international agencies continue to adopt and require the methodology for food safety and the protection of human health.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
