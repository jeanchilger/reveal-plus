These viruses are more readily diagnosed due to improvements in sensitive molecular diagnostic methods. The epidemiology of RSV and hMPV is similarly becoming more readily appreciated in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients of all ages as well as solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, with lung transplant recipients having evidence of more frequent and severe complications related to these viruses. RSV and hMPV infection typically but not always present with upper respiratory signs and symptoms that progress to lower respiratory tract disease. Treatment options for RSV are limited, with aerosolized, intravenous, and oral ribavirin all studied in HSCT and lung transplant patients. No antiviral therapy for the treatment of hMPV is available, although ribavirin has shown some effectiveness in vitro. New antiviral agents including RSV fusion inhibitors and nucleoside analogs are being developed, with some under clinical evaluation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
