This presents considerable challenges to our health care system since advanced age is associated with a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases due to immune senescence. However, the mechanisms underlying age-associated dysregulated immunity are still incompletely understood. Advancement in our comprehension of mechanisms of immune senescence and development of interventions to improve health span requires animal models that closely recapitulate the physiological changes that occur with aging in humans. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are invaluable preclinical models to study the underlying causal mechanism of pathogenesis due to their outbred nature, high degree of genetic and physiological similarity to humans, and their susceptibility to human pathogens. In this chapter, we review NHP models available for biogerontology research, advantages and challenges they present, and advances they facilitated. Furthermore, we emphasize the utility of NHPs in characterizing immune senescence, evaluating interventions to reverse aging of the immune system, and development of vaccine strategies that are better suited for this vulnerable population.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
