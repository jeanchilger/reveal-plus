This chapter provides a broad overview of microbiology that is relevant to the practicing cytologist. Virology addresses the cytopathic effects caused by viruses and discusses many key infections. Bacteriology covers important bacterial causes of infection including those due to mycobacteria and filamentous bacteria. Mycology deals with common fungi as well as deep mycoses, particularly those caused by invasive and dimorphic fungal organisms. Parasitology highlights the protozoa, apicomplexans, and helminths likely to be seen in cytology samples. Algae are also briefly mentioned.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
