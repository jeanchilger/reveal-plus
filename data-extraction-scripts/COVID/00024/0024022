<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2015-03-24</DATELINE><TITLE>Healthy Cities: Old and New Solutions</TITLE><BODY>Cities have had historically higher mortality and morbidity rates than rural areas. These spiked dramatically after the Industrial Revolution, which led to the first health of cities movement that stimulated the adoption of new public health measures to improve the built-environment in the developed countries. Together with such additional factors as increasing prosperity, hygiene and especially medical advances, the old health disadvantages of cities was reversed. But a new set of medical challenges threatening to reverse previous progress has emerged. These include such problems as bacterial resistances to many of the drugs that reduced communicative diseases, to the effects of indoor living and aging, all of which require urgent attention. In addition, a review of the various health determinants that contribute to ill-health shows that since many of these factors are not within the prevue of current medical practice, they must be addressed if the health and well-being of people in cities are to be improved. A series of other problems that were previously overlooked are being tackled by the new Healthy Cities movement, such as the need for more political and citizen involvement in planning and delivering health care, better ways of promoting health rather than just curing ill-health with a new emphasis on wellness, as well as more effective measures to reduce the persistent pockets of ill-health in many cities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
