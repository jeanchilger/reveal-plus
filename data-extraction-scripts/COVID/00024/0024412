<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-05-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Guidelines for Health Organizations: European Perspectives and Experience in Pandemics</TITLE><BODY>In Europe, the rate of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) use in intensive care units (ICUs) is about 35 % for ventilated patients and higher (roughly 60 %) in respiratory ICUs or emergency departments. In North America, this form of ventilation is begun most often in emergency departments (EDs), most patients being transferred to the ICU or step-down units in hospitals with such facilities. This low rate of use in some hospitals is related to scarce knowledge on or experience with this technique, insufficient technical equipment, and inadequate funding. Despite these limitations, NIV is increasingly being used outside traditional and respiratory ICUs, including EDs, postsurgical recovery rooms, cardiology, neurology, and oncology wards, and palliative care units.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
