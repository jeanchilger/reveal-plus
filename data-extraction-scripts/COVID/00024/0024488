<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007</DATELINE><TITLE>Kawasaki Disease</TITLE><BODY>Kawasaki disease, or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, was first described in Japan in the late 1960s as an illness characterized by persistent fever, conjunctivitis, mucous membrane changes, acral erythema with desquamation, and cervical adenopathy, associated with coronary arteritis (1,2). While earlier descriptions of the disease were limited to Asia and Hawaii, the disease is now known to occur worldwide. The disease is primarily one of young children, with 85% of cases occurring in children under five years. It is uncommon in children less than 6 months. There have been some epidemiologic investigations linking Kawasaki disease to freshly cleaned carpets, humidifier use, and living near a body of water, but these associations have not been observed consistently (3).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
