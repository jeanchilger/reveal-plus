<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-11-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Diplomacy and Global Health Security</TITLE><BODY>This chapter discusses the concept of global health security, the key challenges it raises and the role of diplomacy in addressing them. It begins by outlining an expanded understanding of security, describing the concept of health security, including the dual aspects of societal health security and individual, or personal, health security. The political context is also described. Key issues in societal health security are then outlined, including significant threats and current responses. Threats covered include the emergence of infectious diseases that cross the species barrier from animals to humans, climate change, the deliberate use of disease-causing agents and the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Current approaches to addressing threats to societal health security are discussed, along with the role to be played by international affairs. The chapter then describes key issues in individual health security, including reliable access to medicines and other health-related products and services; and the politically and economically sensitive determinants of access. The chapter then discusses how to ensure stronger global health security in the future.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
