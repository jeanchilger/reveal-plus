<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-12-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Impacts and Challenges of Advanced Diagnostic Assays for Transplant Infectious Diseases</TITLE><BODY>The advanced technologies described in this chapter should allow for full inventories to be made of bacterial genes, their time- and place-dependent expression, and the resulting proteins as well as their outcome metabolites. The evolution of these molecular technologies will continue, not only in the microbial pathogens but also in the context of host-pathogen interactions targeting human genomics and transcriptomics. Their performance characteristics and limitations must be clearly understood by both laboratory personnel and clinicians to ensure proper utilization and interpretation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
