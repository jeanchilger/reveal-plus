The cause of the majority of vasculitides is unknown, although it is likely that a complex interaction between environmental factors, such as infections and inherited host responses, triggers the disease and determines the vasculitis phenotype. Several genetic polymorphisms in vasculitides have now been described, which may be relevant in terms of disease predisposition or development of disease complications. Treatment regimens continue to improve with the use of different immunosuppressive medications and newer therapeutic approaches such as biologic agents. This chapter reviews recent studies shedding light on the pathogenesis of vasculitis with emphasis on molecular biology where known, and summarizes current treatment strategies. We discuss new emerging challenges particularly with respect to the long-term cardiovascular morbidity for children with systemic vasculitis and emphasize the importance of future international multicenter collaborative studies to further increase and standardize the scientific base investigating and treating childhood vasculitis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
