In particular, the human intestine spans ca. 200 m(2) and represents a massive absorptive surface composed of a layer of epithelial cells as well as a paracellular barrier. The permeability of this paracellular barrier is regulated by transmembrane proteins known as claudins that play a critical role in tight junctions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
