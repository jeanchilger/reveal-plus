<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-11-26</DATELINE><TITLE>Vitamin D: Photobiological and Ecological Aspects</TITLE><BODY>Vitamin D was discovered as a result of its ability to cure rickets, but recently a wide range of other functions for it in the human body has been suggested. Vitamin D is not a vitamin in the strict sense as it can be synthesised in the human body following exposure of the skin to ultraviolet radiation. Provitamin D (7-dehydrocholesterol) is converted to previtamin D which is further modified by a series of reactions to the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This Chapter summarises the discovery of vitamin D and reviews the chemistry and photochemistry of its precursors, transformations and metabolites. The production of vitamin D in various human populations is described, and how to assess vitamin D status. The skeletal and non-skeletal effects of vitamin D are discussed, particularly its role in immunomodulation with consequences for protection against a variety of human diseases. The Chapter concludes with evolutionary aspects, the occurrence and role of vitamin D in the plant kingdom, biogeographical considerations, and the nonphotochemical production of vitamin D in certain plants.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
