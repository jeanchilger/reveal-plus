<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-10-13</DATELINE><TITLE>Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea</TITLE><BODY>Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) first appeared in England and Belgium in the 1970s. The etiological agent of the disease is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to Coronaviridae. The disease has spread globally and became an endemic disease in many Asian and European countries causing transient diarrhea in postweaning pigs with low mortalities for several decades. Since late 2010, field outbreaks of PED, which reemerged in China, spread to Asian and some European countries and emerged in North America; all led to enormous economic losses in porcine industry. New variants of PEDV exhibit not only significant genetic variations as compared to historic PEDV strains but also more virulent causing severe vomiting and watery yellowish diarrhea in suckling piglets under 1 week of age. Factors underlying the potential pathogenesis of the recent PEDV outbreaks include the mutation of the virus, the lacking of maternal antibodies for the protection of piglets, and the slower turnover rate of enterocytes (5–7 days) of the neonatal piglets as compared to postweaning pigs (2–3 days). The emerging and reemerging of the new variants of PEDV highlight the importance of reviewing the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and epidemiology of the disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
