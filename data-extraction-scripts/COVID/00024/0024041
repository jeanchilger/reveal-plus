<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-03-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Infectious Complications of Transplantation</TITLE><BODY>Post-transplant infection is a common cause of graft deterioration, morbidity and mortality. It is also responsible for delayed discharge, multiple, often prolonged admissions and thus a significant clinical challenge. Infections can be donor derived, pre-existing in the recipient, nosocomial and opportunistic. For each of these categories, it is often possible to significantly reduce hazard and thus the adverse consequences by first identifying patients at high risk. As always, clinical vigilance is vital, but equally important is the establishment of robust clinical systems for prevention, screening and rapid treatment.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
