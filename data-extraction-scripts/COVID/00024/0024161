<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006</DATELINE><TITLE>FIV as a Model for AIDS Vaccine Studies</TITLE><BODY>Many experimental strategies have been adopted in experiments to protect cats from FIV infection by vaccination, and some have been successful. The interest in developing a vaccine arose both because FIV is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in pet cats and because the feline virus provides a model for its counterpart in man, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for which an effective vaccine is urgently required to halt the current tragic pandemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Shortly after the discovery of FIV and its characterization as a lentivirus, attempts were made to produce a vaccine and success was soon achieved with relatively simple inactivated virus or inactivated virus-infected cell vaccines.82 Further development of this approach led to the introduction in 2002 of the first commercial vaccine against FIV.59 With an estimated prevalence of the infection of up to 25% in populations of pet cats, an effective FIV vaccine could have a significant influence on animal welfare. In addition, this success poses the question of whether a similar strategy might produce an effective vaccine against HIV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
