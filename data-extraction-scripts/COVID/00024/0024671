<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2017-05-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Reintroduction</TITLE><BODY>The introduction presents the concepts of health in relation to order, disorder, and re-ordering. It defines health and the right to health along with the concomitant responsibilities for its realization ascribed to nation-state and non-state actors. It discusses the remit of health security as the provision and protection of health rights through responsibilities at the local, national, and global levels of community and governance. Finally, it argues that health risks and threats cannot be completely eliminated, but rather must be identified and responded to in a coordinated manner involving individuals, communities, national states, international organizations, and the global (conceptual) community.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
