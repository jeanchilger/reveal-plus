These antibodies have been shown protect production and companion animals from a number of pathogens. This chapter reviews the immune system for the principles of immune response to antigens and the synthesis of immunoglobulins of the five classes of antibodies in the body. Colostrum antibodies are described for passive immunity protection in animals such as calves. Chicken egg antibodies are another source of antibodies for passive immunity. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are also used to provide passive immunity in the veterinary field.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
