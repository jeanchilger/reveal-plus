<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-02-15</DATELINE><TITLE>Rhinovirus, Coronavirus, Enterovirus, and Bocavirus After Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation or Solid Organ Transplantation</TITLE><BODY>Respiratory viral infections represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts. Newer molecular detection assays have allowed for the characterization of several respiratory viruses not previously recognized as having significant clinical impact in the immunocompromised population. Human rhinoviruses are the most common respiratory viruses detected in the upper respiratory tract of hematopoietic cell transplant and lung transplant recipients, and evidence on the impact on clinical outcomes is mounting. Other respiratory viruses including enteroviruses (EVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), and bocavirus may also contribute to pulmonary disease; however, data is limited in the immunocompromised population. Further studies are needed to define the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of these infections; this data will help inform decisions regarding development of antiviral therapy and infection prevention strategies.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
