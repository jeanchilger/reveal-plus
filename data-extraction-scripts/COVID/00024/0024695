Owing to their intrinsic physicochemical properties, carbohydrates are capable of generating structural diversity in a multitude of ways and are prominently displayed on the surfaces of cell membranes or on the exposed regions of macromolecules. Recent studies highlight that carbohydrate moieties are critical for molecular recognition, cell-cell interactions, and cell signaling in many physiological and pathological processes, and for biocommunication between microbes and host species. Modern carbohydrate microarrays emerged in 2002 and brought in new high-throughput tools for “glyco code” exploration. In this section, some basic concepts of sugar chain diversity, glyco-epitope recognition, and the evolving area of glyco-epitomics and biomarker discovery are discussed. Two complementary technologies, carbohydrate antigen arrays and photogenerated glyco-chips, serve as models to illustrate how to apply carbohydrate microarrays to address biomedical questions.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
