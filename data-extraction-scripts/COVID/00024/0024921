<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-10-13</DATELINE><TITLE>“Can’t Stop Coughing (But I Need to Get Back to the Shelter by 6)”</TITLE><BODY>In this chapter, we will explore a case involving an outbreak of tuberculosis that occurred among men living in a homeless shelter. The case delves into both the public health challenges involved in investigating a disease outbreak in a vulnerable population and the delicate balance of protecting individuals’ autonomy and confidentiality while protecting the public’s health. By the conclusion of the case, learners will be able to apply the socioecological model to tuberculosis, analyze an outbreak of disease using epidemiologic tools, and identify conflicts in balancing autonomy and justice while managing potential public health threats.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
