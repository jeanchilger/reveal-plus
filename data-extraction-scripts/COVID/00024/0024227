Indeed, there are many comorbidities and risk factors that predispose a patient to develop pediatric ARDS (PARDS) including, but not limited to, immunodeficiency, weight extremes, genetics, and environmental factors. These are particularly important to investigators because accurate prediction of which patients are at greatest risk of PARDS – both the development of PARDS and worse clinical outcomes after PARDS has been established – is key to identifying the next generation of diagnostic techniques and preventative strategies. In addition to those risk factors, there are specific disease processes that lead to the development of PARDS, often divided into direct or pulmonary insults and indirect or extrapulmonary insults. Finally, beyond the clinically visible risk factors, researchers are attempting to identify novel biomarkers to uncover hidden phenotypes of PARDS and enrich the prognostication and prediction of patient outcomes. This chapter delves into each of these concepts.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
