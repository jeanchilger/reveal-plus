<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2013-01-08</DATELINE><TITLE>The Lung and Its Transplantation and Artificial Replacement</TITLE><BODY>The human thoracic cavity houses a pair of lungs, the left lung and the right lung. The left lung is slightly smaller (since the heart is placed a bit to the left in the body) and has two lobes, and the right lung is bigger, with three lobes. They are spongy and elastic organs that are broad at the bottom and taper at the top. They consist of air sacs, the alveoli. Many alveoli group together and open into a common space. From this space arise the alveolar ducts, which join together to form bronchioles. The bronchioles connect them to the respiratory tract. The lungs also have blood vessels, the branches of the pulmonary artery and veins (Fig. 15.1).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
