<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-04-23</DATELINE><TITLE>The Nucleolus: Structure and Function</TITLE><BODY>The nucleolus is the largest nuclear organelle and is the primary site of ribosome subunit biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. It is assembled around arrays of ribosomal DNA genes, forming specific chromosomal features known as nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) which are the sites of ribosomal DNA transcription. While the nucleolus main activity involve different steps of ribosome biogenesis, the presence of proteins with no obvious relationship with ribosome subunit production suggests additional functions for the nucleolus, such as regulation of mitosis, cell cycle progression, stress response and biogenesis of multiple ribonucleoprotein complexes. The many novel factors and separate classes of proteins identified within the nucleolus support this view that the nucleolus may perform additional functions beyond its known role in ribosome subunit biogenesis. Here we review our knowledge of the nucleolar functions and will provide a detailed picture of how the nucleolus is involved in many cellular pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
