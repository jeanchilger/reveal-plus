For an understanding of the physical manifestations of BRI’s ‘final’ impression as espoused by Xi Jinping, the CPC Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC), the State Council and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the chapter focuses on the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB) undertaking, reviewing the narrative’s variations and modifications refined by successive Chinese leaders since 1994. It finally examines longitudinal SREB/MSR connectors in an empirical preview of BRI’s purposes and prospects.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
