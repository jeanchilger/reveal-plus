<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-02-17</DATELINE><TITLE>Vitamin D and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</TITLE><BODY>Vitamin D is an important regulator of calcium and bone homeostasis. It is also involved in the regulation of different genes and cellular functions, particularly in the context of inflammation, regeneration and immune control. Conversely, vitamin D deficiency which is often found in chronic, infectious and inflammatory diseases is thought to drive or enhance uncontrolled inflammation. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways most often because of cigarette smoking. It has been recognized that repetitive airway infections and systemic consequences or co-morbidities also contribute to the progressive nature of COPD. Vitamin D deficiency is known to sneak in from the early stages of COPD, to become highly prevalent at the more severe stages, and may thereby catalyse airway infection, inflammation and systemic consequences. Undoubtedly, vitamin D deficiency enhances bone resorption and osteoporosis in COPD for which appropriate vitamin D supplementation is recommended. However, conflicting evidence has emerged on the extra-calcemic effects of vitamin D in COPD. A recent intervention trial with high-dose supplementation in COPD was only able to reduce exacerbation frequency in the subgroup of patients with lowest baseline vitamin D levels. It confirms that severe vitamin D deficiency is a health hazard but that more clinical and experimental studies are needed to explore how vitamin D deficiency may affect airway biology and systemic effects in the context of smoke-induced lung diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
