<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2005</DATELINE><TITLE>Regulatory Aspects in the Development of Gene Therapies</TITLE><BODY>Preclinical therapeutics development research is directed toward fulfilling two overlapping sets of goals. A set of scientific goals includes defining the best molecule or biologic construct for the task at hand, and proving the case for its development. The second set of goals addresses regulatory requirements necessary to introduce the agent into human subjects. In the case of “small molecule” drugs, in most cases the identity of the molecule and appropriate safety studies are straightforward. In contrast, the development of biologic agents, including gene therapies discussed here, presents distinct challenges. The nature of the “drug” may be an organism subject to mutation or selection of variants through recombination. Its properties may vary depending on the scale and method of its preparation, purification, and storage. How to test adequately for its safety prior to first introduction in humans may not be straightforward owing to intrinsic differences in response to the agent expected in humans as compared to animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
