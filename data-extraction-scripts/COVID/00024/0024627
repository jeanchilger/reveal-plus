To recognize the importance to the maintenance of good health of adequate public health regulations and an infrastructure that provides clean water and appropriate waste management. 2. To see the lack of such amenities over many centuries, but the progressive development of public health bureaucracies dedicated to provision of an appropriate infrastructure for healthy cities, beginning during the Victorian Era. 3. To observe how responsibility for the provision of adequate housing for poorer city dwellers has been shared between government, benevolent entrepreneurs and charities. 4. To note the new challenges to public health presented by such current issues as the abuse of tobacco and mood-altering drugs, continuing toxic auto-emissions, the epidemic of HIV/AIDS, a decreased acceptance of MMR vaccinations, and the ready spread of infectious diseases by air travel.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
