<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-01-27</DATELINE><TITLE>Concerns and Threats of Contamination on Aquatic Ecosystems</TITLE><BODY>Aquatic ecosystems are the ultimate sinks for the contaminants. Water contamination is the outcome of human activities such as urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural activities. The overuse of pesticides and fertilizers and sewage from residential and industrial areas ultimately find its way to aquatic environment. Thus results in the degradation of the water quality and leads to the spread of infectious diseases such as dysentery, diarrhea, and jaundice. Contamination in aquatic environs is one of the leading types of pollution which has significant negative health issues and mortality. Water has a natural capacity to neutralize the contamination, but when contamination becomes uncontrolled, water will lose its self-generating capacity. Therefore, there is a need for regular monitoring and controlling of pollutant discharge into the nearby aquatic environs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
