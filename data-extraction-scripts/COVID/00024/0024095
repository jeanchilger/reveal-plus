<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Infections of the Lung</TITLE><BODY>The lungs are among the most vulnerable to microbial assault of all organs in the body. From a contemporary vantage, lower respiratory tract infections are the greatest cause of infection-related mortality in the United States, and rank seventh among all causes of deaths in the United States.2,3 From a global and historic perspective, the scope and scale of lower respiratory tract infection is greater than any other infectious syndrome, and viral pneumonias have proven to be some of the most lethal and dramatic of human diseases. The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic, perhaps the most devastating infectious disease pandemic in recorded history, resulted in an estimated 40 million deaths worldwide, including 700,000 deaths in the U.S.4 The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2003, although considerably smaller in scale, resulted in 8098 cases and 774 deaths5 and is a dramatic contemporary example of the ability of viral pneumonias to rapidly disseminate and cause severe disease in human populations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
