<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008-11-01</DATELINE><TITLE>Viral Helicases</TITLE><BODY>Helicases are motor proteins that use the free energy of NTP hydrolysis to catalyze the unwinding of duplex nucleic acids. Helicases participate in almost all processes involving nucleic acids. Their action is critical for replication, recombination, repair, transcription, translation, splicing, mRNA editing, chromatin remodeling, transport, and degradation (Matson and Kaiser-Rogers 1990; Matson et al. 1994; Mendonca et al. 1995; Luking et al. 1998).&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
