<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-02-23</DATELINE><TITLE>Emerging and Transboundary Animal Viral Diseases: Perspectives and Preparedness</TITLE><BODY>The epidemics and pandemics of a few infectious diseases during the past couple of decades have accentuated the significance of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) due to their influence on public health. Although Asia region has been identified as the epicentre of many EIDs and upcoming infections, several new pathogens have also emerged in the past in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A (H5N1), Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example threatening adversely both animal and public health globally. Infectious diseases are dynamic and concerning due to their epidemiology and aetiological agents, which is manifested within a host, pathogen and environment continuum involving domestic animals, wildlife and human populations. The complex relationship among host populations and other environmental factors creates conditions for the emergence of diseases. The factors driving the emergence of different emerging infectious disease (EID) interfaces include global travel, urbanisation and biomedical manipulations for human EIDs; agricultural intensification for domestic animal EIDs; translocation for wildlife EIDs; human encroachment, ex situ contact and ecological manipulation for wildlife–human EIDs; encroachment, new introductions and ‘spill-over’ and ‘spill-back’; and technology and industry for domestic animal–human EIDs. The concepts of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and biosecurity have gained recognition globally in almost all the realms of human activities, including livestock health and production management. This chapter provides the experience gained in the control and management of a few important TADs and EIDs along with the successes, constraints, limitations and future research needs for developing better control approaches.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
