<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-07-09</DATELINE><TITLE>Late Noninfectious Pulmonary Complications in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</TITLE><BODY>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established therapeutic modality for a number of malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Pulmonary complications following HSCT are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. These complications may be classified into infectious versus noninfectious, and early versus late based on the time of occurrence post-transplant. Thus, exclusion of infectious etiologies is the first step in the diagnoses of pulmonary complications. Late onset noninfectious pulmonary complications typically occur 3 months post-transplant. Bronchiolitis obliterans is the major contributor to late-onset pulmonary complications, and its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and current therapeutic approaches are discussed. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome is another important complication which usually occurs early, although its onset may be delayed. Organizing pneumonia is important to recognize due to its responsiveness to corticosteroids. Other late onset noninfectious pulmonary complications discussed here include pulmonary venoocclusive disease, pulmonary cytolytic thrombi, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis, thoracic air leak syndrome, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
