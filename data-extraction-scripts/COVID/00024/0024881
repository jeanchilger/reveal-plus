<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-06-07</DATELINE><TITLE>Simulation and Modeling Applications in Global Health Security</TITLE><BODY>Global health security (GHS) is dependent upon having an adequate and prepared health security workforce. There are currently numerous challenges in establishing and maintaining a health security workforce. The frequency and magnitude of disasters have increased significantly over the past 30 years. Current and future GHS threats, both manmade and natural, require a prepared and flexible healthcare provider workforce ready to respond to current or emerging GHS threats. Developing and maintaining GHS -specific skills in the healthcare workforce is a tremendous logistical challenge. Innovative education technologies, including simulation and digital learning, can be leveraged to achieve preparedness for GHS threats. This chapter focuses on the application of modeling and simulation to support Global Health Security planning, preparedness and operations.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
