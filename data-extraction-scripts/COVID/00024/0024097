One of the most studied systems is the N-linked glycosylation pathway in the synthesis of secreted glycoproteins (Schrag et al. 2003). The N-linked glycoproteins are subjected to diverse modifications and are transported through ER and Golgi apparatus to their final destinations in- and outside the cell. Incorporation of cargo glycoproteins into transport vesicles is mediated by transmembrane cargo receptors, which have been identified as intracellular lectins. For example, mannose 6-phosphate receptors (Ghosh et al. 2003) function as a cargo receptor for lysosomal proteins in the trans-Golgi network, whereas ERGIC-53 (Zhang et al. 2003) and its yeast orthologs Emp46/47p (Sato and Nakano 2002) are transport lectins for glycoproteins that are transported out of ER.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
