<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2008</DATELINE><TITLE>Disease Outbreaks Caused by Emerging Paramyxoviruses of Bat Origin</TITLE><BODY>Newly emerging and re-emerging infections are recognized as a global problem and 75% of these are potentially zoonotic (Woolhouse & Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). Emergence of a new “killer” disease in any part of the world is likely to be a threat world wide in today’s society with very rapid means of transportation of both human and animal/animal products. Recent examples include the global outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H5N1 avian influenza, and the outbreaks of West Nile virus in United States. The rapid economic development in the Asian region during the last few decades was accompanied by massive urbanization and environmental changes, which are believed to be one of the triggers leading to the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. Wildlife animals play an ever-increasing role in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, and bats have been identified as natural reservoir host of several lethal zoonotic viruses that emerged in recent times. This review will focus on the disease outbreaks caused by emerging bat viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
