<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2012-03-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Prevention of Infections in Patients with Hematological Malignancies</TITLE><BODY>Infection is a frequent complication and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. Problems associated with the management of infections in these patients include difficulties in early diagnosis because the clinical signs of infection are subtle, the low performance of diagnostic tests, and suboptimal response to treatment because recovery of host defenses is a key factor for resolution of infection. Preventing these infections relies on infection control measures and antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. While infection control measures are safe (but not always effective), the use of antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis of infection is not devoid of problems. Its wide use may increase the possibility of the development of resistance, select for resistant organisms, and increase toxicity and cost. Therefore, any attempt to administer an antimicrobial agent should be accompanied by a reflection of the potential benefits and risks of prophylaxis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
