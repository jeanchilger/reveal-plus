<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2018-05-08</DATELINE><TITLE>Pulmonary Hemorrhage, Transient Tachypnea, and Neonatal Pneumonia</TITLE><BODY>The intent of this chapter is to address three other common pulmonary causes of respiratory distress in the high-risk infant. These other forms of parenchymal lung disease range in severity from mild, as seen in transient tachypnea, to severe as is often the case in pulmonary hemorrhage. It is worth noting that on occasion, one or more of these conditions may coexist in the same patient. The treatment for all conditions is largely supportive or involves the use of targeted antimicrobial therapy.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
