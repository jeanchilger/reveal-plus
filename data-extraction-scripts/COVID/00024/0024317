<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2014-08-13</DATELINE><TITLE>Infectious Diseases</TITLE><BODY>Infectious disease agents include viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, parasites, and proteins called prions. Some patients are asymptomatic from their infection, whereas in other patients, clinical or subclinical illness affects the patient during the perioperative period. Transmission of the agents can occur through airborne inhalation, through contact with contaminated body fluids, via food, through physical contact, or through vector organisms. Additionally, patient-patient and patient-healthcare worker (HCW) transmission of infectious diseases remain a high concern. The perioperative period represents a unique challenge in the prevention of transmission. While diligent hand washing remains a staple in the standard of care, other measures must be implemented with certain infectious agents. Several of the major infectious diseases will be reviewed in this section, and universal precautions will be examined. Careful perioperative planning and situational awareness should be practiced by the healthcare worker taking care of patients with transmissible diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
