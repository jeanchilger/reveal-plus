<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-07-09</DATELINE><TITLE>What the Intensivist Needs to Know About Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation?</TITLE><BODY>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potential curative therapy for some patients with hematologic conditions. There are two main types of HSCT. This includes autologous HSCT, for which the stem cells are obtained from the patient, and allogeneic HSCT, for which the stem cells are obtained from a related or unrelated donor. The most common indications for autologous stem cell transplant are multiple myeloma and relapsed/refractory lymphoma, whereas leukemia and bone marrow failure syndromes remain the most common indications for allogeneic stem cell transplant. This chapter will review the different types, indications, processes, and main complications of HSCT. This chapter will also discuss end-of-life issues that patients and providers face when transplant patients are admitted for the intensive care unit.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
