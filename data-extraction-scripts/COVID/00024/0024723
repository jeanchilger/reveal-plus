<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-11-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Allografts in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</TITLE><BODY>Usual allograft sources for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are patellar ligament, Achilles tendon, tibialis anterior, and posterior. The advantages of the use of allograft include reduced donor-site morbidity, shorter operative time, smaller incisions, and no size restrictions. The disadvantages include increased cost, slower graft embodiment, and the risk of viral or bacterial infection, which may occur either by transmission from an infected donor or by contamination by the healthcare provider. Careful donor selection, aseptic graft procurement and processing, and tissue sterilization, by irradiation or proprietary chemical processing, are the three major steps of the graft preparation procedure. Successful allograft implantation depends on sterility, reduction of antigenicity, and preservation of the biomechanical properties of the graft. To date, reports on the clinical and functional outcomes of allograft compared to autograft ACL reconstruction are controversial. Overall, graft choice depends on surgeon and patient preference, since no graft can perfectly match the properties of the native ACL.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
