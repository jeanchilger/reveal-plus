Drinking water is one of the essential global life elements for humanity. However, some of our resources are contaminated with viruses and indicators for continuous monitoring have been developed. The classical ones are coliforms and fecal coliforms that are still the iron standard for water indicator monitoring (see Chap. 10.1007/978-94-017-9499-2_34). In the last decades, bacteriophages have been suggested as potential indicators of enteric viruses and many studies showed their potential as such mainly due to their comparable resistance to water processes such as disinfection. In this chapter, the indicator role of bacteriophages in water is critically reviewed and discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
