<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-06-18</DATELINE><TITLE>Influenza Virus: The Biology of a Changing Virus</TITLE><BODY>Influenza viruses are members of the family Orthomyxoviridae and include influenza virus types A, B, and C. This introduction provides an overview of influenza virus classification, structure, and life cycle. We also include a brief review of the clinical manifestations of influenza and the molecular determinants for virulence. The genetic diversity of influenza A viruses and their capability to successfully infect an array of hosts, including avian and mammalian species, are highlighted in a discussion about host range and evolution. The importance of viral receptor-binding hemagglutinins and host sialic acid distribution in species-restricted binding of viruses is underscored. Finally, recent advances in our understanding of the seasonality and transmission of influenza viruses are described, and their importance for the control of the spread of these viruses is discussed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
