Intrathecal administration of interleukin-1β and interferon-γ to rats results in a thermal hyperalgesia which peaks at 2 h post-injection but which is undetectable 8 h post-injection. Expression of mRNA for nitric oxide synthase type II (NOS II) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern hybridization utilizing specific oligonucleotides in spinal cord tissue from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection, but not at longer time points. NOS II protein was detected in soluble fractions of spinal cords from animals 4 h and 8 h after cytokine injection. In situ hybridization for NOS II mRNA revealed positive cells bilaterally in the spinal cord 4 h after cytokine injection in a perivascular distribution and scattered throughout the gray and white matter. Immunohistochemistry for NOS II showed a similar distribution which could only be partially accounted for by macrophages/microglia. These results provide evidence for induction of NOS II expression under conditions producing thermal hyperalgesia and suggest a possible role in this behavior for the production of NO by a variety of cell types in the CNS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
