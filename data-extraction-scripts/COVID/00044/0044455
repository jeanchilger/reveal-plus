It is shown here that following transection of the rat facial nerve there is strongly elevated expression of class I, and to a lesser extent, class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the facial nucleus. It is demonstrated by double-immunofluorescence studies that the cells responsible for increased levels of MHC class I antigens are endogenous brain microglia. These findings emphasize the thought that microglia are immunocompetent cells, but, at the same time, raise the possibility for a non-immubological function of MHC antigens under conditions of neural regeneration.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
