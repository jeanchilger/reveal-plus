Recent advancements in nanotechnological science and engineering advise that many of the waterborne pathogens could be culminated or debilitated using nanobiosorbents, nanocatalysts, bioactive nanoparticles, nanostructured catalytic membranes, nanobioreactors, nanoparticle-enhanced filtration among other products, and processes resulting from the development of nanotechnology. A detailed insight has been provided for advanced techniques such as photochemical (photocatalytic and advanced oxidation processes) applications of metal oxide nanoparticles, nanomembrane technology, bioinspired nanomaterials, and nanotechnological innovations (nano-Ag, fullerenes, nanotubes, and molecularly imprinted polymers, etc.), which prove to be highly potential as well as promising and cost-effective. However, there are still some shortcomings and challenges that must be overcome which will be looked upon in this chapter.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
