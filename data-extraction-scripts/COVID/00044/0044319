In this study, we have used the fusogenic core as a scaffold to design HIV-1 fusion inhibitory proteins by linking another HR1 to the C terminus of HR1–HR2 (HR121) or additional HR2 to the N terminus of HR1–HR2 (HR212). Both recombinant proteins could be abundantly and solubly expressed and easily purified, exhibiting high stability and potent inhibitory activity on HIV-1 fusion with IC50 values of 16.2±2.8 and 2.8±0.63nM, respectively. These suggest that these rationally designed proteins can be further developed as novel anti-HIV-1 therapeutics.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
