To understand pathogenicity of a virus it is important to gain knowledge on the function of the individual viral proteins in the host cell, on their interactions with viral and cellular proteins and on the consequences of these interactions on cellular signaling pathways. A combination of transcriptomics, proteomics, high-throughput technologies and the bioinformatical analysis of the respective data help to elucidate specific cellular antiviral drug target candidates. In addition, viral and human interactome analyses indicate that different viruses target common, central human proteins for entering cellular signaling pathways and machineries which might constitute powerful broad-spectrum antiviral targets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
