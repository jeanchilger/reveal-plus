The filter cloth was prepared by depositing nanosize ceramic hydroxyapatite on a cotton fabric. The porous ceramic with pore size of several micrometers or less was fabricated by using water soluble starch as a pore former, and its permeability was controlled by adding insoluble starch. Bacterial filtration tests showed that the six-layer filter cloth can clear bacteria effectively, and the porous ceramic can remove 100% of the bacteria. Both the filter cloth and the porous ceramic can be used to clear or separate microbes.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
