However, as a result of the phenomenon of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), there is an increasing need to seek beneficial pharmacological therapies for ARDS. Recent studies have suggested the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which consists of the ACE/Ang-II/AT1R axis and ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MasR axis, plays a dual role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and VILI. This review highlights the deleterious action of ACE/Ang-II/AT1R axis and the beneficial role of ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/MasR axis, as well as AT2R, in VILI and ARDS, and also discusses the possibility of targeting RAS components with pharmacological interventions to improve outcomes in ARDS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
