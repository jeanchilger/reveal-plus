Seroprevalence data is needed to better understand the epidemiology of ECoV in adult horses, evaluate diagnostic modalities and develop preventive measures. The objective of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence and selective risk factors for ECoV in 5247 healthy adult horses in the USA, using a recently established and validated IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Prevalence factors analysed in this study included geographic region, age, breed, sex and use. A total of 504/5247 horses (9.6%) horses tested seropositive. Geographic region (Mid-West; P = 0.008), breed (Draft horses; P = 0.003) and specific uses of horses (ranch/farm, P = 0.034; breeding use, P = 0.016) were all statistically significant risk factors for seropositivity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
