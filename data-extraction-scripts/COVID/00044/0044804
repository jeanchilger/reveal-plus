Spike (S) proteins are present on the surface of MERS-CoV virions and mediate viral entry. S is the primary target for MERS-CoV vaccine and antibody development, and it has become increasingly important to understand MERS-CoV antibody binding specificity and function. Commonly used serological methods like ELISA, biolayer interferometry, and flow cytometry are informative, but limited. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput protein binding inhibition assay using image cytometry. The image cytometry-based high-throughput screening method was developed by selecting a cell type with high DPP4 expression and defining optimal seeding density and protein binding conditions. The ability of monoclonal antibodies to inhibit MERS-CoV S binding was then tested. Binding inhibition results were comparable with those described in previous literature for MERS-CoV spike monomer and showed similar patterns as neutralization results. The coefficient of variation (CV) of our cell-based assay was <10%. The proposed image cytometry method provides an efficient approach for characterizing potential therapeutic antibodies for combating MERS-CoV that compares favorably with current methods. The ability to rapidly determine direct antibody binding to host cells in a high-throughput manner can be applied to study other pathogen-antibody interactions and thus can impact future research on viral pathogens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
