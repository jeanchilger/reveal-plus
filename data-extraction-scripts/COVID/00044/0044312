Estimates of risk reductions and associated operational costs of both HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation are modeled and compared using a case study of airborne transmission of influenza in a hypothetical office space. Overall, recirculating HVAC filtration was predicted to achieve risk reductions at lower costs of operation than equivalent levels of outdoor air ventilation, particularly for MERV 13–16 filters. Medium efficiency filtration products (MERV 7–11) are also inexpensive to operate but appear less effective in reducing infectious disease risks.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
