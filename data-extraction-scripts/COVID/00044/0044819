<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2020-12-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Liver Disease Associated with Non-Hepatitis Viruses</TITLE><BODY>Abstract Hepatitis is commonly associated with certain viruses labeled as “Hepatitis” viruses. However, many other viral infections can also affect the liver ranging from mild asymptomatic elevations of aminotransferases to fulminant hepatic failure. This article will provide a brief overview on a variety of different viral infections that may be associated with significant liver pathology at least under certain conditions, for example, immunosuppression. This overview discusses key virological features, clinical presentation of associated liver disease and provides some information on diagnosis and an outline of treatment options. Thus, the overview can provide first orientation when infectious hepatitis is encountered in a patient that cannot be explained by the usual hepatitis viruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
