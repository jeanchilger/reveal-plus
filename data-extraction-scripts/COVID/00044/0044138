OBJECTIVE: To study whether RSV or RV types are differentially associated with the future use of asthma control medication. METHODS: Over 2 consecutive winter seasons (2008-2010), we enrolled 408 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis at age less than 24 months into a prospective, 3-center, 4-year follow-up study in Finland. Virus detection was performed by real-time reverse transcription PCR from nasal wash samples. Four years later, we examined current use of asthma control medication. RESULTS: A total of 349 (86%) children completed the 4-year follow-up. At study entry, the median age was 7.5 months, and 42% had RSV, 29% RV, 2% both RSV and RV, and 27% non-RSV/-RV etiology. The children with RV-A (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.3; P = .01), RV-C (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.5; P < .001), and non-RSV/-RV (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.0; P = .004) bronchiolitis started the asthma control medication earlier than did children with RSV bronchiolitis. Four years later, 27% of patients used asthma control medication; both RV-A (adjusted odds ratio, 3.0; P = .03) and RV-C (adjusted odds ratio, 3.7; P < .001) etiology were associated with the current use of asthma medication. The highest risk was found among patients with RV-C, atopic dermatitis, and fever (adjusted odds ratio, 5.0; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Severe bronchiolitis caused by RV-A and RV-C was associated with earlier initiation and prolonged use of asthma control medication. The risk was especially high when bronchiolitis was associated with RV-C, atopic dermatitis, and fever.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
