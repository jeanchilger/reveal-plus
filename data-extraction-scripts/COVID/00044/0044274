Therefore, a simple, rapid, and safe method to investigate a therapeutic approach against these pathogens is required. In this study, a simple, quick, and safe cell adhesion inhibition assay was developed to determine the potential cellular binding site on the SARS-CoV spike protein. Various synthetic peptides covering the potential binding site helped to minimize further the binding motif to 10–25 residues. Following analyses, 2 peptides spanning the 436–445 and 437–461 amino acids of the spike protein were identified as peptide inhibitor or peptide vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
