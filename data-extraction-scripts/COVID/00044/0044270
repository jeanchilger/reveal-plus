To assess the efficacy and safety of a low-dose recombinant human interferon α-2b (rIFNα-2b) nasal spray in preventing acute viral respiratory infections in military population, we performed this randomized controlled trial. The results showed that application of the rIFNα-2b nasal spray had the benefits in prevention of infections caused by influenza A virus, influenza B virus parainfluenza viruses 1–3 and adenovirus species B. However, no benefit was seen in preventing respiratory syncytial virus. No severe adverse events were reported. Therefore, the rIFNα-2b nasal spray was effective and well tolerated for preventing common viral respiratory infections in the military recruits.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
