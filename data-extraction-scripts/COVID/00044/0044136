Diagnosis of etiologic agents causing enteritis is important when considering herd implications and zoonotic potential of some etiologies. Differential diagnoses for enteritis in adult ruminants is not simple based on clinical signs alone. Diagnostic samples include feces, blood, and antemortem and postmortem tissues. Treatment of infectious enteritis is aimed at correcting dehydration and electrolyte imbalances secondary to diarrhea. In cases of some bacterial and parasitic pathogens, additional targeted treatment and control are recommended. Management of enteritis may be instituted while awaiting laboratory test results.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
