Nevertheless, there are striking resemblances among the viruses in the organization and expression of their genomes, and sequence conservation among the polymerase polyproteins strongly suggests that they have a common ancestry. On this basis, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses recently established a new order, Nidovirales, to contain the two families. Here, the common traits and distinguishing features of the Nidovirales are reviewed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
