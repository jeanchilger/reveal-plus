The proteomic patterns were identified; the tree model of biomarkers was constructed and evaluated using the Biomarker Patterns Software. The model tree was constructed based on the 3 biomarkers (5913 Da, 6181 Da and 13,752 Da), which generated excellent separation between the gallbladder cancer and control groups. The sensitivity was 86.7% and the specificity was 93.3%. The blind test data showed a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%. Taken together, our studies suggested that biomarkers for gallbladder cancer could be discovered in serum by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with the use of magnetic beads. The pattern of combined markers would provide a powerful and reliable diagnostic method for gallbladder cancer with high sensitivity and specificity.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
