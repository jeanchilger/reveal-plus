Six age-matched, FIV-infected cats used in this cross-over study were injected subcutaneously with 5μg/kg of rHuG-CSF daily for 3 weeks, while six control cats received a placebo. Five of six rHuG-CSF-treated cats had significant increases in neutrophil counts that peaked on days 11–21 of treatment. All rHuG-CSF-treated cats exhibited an increase in myeloid:erythroid ratios of the bone marrow cells without significant changes in lymphocyte, CD4 counts, CD4/CD8 ratios, RBC counts, FIV antibody titers, and FIV loads in peripheral blood, and without clinical and hematological toxicities. Five of six rHuG-CSF-treated cats developed antibodies to rHuG-CSF by 14–21 days of treatment, which correlated with decreasing neutrophil counts and increasing neutralizing antibodies to rHuG-CSF. Three cats re-treated with rHuG-CSF rapidly developed neutralizing antibodies to rHuG-CSF, while one cat also developed neutralizing antibodies to recombinant feline G-CSF (rFeG-CSF). Overall, rHuG-CSF treatment increased neutrophil counts in FIV-infected cats without affecting the infection status of cats. However, long-term use of rHuG-CSF is not recommended in cats because of the neutralizing antibody production to rHuG-CSF that affects the drug activity. In addition, a preliminary finding suggests that repeated treatment cycle can also induce cross-neutralizing antibodies to rFeG-CSF, which may potentially affect the homeostasis of endogenous FeG-CSF.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
