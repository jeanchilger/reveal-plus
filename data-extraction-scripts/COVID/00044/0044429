The results indicate that the urban labor market experienced a direct effect in terms of a reduction in employment of the group vulnerable to the epidemic while the rural labor market experienced an indirect effect on its economy through a reduction in employment resulting from a decline in consumption and leisure activities. If one looks into the employment in the accommodation and leisure industry, which sustained the most severe blow, dropped to its lowest level right after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. The rural leisure and accommodation industries are highly likely to be dependent on consumption and spending from urban areas. The results suggest that the rural labor market was influenced by the spillover/external effects caused by behavioral changes among people in urban areas due to fear of infection. Thus, this empirical analysis can be used to customize policy to support regions that can be negatively impacted by spillovers due to epidemic in order to respond against economic stresses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
