<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-07-05</DATELINE><TITLE>Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus of Pigs and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus</TITLE><BODY>TGEV and PEDV are porcine coronaviruses with typical coronavirus virion structures and replication cycles. Both viruses cause diarrhea in pigs with similar clinical symptoms. Disease severity is inversely related to the age of animals. While TGEV infections are currently under control, recent emergence of virulent PEDV strains results in significant mortality. No effective treatments are available once animals are infected. Detection of viral antigen and/or genomic RNA is required for diagnosis. Prevention measures include enhanced biosecurity and vaccination with the latter being the most effective approach. Commercial vaccines for both viruses are available and numerous experimental vaccines are in development.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
