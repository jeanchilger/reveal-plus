Positive selection was not detected and mutation rates ranged from 10−4 to 10−6 substitutions/site/year for Mass and Conn IBV types where attenuated live vaccines are routinely used to control the disease. In contrast, for CAL type viruses, for which no vaccine exists, positive selection was detected and mutation rates were 10 fold higher ranging from 10−2 to 10−3 substitutions/site/year. Lower levels of genetic diversity among the Mass and Conn viruses as well as sequence similarities with vaccine virus genomes suggest that the origin of the Mass and all but one of the Conn viruses was likely vaccine virus that had been circulating in the field for an unknown but apparently short period of time. The genetic data also identified a recombinant IBV isolate with 7 breakpoints distributed across the entire genome suggesting that viruses within the same serotype can have a high degree of genetic variability outside of the spike gene. These data are important because inaccurate measures of genetic diversity and mutation rates could lead to underestimates of the ability of IBV to change and potentially emerge to cause disease.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
