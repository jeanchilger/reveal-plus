This virus is a new member of the Parvoviridae family and has been classified in the Bocavirus genus. This virus named human bocavirus (HboV) is genetically related to the bovine parvovirus and the canine minus virus that belong to the Bocavirus genus. Recent studies conducted in different countries showed that this virus is found in 3 to 10 % of children with respiratory disease worldwide with no real seasonal distribution and that it is frequently associated with other respiratory pathogens. Genetic analysis indicated that this virus probably includes only one type. The clinical signs are not different from those caused by other respiratory viruses. The exact role played by this virus in human diseases needs to be further investigated.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
