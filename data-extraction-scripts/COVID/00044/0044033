Native E2 and tryptic subunits of the glycoprotein were separated by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Two distinct 90 kD E2 subunits, which had identified elecrophoretic mobilities when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were separated by hydroxyapetite HPLC in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
