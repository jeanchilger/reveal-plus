<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2010-01-29</DATELINE><TITLE>Molecular Diagnostics and Comparative Genomics in Clinical Microbiology</TITLE><BODY>Initially, the availability of molecular diagnostics was considered a panacea, but replacement of conventional tests for detection and identification of microorganisms by molecular procedures eventually gathered momentum. This chapter describes current state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics and comparative genomics in medical microbiology to provide an understanding of infectious disease over the coming years. Nucleic acid-based tests are being introduced with increasing speed into routine clinical microbiology laboratories. Some of the problems remaining to be solved prior to general acceptance of nucleic acid-mediated detection and identification of microbial pathogens are reviewed. Historic objections are slowly being taken apart, and an accelerated introduction of molecular diagnostics is being pursued in many cases. Clear improvement in clinical testing is achieved by introducing molecular tests. Therefore, swift introduction of such tests into clinical practice is important to be pursued. Several PCR tests show increased sensitivity, excellent specificity, and cost effectiveness highlighting the success of the novel applications in the field of bacterial infections. Finally, some of the problems remaining to be solved prior to general acceptation of nucleic acid-mediated detection and identification of microbial pathogens are also reviewed.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
