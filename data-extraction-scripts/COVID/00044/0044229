Combinations of antibodies have several advantages such as the capacities to target multiple and mutating antigens in complex pathogens and to engage varied epitopes on multiple disease-related antigens (e.g. receptors) to overcome heterogeneity and plasticity. Oligoclonal antibodies are an emerging therapeutic format in which a novel antibody combination is developed as a single drug product. Here, we will provide historical context on the use of oligoclonal antibodies in oncology and infectious diseases and will highlight practical considerations related to their preclinical and clinical development programs.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
