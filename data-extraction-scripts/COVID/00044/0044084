By exchanging of fragments of genetic material viruses gain important means leading to both variability and also to the repair of their genome. Biochemically, the processes of DNA and RNA recombination are different reflecting the specifics of DNA versus RNA replication as well as their use inside the cell. A variety of recombination mechanisms are discussed and illustrated by examples taken from specific viral species.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
