This expression can be controlled at various levels. This includes epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation or histone modifications. At the posttranscriptional level, regulation can be via alternative splicing or controlling messenger RNA (mRNA) stability. RNA cleavage is one way to control mRNA stability. For example, microRNA (miRNA)-induced mRNA cleavage has long been recognised in plants. RNA cleavage also appears to be widespread in other kingdoms of life, and it is now clear that mRNA cleavage plays critical functions in animals. Although miRNA-induced mRNA cleavage can occur in animals, it is not a widespread mechanism. Instead, mRNA cleavage can be induced by a range of other mechanisms, including by endogenous short inhibitory RNAs (endo-siRNAs), as well as the Ribonuclease III (RNase III) enzymes Drosha and Dicer. In addition, RNA cleavage induced by endo-siRNAs and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) is important for genome defence against transposons. Moreover, several RNase has been identified as important antiviral mediators. In this review, we will discuss these various RNA endonucleolytic cleavage mechanisms utilised by animals to regulate the expression of genes and as a defence against retrotransposons and viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
