The infected pigs did not show any diarrhoea or nervous symptoms, but they developed characteristic necrotizing enteritis and myenteric plexitis, accompanied by follicular necrosis in the Peyer's patches. ADV antigen was detected in the submucosa of the dome area of Peyer's patches, lymphatic follicles, Meissner's and Auerbach's plexuses, solar ganglia and thoracic spinal ganglia. These findings suggest that ADV spreads from the intestinal mucosa to the central nervous system via the autonomic nerves.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
