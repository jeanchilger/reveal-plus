The result showed that SAT05f could down-regulate TLR7/9-dependent IFN-α production in cultured human PBMC stimulated by inactivated Flu virus PR8 or HSV-1 or CpG ODN or imiquimod, protect d-GalN-treated mice from lethal shock induced by TLR9 agonist, not by TLR3/4 agonist. In addition, SAT05f significantly inhibit IFN-α production from purified human plasmacytoid cells (pDCs) stimulated by CpG ODN. Interestingly, SAT05f could up-regulate CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR on the pDCs in vitro, implying that SAT05f-mediated inhibition on IFN-α production could be related to the activation of pDCs. The data suggest that SAT05f could be developed as a candidate medicament for the treatment of TLR7/9 activation-associated diseases by inhibiting TLR7/9 signaling pathways.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
