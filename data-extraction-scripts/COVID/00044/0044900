The cDNA from three overlapping clones was sequenced by the chain termination method and two open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The largest ORF, 4350bp, encoded a polypeptide of 1449 amino acids of relative molecular mass (Mr) 159811, which contained 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a cysteine-rich region, and a potential transmembrane region. The C-terminal half of this ORF showed homology to the S proteins of four other coronaviruses. The other ORF consisted of the 3'-end of a gene with homology to the carboxyl terminus of the F2 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA polymerase.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
