<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2006-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Virucidal activity of a new hand disinfectant with reduced ethanol content: comparison with other alcohol-based formulations</TITLE><BODY>Summary A new formula with reduced ethanol content (55%) in combination with 10% propan-1-ol, 5.9% propan-1.2-diol, 5.7% butan-1.3-diol and 0.7% phosphoric acid exhibited a broad spectrum of virucidal activity. In quantitative suspension tests, with and without protein load, this formulation reduced the infectivity titre of seven enveloped (influenza A and B, herpes simplex 1 and 2, bovine corona, respiratory syncytial, vaccinia, hepatitis B, bovine viral diarrhoea) and four non-enveloped (hepatitis A, polio, rota, feline calici) viruses >103-fold within 30s. In comparative testing, only 95% ethanol showed similar levels of activity. In fingerpad tests, the formulation produced a log10 reduction factor of the titre of poliovirus type 1 (Sabin) of 3.04 in 30s compared with 1.32 by 60% propan-2-ol. Testing against feline calicivirus produced a log10 reduction factor of 2.38 by the test formulation; in contrast, the log10 reduction factors with 70% ethanol and 70% propan-1-ol were 0.68 and 0.70, respectively.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
