This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel v1.7 on bronchoscopy specimens. We tested 133 bronchial specimens (87 archived and 46 prospectively collected) with the FA RP and compared the results to the Luminex NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG RPP). After discordant analysis, 123 specimens gave concordant results using the FA RP and the NxTAG RPP for an overall agreement of 93.9% (kappa = 0.88 [95% CI 0.80–0.96]), a positive percent agreement of 93.7% (95% CI 83.7–97.7) and a negative percent agreement of 94.1% (95% CI 84.9–98.1). In conclusion, the BioFire FilmArray RP performed reliably to detect a broad range of respiratory pathogens in bronchoscopy specimens.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
