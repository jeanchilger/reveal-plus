The aim of this study was to determine whether the known rs12979860 and rs8099917 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in interleukin (IL)28B region, influence clinical features and natural history of bronchiolitis. Both SNPs showed no significant association with the risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), viral load, disease severity, and other clinical features of patients. Interestingly infants carrying IL28B rs12979860 TT genotype had lower age at hospital admission than that of infants carrying CC/CT genotypes. Overall our results indicate that both IL28B SNPs had no impact on the clinical course of bronchiolitis with the only exception of the IL28B rs12979860 SNP which increased the risk of hospitalization for bronchiolitis at early age.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
