To examine the role of other host factors in MHV infection in mice, IFN-γ-deficient mice with a BALB/c background (BALB-GKO) were infected intraperitoneally with MHV and compared with B6-GKO mice. In contrast to B6-GKO mice, BALB-GKO mice died within 1 week due to acute hepatic failure. The viral titer of the liver in BALB-GKO mice was significantly higher than that in B6-GKO mice. All hepatocytes in BALB-GKO mice were necrotic at 5 days post-infection, which was clearly distinct from large but limited lesion in the liver from infected B6-GKO mice. The serum alanine aminotransferase activity of infected BALB-GKO mice were higher than that of B6-GKO mice and was paralleled with the severity of the pathological changes and viral titers in infected mice. Administration of exogenous IFN-γ to BALB-GKO partially inhibited the acute death. These results indicate that BALB-GKO and B6-GKO mice clearly show different diseases following MHV infection, although wild type counterparts of both mice apparently showed the same clinical course after MHV infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
