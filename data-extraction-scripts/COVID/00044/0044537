This study aims to evaluate knowledge of IFT among emergency nurses of three Accident and Emergency Departments in Hong Kong. Methods Questionnaires were distributed to registered nurses of the three departments. Data was sought on participants’ characteristics, knowledge on equipment preparation and management of en route adverse events. Four clinical IFT scenarios were set for participants and answers were scored. Measured outcomes were defined as (1) relationships between clinical experience and relevant training in IFT with questionnaire results, (2) staff knowledge of the equipment carried routinely in ambulances and (3) the en route adverse events encountered according to the participants’ past experience. Results Participants’ test scores ranged from 24 to 37 (out of 40) with a mean of 30.6 (95% confidence interval 29.7–31.5). Participants with more clinical experience demonstrated significantly better test scores (p <0.05). Most participants were familiar with the monitoring devices carried in ambulances but were less familiar with the pharmacologic agents and airway devices available routinely in Hong Kong ambulances. Thirty participants (59%) had encountered en route adverse events in the past. Conclusion Nurses in emergency departments in Hong Kong have good knowledge of IFT. Extensive clinical experience is related to better IFT knowledge. IFT training for nurses should emphasize available ambulance service resources and capabilities.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
