Phosphate release assay and FRET-based assay of the ADK analogues showed that the ADKs selectively inhibit the duplex DNA-unwinding activity without significant impact on the helicase ATPase activity. Also, antiviral activities of the ADKs were shown dependent upon the substituent. Taken together, these results suggest that there might be ADK-specific binding site in the SCV Hel, which warrants further investigations with diverse ADKs to provide valuable insights into rational design of specific SCV Hel inhibitors.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
