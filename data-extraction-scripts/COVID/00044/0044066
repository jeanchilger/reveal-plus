Before an effective HIV-1 vaccine eliciting broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnmAbs) is fully developed, passive immunization for prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection may alleviate the burden caused by the pandemic. Among HIV-1 infected individuals, about 20% of them generated cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies two to four years after infection, the details of which could provide knowledge for effective vaccine design. Recent progress in techniques for isolation of human broadly neutralizing antibodies has facilitated the study of passive immunization. The isolation and characterization of large panels of potent human broadly neutralizing antibodies has revealed new insights into the principles of antibody-mediated neutralization of HIV. In this paper, we review the current effective techniques in broadly neutralizing antibody isolation.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
