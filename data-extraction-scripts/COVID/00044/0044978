Animals were distributed in 2 groups: COL + (n = 9) which received fresh colostrum from their own damns; and COL − (n = 10) which received frozen colostrums from donors. Heifers were assessed before colostrum intake – D0; D2; D7; D14; D21 and D28. Heifers were monitored by clinical examination, hematological profile and serum iron. COL − had a higher diarrhea intensity score (typically 3) on D7. Moreover, a single case each of bronchopneumonia and navel inflammation were observed in COL − calves. COL − had fewer red blood cells (RBC) (6.5 ± 0.8 × 10(6)/μL) and less hemoglobin (Hgb) (8.3 ± 1.4 g/dL) than COL + (RBC = 7.2 ± 0.8 × 10(6)/μL; Hgb = 9.6 ± 1.3 g/dL) at D14 (P ≤ 0.05). COL − had more anemia on D21 (P = 0.03) and on D28 (P = 0.02). Iron was lower in COL − (5.6 ± 2.7 μM/L) than COL + (10.7 ± 6.2 μM/L) (P = 0.03) on D7. Lymphocytes was lower in COL − than COL + on D7 (3.8 ± 1.0 × 10(3)/μL COL + and 5.4 ± 2.2 × 10(3)/μL COL −, P = 0.02). COL − calves had more anemia and lower serum iron concomitant with diarrhea on D7. The number of leukocytes was relatively consistent in the COL + calves, while COL − calves showed an increasing number of of lymphocytes starting on D7.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
