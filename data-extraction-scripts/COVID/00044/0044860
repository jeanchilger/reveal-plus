<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>1992-06-30</DATELINE><TITLE>A view from the common cold unit</TITLE><BODY>Abstract I have been asked to stand back and describe in broad terms the view I have had of common colds — probably the most frequent of acute human diseases and a long-lasting scientific problem — and in particular our recent work on antivirals. I should be able to do this for two reasons. Like everyone else I have suffered from colds, but in addition I have been studying the problem from the virological and clinical point of view for over 35 years — for the last 31 at the Common Cold Unit, Salisbury. As a result I may have problems with perspective — it is not possible to give a personal view and at the same time to describe something from every possible angle, and quite impossible to be comprehensive, but I have done my best and readers will make their own judgements and corrections.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
