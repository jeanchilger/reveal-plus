We demonstrate the difficulty of realising a phosphorylation step on the anomeric position of 2-deoxyribose, and we discover that introduction of fluorine atoms on the 2 position of 2-deoxyribose enables the phosphorylation step: in fact, the stability of the prodrugs increases with the degree of 2-fluorination. Stability studies of produgs of 2-fluoro-2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate and 2,2-difluoro-2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate in acidic and neutral conditions were conducted to confirm our observation. Biological evaluation of prodrugs of 2,2-difluoro-2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate for antiviral and cytotoxic activity is reported.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
