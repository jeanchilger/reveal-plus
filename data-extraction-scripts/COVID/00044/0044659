<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2003-05-03</DATELINE><TITLE>Haemorrhagic-fever-like changes and normal chest radiograph in a doctor with SARS</TITLE><BODY>A 33-year-old doctor contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome presenting with features of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy without changes in the chest radiograph initially. A CT scan of his chest showed marked lung changes. His condition improved with intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg daily and ribavirin 1·2 g orally thrice daily. The case illustrates the importance of a break in fever between the viraemic and lung inflammatory phases of the illness that occurs before radiographic changes and which may obscure diagnosis. Careful quarantine and follow-up of these patients are necessary. Coagulopathy is usually uncomplicated and early CT of the chest may elucidate hidden lung changes and facilitate a rapid diagnosis.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
