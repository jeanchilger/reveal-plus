<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2007-01-31</DATELINE><TITLE>Computer-Based Blood Donor Screening: A Status Report</TITLE><BODY>There is a substantial literature suggesting that computer-assisted interviewing has advantages over face-to-face and written self-administration of interviews in venues eliciting sensitive information similar to that sought in blood donor history screening. We review some of the recent developments in blood donor history screening, the evidence suggesting that automated interviews should be useful, and the experience to date using computer interviews for blood donation. These data suggest that automated computer-assisted interviewing increases the elicitation of behaviors associated with the risk of transfusion-transmissible infection in donors, improves donor and staff satisfaction, and reduces errors and omissions that frequently accompany traditional interviewing methods. Food and Drug Administration–cleared systems for computer-assisted self-interview of blood donors are briefly described.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
