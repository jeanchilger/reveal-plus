To simultaneously detect viruses that are involved in the aetiology of respiratory infections, we used a DNA/RNA microarray assay that identifies 17 different viruses or viral subtypes. Rhinopharyngeal washes were taken from 611 children (aged 1 month to 14 years) who presented in the emergency department with respiratory infections from June 2010 to June 2011 and were treated as outpatients (299, 48.9%) or hospitalized (312, 51.1%). Lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed more often in hospitalized children (68% versus 36%, p 0.001). Of 397 children in which microarrays detected viral infection (70.1%), a single virus was found in 228 (57.4%) and two or more viruses in 169 (42.5%). The most prevalent viruses among children with positive samples were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 225 (56.6%), parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 118 (29.7%), rhinovirus (RV) in 73 (18.4%), followed by influenza in 56 (14.1%), adenoviruses in 31 (7.8%), bocavirus in 25 (6.3%), human metapneumovirus in 15 (3.7%) and enteroviruses in 12 (3%). Most common viral co-infections were RSVA–RSVB in 46 children (27.2%), RSV–Influenza in 20 (11.8%), RSV–RV in 18 (10.6%) and PIV–RV in 13 (7.7%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that viral co-infections were associated with increased probability for hospitalization (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.01–2.29, p 0.04), and previous pneumococcal vaccination was associated with decreased probability for hospitalization (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33–0.81, p 0.004). We conclude that viral co-infections are involved in a significant proportion of children with an acute respiratory infection and may increase the severity of clinical presentation and the risk for hospitalization.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
