The issues of food safety and food poisoning are being increasingly emphasised, particularly in developed countries. Infection/contamination with many agents i.e., bacterial, parasitic and viral entities can result in foodborne illness. This article will focus mainly on viral agents of infection. A range of different viruses can cause food poisoning/foodborne infection, and infection can result in a myriad of symptoms, ranging from mild, acute disease to chronic, debilitating disease and even death. Due to the inherent differences between bacteria and viruses, namely the fact that viruses do not replicate in food, while bacteria do, viruses are frequently difficult to detect. This is compounded by the fact that many of the viruses associated with enteric disease do not replicate in cell culture. These factors can lead to a lag between reporting, detection and analysis of foodborne viruses versus bacterial agents. Despite these constraints, it is now evident that there are both well-established and emerging viruses implicated in foodborne infections, and the role of molecular detection and characterisation is becoming increasingly important.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
