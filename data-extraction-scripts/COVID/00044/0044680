SAMPLES AND METHODS: Serial HRCT scans in 39 patients with pneumonia complicating novel influenza A (H1N1) were reviewed for predominant patterns of lung abnormalities as well as distribution and extent of involvement. Longitudinal changes were assessed at different time points. RESULTS: In the early stage, the most common HRCT finding was patchy ground-glass opacity (GGO) (n = 4, 54.7%). In the progressive stage, bilaterally distributed GGO mixed with consolidation was the most commonly observed feature (n = 28, 71.8%). The diffuse pattern deteriorated to a peak (n = 17, 43.6%) at this stage. In the convalescent stage, the most common finding was fibrosis (n = 25, 64.1%). Averagely, fibrosis was observed at d 18.5 ± 6.4 after the onset of symptoms. Three patterns of longitudinal changes of the lesions were observed, including: type 1, improvement after deterioration; type 2, concurrent improvement and deterioration followed by improvement; and type 3, gradual improvement. Type 1 was the more common pattern (n = 27, 69.2%). Complete serial HRCT scans from initial and final scan were obtained in 24 patients, and the mean CT score peaked at d 8–14 of the illness. CONCLUSION: HRCT may play a role in detecting and characterizing pulmonary lesions for the cases of pneumonia complicating influenza A. In addition, it may contribute to monitoring longitudinal changes of pneumonia and assessing therapeutic response.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
