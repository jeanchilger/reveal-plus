Objectives To present the epidemiological profile and the main clinical characteristics showed by children infected with this virus in Spain. Study design We have studied the incidence of HBoV and other 15 respiratory viruses in 917 nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from 730 infants and children under age of 14 with acute lower respiratory tract infection from September-04 to August-06. Results HBoV was detected in 123 samples (13.4%) showing a seasonal distribution with November and December as the peak months. Out of the 558 samples which rendered a positive result for at least one of the virus tested, HBoV (22%) ranked fourth behind respiratory syncytial virus (181, 32%), adenoviruses (155, 28%) and rhinoviruses (136, 24%). Co-infections with HBoV and other respiratory viruses were detected in 74 out of 123 HBoV-positive specimens (60%). In addition, HBoV was also found in stool and, for the first time, in urine samples. Conclusions Results obtained provide further evidence that HBoV is involved in acute lower respiratory tract infections. HBoV-associated disease should not be limited to the respiratory tract.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
