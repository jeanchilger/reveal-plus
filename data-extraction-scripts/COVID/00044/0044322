They have been widely used in the development of infection models, leading to the generation of vaccines and drugs, as well as in the nonclinical pharmacologic and toxicologic assessment of biopharmaceuticals, especially in the fields of immunotherapy and oncology, despite the constant pressure to move to lower species. In many cases, NHPs are the only species that allows a correct risk assessment for humans. Nevertheless, limitations inherent to each species have to be considered before an investigation. This chapter shines some light on the respective interests and limitations of using cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and marmosets in medical research and nonclinical development, with a specific focus on reproduction and immunology.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
