Feed ingestions, weight gains, slaughter (SW) and carcass weights (CW), carcass conformation and fat scores, and meat characteristics (24hours postmortem): colour, pH, water holding capacity, chemical composition and texture (Warner Bratzler (WB) test, sensory panel), were studied. NW calves showed the highest SW and CW (P <0.001). Yellowness (b*), redness (a*) and chroma (C*) were higher in NW than W2 calves (P <0.05). Shear firmness was higher in W2 than in NW and W5 veal. W2 veal was less elastic (P <0.05), tender (P <0.05) and juicy (P <0.01) than NW and W5 veal.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
