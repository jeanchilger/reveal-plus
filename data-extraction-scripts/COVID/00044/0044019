The stability of the SEIRW model with time-varying perturbation to predict the evolution tendency of the disease is analyzed. Furthermore, we introduce a time-varying delay into the susceptible and infective stages in the model and give some global exponential stability criteria for the time-varying delay system. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the results.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
