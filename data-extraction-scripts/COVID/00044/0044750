HPeV-1 and 2 were originally classified as enteroviruses but the advent of sequence analysis led to them being recognized as a new genus in the picornavirus family. Subsequently, nine additional HPeV strains have been reported including HPeV-3 in 1999. 1 The spectrum of disease that these viruses may cause is still unknown, and they are rarely screened for in clinical practice.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
