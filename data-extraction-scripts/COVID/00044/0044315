The disease, originally termed “atypical pneumonia,” was first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5 months and eventually led to 8096 human infection cases and 774 deaths. A previously unrecognized coronavirus, named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as the causative agent of SARS. Subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections originated most likely from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets, with masked palm civets considered the most prominent and important carrier. Large-scale culling of civets appeared to be effective in preventing further outbreaks in the region. Subsequent epidemiological studies showed that civets are intermediate host of SARS-CoV and bats are the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and a large number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs). Detailed analysis of the massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data indicated that SARS-CoV experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as interspecies transmission from animals to humans. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV plays a key role in virus–host interaction and hence is a key determinant of interspecies transmission. It has been shown that minor changes of amino acid (aa) residues in the S protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus susceptibility in animal and human hosts. This chapter focuses on the genetics and evolution of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs in humans, civets, and bats. The events of SARS outbreaks and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular epidemiology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broaden the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
