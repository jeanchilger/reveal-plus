The regulation of their catalytic activity is of high importance and a great effort has been devoted in developing synthetic inhibitors. We summarize the most important small-molecule synthetic PLA2 inhibitors developed to target each one of the four major types of human PLA2 (cytosolic cPLA2, calcium-independent iPLA2, secreted sPLA2, and lipoprotein-associated LpPLA2). We discuss recent applications of inhibitors to understand the role of each PLA2 type and their therapeutic potential. Potent and selective PLA2 inhibitors have been developed. Although some of them have been evaluated in clinical trials, none reached the market yet. Apart from their importance as potential medicinal agents, PLA2 inhibitors are excellent tools to unveil the role that each PLA2 type plays in cells and in vivo. Modern medicinal chemistry approaches are expected to generate improved PLA2 inhibitors as new agents to treat inflammatory diseases.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
