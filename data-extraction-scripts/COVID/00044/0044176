The effects of various factors such as extraction solvent, solvent concentration, temperature, solvent to solid ratio, ultrasound power, extraction time and particle size on the yield of target components were investigated. The optimal UAE conditions found were: 70% (v/v) methanol solution, temperature 45°C, solvent to solid ratio 15ml/g, ultrasound power 150W, extraction time 45min and particle size 60–80 mesh. The results indicated that compared with ME at 18h and SE at 6h, UAE gave the highest extraction yields of tectoridin, iristectorin B, iristectorin A, tectorigenin, iristectorigenin A and total isoflavones at 45min. The results indicated that UAE was an alternative method for extracting isoflavones from I. tectorum.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
