The N gene encoding the N protein was cloned and expressed as a fusion protein with His tag protein in E. coli. The recombinant N protein was migrated at 48kDa and reacted with six histidine tag specific monoclonal antibody by immunoblotting. Recombinant N protein ELISA (rnELISA) demonstrated 98.7% specificities among (80) PEDV-free individuals, and 98% sensitivity ranging among (103) clinical samples with PEDV. On testing 884 field samples, an overall agreement of 88.3% was generated between the SN and rnELISA. Taken together, these results indicated that nucleocapsid protein may be a useful antigen for the sera-diagnosis of PEDV and it was also suggested that the ELISA is a highly sensitive and specific test for detecting antibodies to PEDV.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
