One such strategy involves using the different immune routes with DNA vaccines. In the present study, the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine, induced by using the current routine vaccination routes (intramuscularly, by electroporation, or orally using live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium), was compared in mouse model. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that immunization intramuscularly induced a moderate T cell response and antibody response. Mice administrated by electroporation induced the highest antibody response among the three immunization groups and a mid-level of cellular response. In contrast, the orally DNA vaccine evoked vigorous T cell response and a weak antibody production. These results indicated that the distinct types of immune responses were generated by the different routes of DNA immunization. In addition, our results also show that the delivery of DNA vaccines by electroporation and orally using live-attenuated Salmonella in vivo is an effective method to increase the immune responses. Further studies could be carried out using a combination strategy of both oral and electroporation immunizations to stimulate higher cellular and humoral immune responses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
