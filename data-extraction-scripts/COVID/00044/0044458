Lectures and panel discussions centered on international cooperation for better access to vaccines, and partnerships in areas ranging from vaccine research and process development, to clinical studies, regulatory, supply chain and emergency preparedness and response. Global vaccine market trends and changes that will impact vaccine financing and procurement methods were discussed as well as capital sources, including funding, for the development of new or improved vaccines. DCVMN members presented their progress in developing novel Hexavalent, Meningitis, Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, Shigella, Mumps, Rotavirus, Yellow Fever, Polio, Hepatitis E and Dengue vaccines, and a novel monoclonal antibody cocktail for post-bite prophylaxis against rabies infections. Access to and availability of vaccines is enhanced through sharing of best practices for vaccine quality control, reducing redundant testing and promoting development of harmonized common standards. Eligible stakeholders were encouraged to join the WHO-National Control Laboratory Network for Biologicals which serves as a platform for collaboration and technical exchange in this area. Increasing regulatory convergence at the regional and global levels through mechanisms such as joint dossier review and the WHO Collaborative Registration Procedure can help to accelerate vaccine access globally. Additionally, four proposals for streamlining procedures and alignment of dossiers were discussed. Successful partnerships between a broad range of stakeholders, including international organizations, manufacturers, academic research institutes and regulators have provided support for, and in some cases accelerated, vaccine innovation, clinical trials and registration, WHO prequalification, vaccine introduction and access. Strong partnerships, based on experience and trust, help leverage opportunities and are critically important to advancing the shared goal of providing quality vaccines for all people.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
