However, knowledge regarding whether negative-strand RNA viruses take advantage of intracellular membranes for replication is limited. Here we show that a negative-strand RNA virus, human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), remodels the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to form inclusion bodies (IBs), whereby the phosphoprotein (P) of HPIV3 recruits phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) to IBs to generate PI4P, creating a PI4P-enriched microenvironment to promote HPIV3 replication. In addition, we find that human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) also takes advantage of the ER to form IBs and that these IBs are also enriched with PI4P. The nucleoprotein of HRSV recruits PI4KB to IBs. These results suggest that paramyxoviruses also exploit the host endomembrane to form IBs and that PI4KB is recruited by viral proteins to enrich IBs with PI4P to facilitate viral replication.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
