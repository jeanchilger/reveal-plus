<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2016-01-12</DATELINE><TITLE>Recent Advances in the Discovery of Deubiquitinating Enzyme Inhibitors</TITLE><BODY>This review examines the small molecules described over the past decade as inhibitors of any of the approximately 100 human deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Structures from patent publications as well as from the primary literature are included. Inhibitors of two viral DUBs are also described since these proteases share structural similarity with one of the human DUB sub-families. The structure, function and disease associations of certain DUBs are presented. The evolution of the screening assays used to identify and characterise new inhibitors is discussed. Several emerging trends in the series are highlighted and the ‘drug-likeness’ of the various inhibitors is analysed. Large pharmaceutical company collaborations have drawn attention to this field, and these recent advances are discussed in the context of the wider range of therapeutically important DUB targets.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
