This investigation employed the SST k − ω model to simulate gasper-induced jet flow with the use of detailed gasper geometry, and validated the simulation results using experimental data. The validated CFD results not only revealed the mixing mechanism of a gasper-induced jet with ambient air, but also enabled the development of two mathematical models for characterizing the jet development along the gasper axis and radial velocity profiles in the downstream region. Furthermore, these models enabled the prediction of the entrainment ratio at different locations along a gasper-induced jet, and this ratio was used to evaluate the impact of the jet on air quality in a passenger’s breathing zone. The performance of the CFD model and mathematical models was evaluated, and the models were compared on the basis of prediction accuracy and computing time.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
