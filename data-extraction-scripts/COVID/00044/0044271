First, we screened SARS N and S amino acid sequences for allele-specific motif matching those in human HLA-A2.1 MHC-I molecules. From HLA peptide binding predictions (http://thr.cit.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind/), ten each potential N- and S-specific HLA-A2.1-binding peptides were synthesized. The high affinity HLA-A2.1 peptides were validated by T2-cell stabilization assays, with immunogenicity assays revealing peptides N223–231, N227–235, and N317–325 to be the first identified HLA-A∗0201-restricted CTL epitopes of SARS-CoV N protein. In addition, previous reports identified three HLA-A∗0201-restricted CTL epitopes of S protein (S978–986, S1203–1211, and S1167–1175), here we found two novel peptides S787–795 and S1042–1050 as S-specific CTL epitopes. Moreover, our identified N317–325 and S1042–1050 CTL epitopes could induce recall responses when IFN-γ stimulation of blood CD8+ T-cells revealed significant difference between normal healthy donors and SARS-recovered patients after those PBMCs were in vitro vaccinated with their cognate antigen. Our results would provide a new insight into the development of therapeutic vaccine in SARS.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
