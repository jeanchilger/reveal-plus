Viral infections have a greater impact on CF patients compared to non-CF controls. They result in increased respiratory symptoms, deterioration of Shwachman and radiological scores, prolonged hospitalizations, a persistent decrease of pulmonary function, increased use of antibiotics and a higher frequency of exacerbations at follow-up. In addition, interaction between viruses and bacteria in CF is suggested. Some studies observe increased new bacterial colonization and raised antipseudomonal antibodies in episodes of viral respiratory infections. Experimental data suggest that increased virus replication, impaired specific anti-bacterial defense and increased adherence of bacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of viral respiratory infections in CF. Further knowledge about the role of viruses and interaction with bacteria in CF lung disease might result in new therapeutic strategies to improve prognosis of CF patients.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
