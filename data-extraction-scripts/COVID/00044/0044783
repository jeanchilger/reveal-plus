It is recognized that Eulerian or Lagrangian approach has its own merits and limitations. A new Eulerian model has been developed and it adopts a simplified drift–flux methodology in which external forces can be incorporated straightforwardly. A new near-wall treatment is applied to take into account the anisotropic turbulence for the modified Lagrangian model. In the present work, we present and compare both Eulerian and Lagrangian models to simulate particle dispersion in a small chamber. Results reveal that the standard k–ε Lagrangian model over-predicts particle deposition compared to the present turbulence-corrected Lagrangian approach. Prediction by the Eulerian model agrees well with the modified Lagrangian model.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
