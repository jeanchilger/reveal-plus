Numerous management factors influence the epidemiological and clinical picture associated with C. parvum infections in cattle. Whereas C. parvum is highly prevalent in young dairy calves and confined beef calves, it occurs rarely in calves on range and in adult cattle. In well-managed herds, clinical disease due to C. parvum is also rare. Therefore, C. parvum infections in cattle might not be as important as current perceptions would indicate.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
