Now, we observe a spectrum of diverse diseases that cannot be properly managed with a simple strategy developed in the age of infectious diseases. Because our living environment changes so quickly, the response of the human body, such as the genes or epigenetic program, cannot keep up with it if we continue the current strategy. We need to find a way to enable adaptation of the human body program to change. Medical education should also be changed to focus on the harmony and balance of complexly entangled systems. Addressing such a need for changes, “systems medicine” is a new approach to achieving breakthroughs in disease prevention and treatment by obtaining and using fairly comprehensive information, such as molecular-, gene-, and cell-level information, as well as lifestyle, clinical, physiological, and environmental information.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
