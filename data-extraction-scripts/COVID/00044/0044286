SLAM suppression was assessed using real-time PCR and flow cytometry to confirm suppression at the m-RNA and protein levels, respectively. Three chemically synthesized siRNAs were transfected individually using oligofectamine into B95a cell line. This resulted in SLAM suppression from 48 to 454-folds, in comparison to the untransfected B95a cell line. When the SLAM suppressed B95a cell line was infected with PPRV, replication was reduced by 12–143-folds and virus titre was reduced from log10 1.09 to 2.28. siRNA 3 showed the most potent inhibition of SLAM expression both at m-RNA and protein levels. This also caused the maximum reduction of virus replication and virus titre. A 100-fold reduction in PPRV titres was seen in anti-SLAM antibody neutralized B95a cell line. This further confirms that SLAM is one of the (co) receptors for PPRV. However, the presence of other putative virus receptor(s) is/are not ruled out.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
