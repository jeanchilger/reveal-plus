Cytological examination of pleural exudates revealed severe purulent inflammation with abundant clusters of rod-shaped microorganisms with a clear surrounding halo. Treatment was ineffective and the ferrets died 2–5 days later. Two ferrets were subjected to necropsy examination, which revealed pyothorax, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and multiple white nodules (1–2mm) in the lungs. Microscopical examination showed multifocal necrotizing-pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia and lymphadenitis with aggregates of encapsulated microorganisms, some of which were positively stained by periodic acid–Schiff and alcian blue. In-situ hybridization for Pneumocystis spp., Ziehl–Neelsen staining and immunohistochemistry for distemper, coronavirus and influenza antigen were negative in all cases. Electron microscopically, the bacteria were 2–3μm long with a thick electron-lucent capsule. Microbiology from one ferret yielded a pure culture of gram-negative bacteria identified phenotypically as Pseudomonas luteola. This speciation was later confirmed by 16S RNA gene amplification.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
