In this study, a subunit vaccine formulation containing only recombinant, soluble, attachment glycoprotein from HeV (sG(HeV)) and CpG adjuvant was evaluated as a potential NiV vaccine in the cat model. Different amounts of sG(HeV) were employed and sG-induced immunity were examined. Vaccinated animals demonstrated varying levels of NiV–specific Ig systemically and importantly, all vaccinated cats possessed antigen-specific IgA on the mucosa. Upon oronasal challenge with NiV (50,000 TCID(50)), all vaccinated animals were protected from disease although virus was detected on day 21 post-challenge in one animal. The ability to elicit protective systemic and mucosal immunity in this animal model provides significant progress towards the development of a human subunit vaccine against henipaviruses.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
