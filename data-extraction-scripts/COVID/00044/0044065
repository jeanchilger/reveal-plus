Objectives To study the clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients aged ≥ 15 years and diagnosed with RSV infection. Study design Both retrospective and prospective cohort studies were conducted at a university hospital between May 2014 and December 2015. Results: RSV was detected in 86 of 1562(5.5%) adult hospitalized patients suspected of respiratory viral infection. Sixty-nine patients were included in the study. RSV was detected by RT-PCR (82.6%), IFA (10.1%), and both RT-PCR and IFA (7.3%). Most patients (87.0%) were aged ≥ 50 years. Cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, immunocompromised hosts, and diabetes were the major comorbidities. The common manifestations were cough (92.8%), dyspnea (91.3%), sputum production (87.0%), tachypnea (75.4%), wheezing (73.9%), and fever (71.0%). Fifty- five patients (79.7%) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Hypoxemia (SpO2 ≤ 92%) was found in 53.6% patients. Twenty-five of 69(36.2%) patients developed respiratory failure and required ventilatory support. Cardiovascular complications were found in 24.6% of patients. Congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (MI), new atrial fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia were found in 9(13.0%), 7(10.1%), 4(5.8%), and 3(4.3%) of 69 patients, respectively. Overall mortality was 15.9%. Pneumonia (81.8%) and acute MI (18.2%) were the major causes of death. Conclusions Most adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection were of advanced age and had comorbidities. Cardiopulmonary complications were the major causes of death. Management and prevention of RSV infection in these vulnerable groups are necessary.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
