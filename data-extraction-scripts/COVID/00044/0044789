However, most of basic information about the vital functions related to anti-viral activity has been unclear. For evaluating some animals as a natural reservoir or host of infectious pathogens, it is necessary that not only their immune system but also their biology, the environment of their living, food habits and physiological features should be clarified and they should be analyzed from these multi-view points. The majority of current studies on infectious diseases have been conducted for the elucidation of viral virulence using experimental animals or viral gene function in vitro, but in a few case, researchers focused on wild animal itself. In this paper, we described basic information about bats as follows; genetic background, character of the immunological factors, histological character of immune organs, the physiological function and sensitivity of bat cells to viral infection.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
