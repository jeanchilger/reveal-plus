<TEXT>&#2;<DATELINE>2019-11-30</DATELINE><TITLE>Outbreak response as an essential component of vaccine development</TITLE><BODY>Summary The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was created as a result of an emerging global consensus that a coordinated, international, and intergovernmental effort was needed to develop and deploy new vaccines to prevent future epidemics. Although some disease outbreaks can be relatively brief, early outbreak response activities can provide important opportunities to make progress on vaccine development. CEPI has identified six such areas and is prepared to work with other organisations in the global community to combat WHO priority pathogens, including the hypothetical Disease X, by supporting early activities in these areas, even when vaccine candidates are not yet available.&#3;</BODY></TEXT>
